my poor little meow meow, this is by far the song that saves the back half of this album and its also my favorite song on the album just barely an inch ahead of LA Devotee, I listened to this song on a weekly basis, I still dont know why I went as hard for it as I did but theres something about that second chorus where that sounds like someone running away from thier problems and everything that just gave me such a fun visual of this song. this is a serious option for my 11 and this is the one song from the album that had to go and become a tiktok trend. Im not on that app at all and I simply thought more people caught onto the wave that this was the best song on the album but no its just runing rampagae on the clock app and im sure thats gonna make it suffer.

Honestly It didnt suffer too much from that and im glad it made it to day 3 but it should've been the last panic song left so im sad to see it go 

---


**king bestie** (11): so good i forgot how to form thoughts

**moonagenightmares** (11): cant even explain why i love this song so much but i do

**1998tweety** (10): this was cunt

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): I’m sad that this blew up on TikTok before old songs started coming back to radio, because I would’ve LOVED to hear this song daily on the radio.

**CarlieScion** (10): will this win or be tanked based on tiktok vitality? Only time will tell

**hikk** (10): joker amv core

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Honestly this is probably the best song on the album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I don't know why but this song gives me a haunted house vibe

**intheaftermath** (10): this song is so insanely good that TikTok getting to it still isn't enough to hurt my rating.

**isthesweetestcon** (10): holy shit i LOVE this???? please stop with the dad rock imitations of panic if you can still make this. okay so the chorus still sounds dad rock but. i can forgive it here.

**whoisValensi** (10): Gotta admit seeing the fucking sped up/slowed down versions of this getting released for TikTok was one of the funniest fucking experiences of last year's entire everything involving P!ATD.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.9): i refuse to give this a 10 i just Can Not

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (9.1): another villain song

**Awkward\_King** (9): never being able to rate panics first four albums is going to upset me for the rest of my life

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Finally, a story worth the drama that they’re pouring into these songs! Weird comment but if you changed the sound palate a bit this could be an early Halsey song.

**mysario** (9): stream the Sped Up Version and Slowed Version simultaneously with this one

**plastichaxan** (9): They used the last bit of good music left in them in a few songs of this album

**ScrtSuperhero** (9): - he sounds so good on the bridge

**throwaway-7650** (9): is it too early to start campaigning for this in tiktok 2?

**-y-y-y-** (8.5): , a far-behind second to Golden Days but still very poignant

**akanewasright** (8.5): me having not seen any TikToks with this song: “wow maybe TikTok did the right thing in blowing this song up”

**criestotheclicking** (7.7): This is such a minor gripe but this song always reminds me of how people always go on about how underrated it is. So I feel like now it is reflexively properly rated. Good song, screechy bridge (you could say that about a few songs on this record…).

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): the bridge really carried here

**Bandito21Dema** (7): very fun

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i remember when I was playing SongPop against my sister, who was a big Panic! fan, this song came up a lot so I memorized the “We bui-” so i would get it in like .5 seconds

**jay** (7): i wouldve given this an extra point if it was "haus of memories"

**modulum83** (7): seth macfarlane would kill this shit

**welcome2thejam** (7): Alright, this was a tad dull for a while, but that back third straight hard carried to a decent score

**impla77** (6.8): Have been acclimatised to this thanks to TikTok

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is the worst thing a song in this rate can be: boring

**dreamingpastel** (6): The part where it slows down before the bridge is...weird. Everything else is fine.

**nt96** (6): the switch-up was pretty nice but that millennial whoop is not it, im sorry

**pig-serpent** (6): Now that this is a random tiktok hit years later, it completes the trifecta of my three least favorite songs on this album being the three biggest hits.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Kinda boring

**bogo** (5): why did this pop off on tiktok, like what was the reason searches online oh it was evil reasons i see

**heysoupie** (5): ironically, also forgettable

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): my favorite Weeknd mixtape! at the Disco

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (4.4): people give so much fucking flack to thomas yorke for his falsetto, but at least dude was a real sulkly lil' binch with it. urie goes for anthemic "they're MY toys and I'm gonna play with them NOW" vibe. but also? it's vaguely passable "bad mid". honestly I think any points im gonna give this album ride on the fact that his falsetto ignites something in my mind that makes me giggle.

**apatel27** (4): It's mediocre arena pop rock

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): this is such a theatre kid song. moreso than the rest of the album which is really saying something

**runaway3212** (4): wish I could forgot her

**starlitsuns** (4): so painfully mid

**Uberpigeon** (4): can we can it with the wooaahs

**nick1372** (3.5): Overrated. There's a specific type of song that relies too much on a "sad" chord structure that rubs me the wrong way. I don't know how to word it in music speak but it feels like I'm being told to feel emotional instead of shown a reason to.

**frogaranaman** (3): sounds like NFL walk out music

**velvet-gloves** (3): completely forgettable. the only DOAB track i could not initially recall any part of the melody from looking at the title.

**whatsanillinois** (3): i hate his falsetto

**daythreeinmiami** (2.5): I will not be leaving this song in my house of memories; it’s going straight to the bin. Bye.

**emoforever1927** (1): love the lyrics hate the tune

**Hulnia** (1): this feels like it should have a big edm drop in it. not that it would’ve made it any better but still.

I will go to bat for this song and truly for what. One of the first times I listened to this album was on a trip to new york and I remember I threw this album on once we got to the uber to the hotel and this song came on right as we were on the innerstate and it was cold wet and rainy in new york and it was really just a vibe i liked it.

If it was up to me this song would be WINNING

---

**impla77** (11): My sister downloaded this on iTunes, so my adolescent self was exposed to this.

**CarlieScion** (10): I REMEMBER!!!!!

**followingfreeways** (10): UNDERRATED!!!!!!!!

**jackisboredtoday** (10): very nearly my 11 in this rate, the prechorus to this is just divine

**king bestie** (10): i will not be explaining myself

**pig-serpent** (10): I thought about this song a lot when walking back to my college dorm in the rain at night.

**ScrtSuperhero** (10): - Feels like waiting for a long lost love in the rain, has my whole heart

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): wait why was this my least favorite song on the album when i was younger this is amazing wow

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The fact that this album has two unnecessary ballads and they somehow both don't suck

**whoisValensi** (10): Nah see shit like this is why FOB is my favorite of the three here today because, the fucking imagery in the lyrics, the way Patrick puts his literal everything into singing them, the way every note always seems to hit just right... Yeah. That's the good shit.

**-y-y-y-** (9.7): , i distinctly remember sitting in the shower in the dark fully clothed listening to this song in a particularly angsty moment

**BreadlessCrust** (9.1): DID YOU NEVER WANT TO BE ALONE

**cremeebrulee** (9): :sobsing:

**velvet-gloves** (9): the vocals were a serve and a half

**modulum83** (8.3): patrick stump sings everything like he is experiencing human emotions for the first time ever

**akanewasright** (8): I just like these silly little guys

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Needs a harmonica.

**Bandito21Dema** (8): this song makes me cry

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**isthesweetestcon** (7): i miss how emo used to be but i can dig this

**nick1372** (7): I really love how the verses sound but I truly have no idea whats going on

**LilacDaffodils** (6.8): I have no memory of listening to this album but I seem to know all the songs

**daythreeinmiami** (6.7): What the fuck is a jet pack blue and how the fuck have you felt it? What? Ugh whatever I’ll forgive it as this is so far the strongest song on this album.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): /checks notes JUDY GARLAND?!

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (6): average

**steelstepladder** (6): I got that Jet Pack Blues, tell me your favorite song

**welcome2thejam** (6): Jet pack is just the kind of quirky add-on that works for some artists but not for others: 2000s Fall Out Boy could probably sneak through as the former, 2015 Fall Out Boy annoys me deeply in the latter

**heysoupie** (5.4): passively listening to this song, I had hope for it bc I do like the vocals. Then I looked at the lyrics and they’re…blah? I’m seriously struggling to think about whether FOB ever had good lyrics at this point.

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.3): this one has strong "stomp n' holler" energy. the ending chord almost piqued me, but alas it's just pomo anonymous mid.

**frogaranaman** (5): idk why I’m thinking about Phineas and Ferb but

**IIIHenryIII** (5): go home

**Uberpigeon** (5): is this about judy jetson

**criestotheclicking** (4.7): feels like centuries 2.0 but with a worse chorus.

**intheaftermath** (4.5): feels a bit like filler compared to its surrounding tracks

**runaway3212** (4.5): this is such a random meh

**Awkward\_King** (4): my funny isnt screwed on today roxie im sorry

**bogo** (4): those I REMEMBERs get real grating after a while

**emoforever1927** (4): pretty but just not for me right now

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Cool title but the central image has little to do with the song itself.

**jay** (4): no

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): atrocious hook

**dreamingpastel** (3): It had such a good start, but it goes downhill once the chorus hits.

I've always seen this song a the younger sibling to 'The Pheonix' from sr&r, its brash and in your face and i love it. While doing the writeups for this album I learned that this song was inspired by Trayvon Martin/ alot of the 2014 BLM Uprising according to a comment on the genuis page. I struggled to find the official source for where it came from but on the website when the song dropped pete included a quote from Fred Hampton among other things,  which I really do love and I wish I would've known about at the time because I think it would've would've added something to my often unsure feelings about being a black fan in these spaces 

---

**BreadlessCrust** (11): i wish i could have relations with this song

**dreamingpastel** (11): Absolutely fantastic all around.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): :kirbyshout: songs with this title are only bangers, shout out to Frank Ocean

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): sounds like it’s straight off save rock and roll and that’s why it’s the best song on the album!

**nick1372** (10): this is just the perfect early 2010s pop punk cheese

**pig-serpent** (10): While most of this album has slightly worn off me since coming out, this is the one song I feel like I appreciate more every time I hear it, even 8 years later.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): TALENTED BRILLIANT INCREDIBLE AMAZING SHOWSTOPPING ECT I LOVE THIS SONG SO FUCKING MUCH if uma thurman wasnt one of my favorite songs ever this would be SUCH an easy 11 from me holy shit i want to inject the energy of this song in my veins

**timothy444** (10): There's this certain line in this chorus where Patrick sings really low and then really high and it's such a magical melody and ummmpppphh it's so sexy in a straight kinda way

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The Phoenix…TWO!!!

**whoisValensi** (10): If "Twin Skeleton's" wasn't also on this album, this would so so so so so so easily be my 11. I'll try to keep shit brief but like, ah it hits me right in the angsty BONES. Again, like most of this album, highly just recommend blasting this album and just screaming the lyrics once you learn them cause DAMN.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this rate is going to destroy any faith i had left in popheads i can just tell

**king bestie** (9.5): i’ve been suspicious of bluebirds ever since

**Stryxen** (9.5): awesome

**modulum83** (9.3): if i ever get cursed with lycanthropy and am forced to periodically turn into a large ripped hulking bloodthirsty werewolf under the full moon i would like to hear this song every time i undergo my terrifying transformation fr

**cremeebrulee** (9): zillenial political revolution autogenerated spotify playlist core

**isthesweetestcon** (9): might as well embrace the new era of emo, this slaps

**moonagenightmares** (9): love the distortions and weird noises

**seanderlust** (9): the spiritual successor to the phoenix (which also went tf off)

**xxipil0ts** (9): : I DIDN'T REMEMBER THIS BEING SO GOOD?!?!?!!

**mysario** (8.2): Frank Ocean in shambles

**CarlieScion** (8): “I am your worst nightmare” - fall out boy making M A N I A

**ScrtSuperhero** (8): - I had to take this off my driving playlist bc I'd start speeding

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): why are you saying this is a black ski mask song like thats a thing

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (7.5): I like this one

**velvet-gloves** (7.5): i feel like i SHOULD like the song more than i do

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I mean its not my favorite Black Skinhead-alike but I still listened religiously in high school so…

**-y-y-y-** (7): , I don't know what the fuck Patrick is doing with his voice on this chorus but it's the best kind of dumb

**Bandito21Dema** (7): yay angry patrick

**ImADudeDuh** (7): tbh i don’t remember this one but its kinda a bop

**runaway3212** (7): please give novacane your 11s in AS6

**1998tweety** (6.5): bops a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): If I heard a kid at school listening to this I would tell administration I was worried that they were gonna shoot the place up, but it’s not bad.

**TiltControls** (6.5): this is the third time we've rated a song with novocaine in the title and every one of them has a different spelling for some reason???

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i’m happy this is here because it means we get a frank ocean interlude but i can’t understand half of what he’s saying

**welcome2thejam** (6): Bluebird bit in the prechorus sounds solid

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.5): sometimes i wanna give songs with novocaine in the title the 11 they need. other times you gotta hit them with that 5.5 bc it's a little cluttered in the mix, at time 0 worthy. Yet, the disco 4/4 drum is keeping me swaying. it's a lil' stinker worthy of a head pat.

**heysoupie** (5.2): why is the mixing of this song so terrible? I feel like I never had to think about mixing on past FOB albums bc it was always so big and magical sounding but this…why does it sound like Patrick yelling from 2 feet away from a mic and I’m listening to the song through a rolled up car window?

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): This one scares me, but the chorus kinda slaps.

**bigbigbee** (5): probably the most emo song in this rate…not in the sense of *the emo genre* or anything, just like a song that makes you say OK son, would you like me to take you to Hot Topic for more Rick and Morty merch

**criestotheclicking** (5): this song has a lot of good ideas but it’s a mess.

**frogaranaman** (5): like the drug this makes me sleepy

**impla77** (4.7): still not over the Frank Ocean robbery

**apatel27** (4): Frank Ocean comment

**IIIHenryIII** (4): that pre-chorus doesn't deserve to be part of such a mediocre song

**jay** (3): that intro was petrifying... i felt like han solo frozen in place

**steelstepladder** (3): The bluebirds don't know shit... these pretty boys also need to stop singing about how they're gonna kick my ass because no

**daythreeinmiami** (2): This is so chaotic. I have no idea what to focus on. It’s like they found vocal distortion for the first time and decided to just go for it.

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): what's with that deep voice attempt you can barely hear it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): Fuck Centuries for being so bad that I couldn’t 11 and 0 a song with the same title (basically) within two months.

**whatsanillinois** (1): those background vocals are so disgusting

Banger!!! Honestly maybe Brendon should go back to writing songs about his marriage because this one is cute!

---

**runaway3212** (11): girl that show is never gonna die like

**ScrtSuperhero** (11): - in a discography FULL of songs about his wife, this is truly Urie's best. The somber tone the song starts with, the eulogy evoking title, the Sinatra mimicry, all leading into the bombastic *celebration* of the end of his bachelorhood is just perfect. Totally upends expectations, great display of his vocal ability, truly my favorite Panic song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): "smile even though you're sad" i am trying brendon believe me

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): F**king BANGER. Nothing else to say.

**Bandito21Dema** (10): because I did it for a school project and my mom hates it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): He injected just a little bit of Frank Sinatra’s preserved blood before recording this ngl.

**CarlieScion** (10): I hate men!!!!!!

**celladonn** (10): brendan's frank sinatra slay

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): maybe this song is the real reason why I seem to form crushes on guys who do crooning.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I think Panic are at their best when they truly lean into their theatre kid energy- the more subdued, jazzy vibe really suits Brendon’s voice well and holds him back from his tendency to screlt. I’m always a sucker for a song with “solo sad guy karaoke” energy too. However I have a special fondness for this song because [there’s an old video Jaidynn Diore Fierce lip synching it with J-Sette choreography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKcUVCtfuy4) and she kinda served.

**hikk** (10): frank sinatra is rolling in his grave

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the one and only bachelor's party anthem

**poemforsmallthings** (10): forgive me lord but he served

**Stryxen** (10): my best friend’s favourite song, even irloomf was gagging

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): kinda ended hyperpop with that intro

**throwaway-7650** (10): omg I'm getting traumatic AP language flashbacks

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Oh god all these songs are taking me back to simpler times when all I had to worry about was writing essays and getting yelled at by my choir teacher

**whoisValensi** (9.5): My mom likes this song. Yeah that's it.

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (9): suave and smooth

**ktajlili** (9): iconic

**rotating3Dtext** (9): the musical-like songs from brendon are good

**velvet-gloves** (8.9): great vibe, exquisite vocals, but the dynamics of the song feel a little off. and i'm nitpicking but the drum is too prominent in the mixing.

**isthesweetestcon** (8.8): socially interesting which is more than i can say about most of these so far

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): wild that this was the first time they made a title track

**nick1372** (8.5): somehow cheesy and heartfelt and ridiculous and somehow it works

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): ik house of memories was going tiktok viral, but i didn’t realize the “and when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?” audio was from this album too

**dreamingpastel** (8): Brendon sounds great here.

**king bestie** (8): this is every theatre kids favourite song on the album

**MassiveThief** (8): I miss when Brendon was destroying his vocal chords but actually sounded good doing it

**nt96** (8): better than I remember

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): impressed her lace dress can tangle his neck

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**heysoupie** (7.4): At first I was like is P!atD pop? And this song answer that q w/ a resolute yes

**modulum83** (7.3): this is the closest i will ever go to enjoying electro swing so help me god

**criestotheclicking** (7): a song I can say is actually good! A nice ode to being married. Also a reprieve from Brendon screeching into my ears.

**emoforever1927** (7): took me a while in the past to get this to a 7 but I have really loved this song lately!

**steelstepladder** (7): Definitely the best song so far

**xxipil0ts** (6.8): : he should really just shut up and do theatre for his life.

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (6.7): Kind of boring, but the Sinatra vibes are interesting.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): i appreciate what he’s going for here but it isn’t really my thing

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I don’t think that this song is sexist, per se, but god this is such a typical straight man way to think about marriage

**-y-y-y-** (6): , my mum wants this to be the mother/son dance at my wedding but fuck me it's badly mixed

**daythreeinmiami** (6): I find the lyrics kinda annoying in this but I have to admit the 808’s work with the old timeywimeyness of the song.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the production really lets this song down

**timothy444** (6): Listenable but was it really necessary to have that trap bass and other weird instrumental choices throughout the entire song?

**impla77** (5.2): If theres one thing Brendan can do worse than Freddie, I guess its Frank

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): not bad but kinda meh

**pig-serpent** (5): My creative writing teacher always told us to not confuse the climax (the peak tension of the story) with the inciting incident of the story (the moment that starts the plot), and every so often I find a song that builds to what it thinks is a huge peak that really should've just been where the song started.  The last 1/3 of this song is so good, but if it was the first 1/3 and grew from there?  This song would be phenomenal.

**welcome2thejam** (5): "And yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor bride's groom just did lounge"

**whatsanillinois** (5): he wants to be james blake so bad

**emayzee** (4.5): why were people losing their mind for this sinatra-esque delivery over a trap beat

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (4.2): the death of a bachelor is not sad if the bachelor is red pilled/a pick-up artist. brendon isn't even a bachelor at this point? but this song is legit so stupid it is funny and at least just "bad mid".

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): my least favorite Shrek movie! at the Disco

**apatel27** (3): Sett Macfarlane sounding ass

**plastichaxan** (2): The bachelor is so lucky he didn’t get to listen to this song

**Uberpigeon** (2): for someone whos dead ur doing a lot of singing brendan

**bogo** (1): someone desperately needs to tell brendon that his vocal range is not as good as he thinks it is

**flava** (1): I’m not enjoying these thudding choruses that just give me a headache

**Hulnia** (1): why does he sound like micheal buble on this one

**jay** (1): im not gagging

**CrimsonROSET** (0): who let him falsetto again

**frogaranaman** (0): this song sounds like a theater major trying to force out a song for the one person musical they’re writing

**CarlieScion** (11): has there ever been a line harder than ‘im sorry every songs about you’??

**velvet-gloves** (11): this song is that bitch to me, still gets regular play near ten years later (and not just on the fourth of july). i scrolled down to give her my 11 before scoring anything else.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this hook feels like taylor swift wrote it (neutral)

**dreamingpastel** (10): ITWASTHEFOURTHOFJULY

**intheaftermath** (10): A pretty clear standout on the record. It's infectious and fun. A very good time.

**moonagenightmares** (10): SON LUX !!!????????? rating this so high purely because i love lost it to trying so much

**RandomHypnotica** (10): you know, the sufjan song came to mind when I pressed play, but that flute (?) sample is really weirdly sufjan-core, its so absurd but its amazing

**runaway3212** (10): sufjan better watch his gay ass

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): YOU AND I WERE! YOU AND I WERE FIRE! FIRE! FIREWOOORKS!!

**xxipil0ts** (10): : okay but did you know that they sampled son lux? that's so good omg they sampled son lux. wait? you don't know son lux? they got sampled by fall out boy.

**-y-y-y-** (9.5): , the metaphor of fireworks going off too soon reminds me of a "one that got away" relationship in the best way

**BreadlessCrust** (9.5): YOU ARE MY FAVORITE WHAT IFFF

**modulum83** (9.5): this song is CRIPPLINGLY horny like MONUMENTALLY down bad

**CrimsonROSET** (9): best headbanger on the album imo

**whoisValensi** (8.5): Oh hey it's that song Pete Wentz wrote about Mik-\*GUNSHOTS*

**1998tweety** (8): she ate a bit

**musical\_pyn** (8): I can't stand the beginning but the chorus is really great

**TragicKingdom1** (8): ended fadjan stevens

**impla77** (7.7): this isn’t offensive to my ears, which is a rare thing in this rate

**seanderlust** (7.7): fall out boy sufjärbz confirmed!!!! cover casimir pulaski day kings!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this could be a Taylor Swift song if it was unemo’d

**king bestie** (7.5): this is so fun to unironically defend

**TiltControls** (7.5): someone ravedj this with sufjan

**heysoupie** (7.4): at this point in the album, I am exhausted from listening to the impassioned vocals for so long.

**mysario** (7.4): a song I wanna listen to on any other day than the Fourth of July

**daythreeinmiami** (7): This isn’t as annoying

**ScrtSuperhero** (7): - THE TORTURE OF SMALL TALK W SOMEONE YOU USED TO LOVE

**welcome2thejam** (7): Doing America marginally proud

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (6.9): kinda as messy as previous cut novocaine, but i like it more! u2 outsold though

**emayzee** (6.4): these songs are all starting to sound the same to me at this point of the album

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): Sufjan Stevens - [BANG]

**frogaranaman** (6): we’re all gonna die

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the chorus is good but the rest isn’t memorable

**steelstepladder** (6): We're all gonna die

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): like i guess theres nothing particularlly awful about this one but this doesnt impact me at all...that bridge still hits like a truck though

**whatsanillinois** (6): whatever is going on in the background of the chorus kinda rules

**criestotheclicking** (5.2): that son lux record (Lanterns — it’s a great album!) got sampled a lot around this time, huh.

**apatel27** (5): Sufjan outsold

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Can’t imagine why this hasn’t become a holiday staple.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I prefer Christmas

**Stryxen** (5): you can tell they started writing this this song with just a title and no vision of what the rest of it would sound like

**throwaway-7650** (5): this isn't sufjan

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): patrick stump you will never be sufjan stevens

**Awkward\_King** (4): these lyrics are so corny omg i bet this would be so fun to unironically defend

**jay** (4): im really trying to be optimistic with this album but nothing is giving what it takes to win americas next top model

**Uberpigeon** (4): sparks in the sky until we meet the sunrise and see the 4th of july come into bloom

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): baby you’re a firework, come on let your colors burst

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): nearly took my 0

All of the albums in this rate all have killer openers. I think in the past I would've given this a 10 but I cant lie post platform tweet it bothers me how many times on this album tyler is like '😡 this is NOT a hip hop album guys 😡 ' while literally doing rapping or using like faux reagge and I think that ultimately makes me not want to listen to this song much anymore

---

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): were you even on 2015 band tumblr if you didn’t have the first rap verse memorised? Anyway, the drumming on this is fucking phenomenal and in terms of cringe Twenty One Pilots lyrics, you can tune those out here.

**plastichaxan** (11): Why is this kinda cunty I didn’t expect to want to call anyone MOTHER in this rate

**welcome2thejam** (11): There are so many parts here that are "absolutely not" which should say a lot about the rest of the song considering the score I'm giving it. Just the best sounding song in the rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): “This isn’t rap.This isn’t hip hop.” Damn right this is EMO.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ‘death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit’ perhaps best lyric in the rate

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Tyler is a real one for being annoyed at YOLO at that time too

**intheaftermath** (10): this was the song that got my dad to love TOP so much that he bought me surprise concert tickets. Do you know what it takes to get a 40 year old man to listen to his angsty tweenybopper's sad tunes and legitimately enjoy it? Apparently Heavydirtysoul is what it takes

**MassiveThief** (10): A classic.

**pig-serpent** (10): Say what you will about TOP as a whole, if you don't like Josh's drumming you need a covid test.

**Stryxen** (10): smash changed the world everyone remembers where they were

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): why does this sound so quiet?? oh its because i was listening to that fob album just now ok its not the songs fault

**timothy444** (10): Forget Eminem and NF, this is real "real" hip-hop music and it's not even that at all. A great way to start a genre-bending album.

**whoisValensi** (10): Sometimes I have to come back to this song to scratch the dumbest fucking itch in my brain and it is that fucking bassline. Like... yeah I won't get into the lyrics or Tyler as a whole (remember the platform tweet... I know you do) but like ughhhhhhhhhh there's something about the whole melody of this song that is just, lighting in a bottle for the lil fly in my brain. [Also super unrelated but related sidenote, FUCK YOLO WORST FIOE SINGLE]

**mysario** (9.9): massive bop and great album opener but I'm taking off 0.1 because I wrote something like the first verse back in high school which either says something about my writing skills or theirs

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): oh i’ve heard this one before (i went to a TOP concert very last minute because my roommate begged me to come with her since her plus one cancelled) (also i have a feeling i’m gonna be saying this a lot)

**emayzee** (9.7): i wanted absolutely nothing to do with this band but i heard this song used in a vine edit for a show i didn't even watch and that ended up being a gateway

**starlitsuns** (9.5): brb entering Trench mode at the end of this music video

**-y-y-y-** (9): , -1 point for a distinct lack of rap and/or hip-hop

**Awkward\_King** (9): best white rapper since *checks notes* macklemore

**dreamingpastel** (9): Good soup.

**seanderlust** (9): say what you want about TOP but if "death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit" goes pretty hard as a line

**TiltControls** (9): the rapid fire verses go a long way for helping what I usually think is the weakest part of TOP songs. Though the prechorus is pretty eh everything else is great

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Kinda embarrassed to give this so high of a score cause that "gangsters don't cry" part is so bad…. but the chorus is so good!!!

**xxipil0ts** (9): : this was the emo litmus test. if you can't rap it, you're banned from hot topic.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): he slayed that fr

**nick1372** (8.5): great sound brought down by a few odd lyrics (gangsters don't cry?)

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): theresaninfestationinmymindsimagination

**Bandito21Dema** (8): because rap

**frogaranaman** (8): weird way to beg for sex but okay

**king bestie** (8): yeah i’m into rap

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Eminem for 8 year olds

**runaway3212** (7.5): I hate when people who are rapping are like "im not rapping im singing with a focus on rhythm over music over melody" like bestie I hate to tell you this

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): the verses were so fucking amazing and then the chorus happened

**bogo** (7): "this is not rap this is not hip hop" :surejan:

**BreadlessCrust** (7): banger

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Hm okay I can tell we’re in for a ride here.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i really want to like this because its such a bop but these lyrics are the worst and thats in a twenty one pilots album 💀

**isthesweetestcon** (7): tbh i have never listened to top, they were after my emo heyday, but this is a solid opening

**jay** (7): WOAHHHHHHHH PUMP THE BREAKS IGGY

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ok this chorus is actually like…really fucking good…but those rap verses man…

**Uberpigeon** (7): im so happy to hear a synth

**ScrtSuperhero** (6.5): - the whiplash of the lines "Gangster's dont cry therefore I'm Mr.Misty-eyed" and "Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit" being on the same song

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): a good hook that’s hurt badly by tyler’s goober rapping just not working here

**1998tweety** (6): the chorus bops but idk about the verses

**daythreeinmiami** (6): Full disclaimer I’ve seen Twenty One Pilots live 3 times and Blurryface was one of my favourite albums of 2015. This is a killer of an opener and when Tyler screams the outro I feel it in my heavydirtysoul.

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (6): the car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel. we're trapped in the belly of this white hip hop beast, but that BRO is HULKING on those pigskins!

**whatsanillinois** (6): dudes playing drums on the back of a truck is very funny

**criestotheclicking** (5.8): “this is not rap this is not hip-hop” hmm but it is literally a rap song. Tyler seems to think he is above rap as a genre despite being heavily influenced by it. You are arguably a better rapper than you are a singer, Tyler… don’t run from it. I like the breakbeat. Sometimes I think Josh is too good for twenty one pilots lmfao

**modulum83** (5.7): my favorite hip hop artists you ask? why, that’s easy - 21 pilots, nf, eminem, macklemore and logic but only 50% of the time

**apatel27** (5): hope rudimental got royalties for this

**followingfreeways** (5): this sounds like 3 different songs in one and i only like one of them

**throwaway-7650** (4.9): I'd 11 this instrumental, unfortuantely tyler joseph speaks

**moonagenightmares** (4): this is like 4 songs stitched into 1 and im not a fan of any of them

**velvet-gloves** (4): the #notlikeotherrappers schtick is annoying

**akanewasright** (3): okay so I know this is a frontrunner, and I get why - it’s frenetic and wild, and basically exactly how you wanna open an album. But… I can’t give this a good score. Something about… nearly everything Tyler says and does on this song feels horribly wrong.

**CarlieScion** (3): mindless zombies walking around… saying stuff like YOLO? Okay mr. im not like other girls

**musical\_pyn** (3): whenever I listen to this I think of a friend who loved this song and then would make fun of me for listening to pop music because it wasn't "real music"

**Hulnia** (1): this is just an nf/modern eminem song

I mean talk about an opener. I just know some of yall are gonna be mad the demi version isnt here and tbh if i wasnt hosting this rate i'd be kinda mad too but because I am hosting, I already know that version is gonna outsell half of the stuff here so im not adding it in, but this song is still a 10!

---

**1998tweety** (11): the Demi remix >>>> but whew this goes off

**apatel27** (11): Kinda a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): idc the demi lovato remix is actually good

**pig-serpent** (10): The most epic sounding Fall Out Boy has ever been with some of their best lyricism.

**runaway3212** (10): this is so fucking good im so what

**starlitsuns** (10): rating this solely based on the remix with Demi Lovato okay thanks

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'll give this a 10 to inflate my average. yass demi. do ricki's ex-acts rate!

**velvet-gloves** (10): love the horn, the tempo of the lyrics, demi’s vocals on the single version elevates it even further (though it would then lose half a point for her pronunciation of mon cheri)

**BreadlessCrust** (9.5): THE BRASS and the BRIDGE omgg

**timothy444** (9.5): In a strange way, I lthink the original is both better and worse than the collaborative version with Demi Lovato. For starters, the mixing here is way more intense, rocky and filled with more energy but at the same time, some of the lyrics that Patrick Treestump tries to deliver feels kinda flat and honestly makes me think that this was written with a collaboration in mind. That said, it's still a solid pop rock banger.

**mysario** (9.2): it would be an 11 if it was the Demi version but alas

**indie\_fan\_** (9.1): you know what woulda made me give this a te-[SLAP]

**flava** (9): this song has too many remixes when all that was needed was the demi remix, even the original doesnt need to exist

**lordofthpotat0** (9): is 11 w demi

**whoisValensi** (9): IT'S IRRESISTIMBULLLLLLLLL ULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL YEAH! Never change Patrick pls.

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): pete wentz said i HAVE to open this album with a masochist anthem or else

**bigbigbee** (8.5): omg trumpets yaay anti-tomato anti-tomato

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): the Demi version is a 0 btw

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): the way the lyrics in this song use mon cheri which would imply the subject matter in this song is a man...diversity win! the fall out boy song about an abusive relationship is mlm

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): does “you look so Seattle but you feel so LA” just mean she’s a nerd with big tits

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): I know that this is gonna get said a million times, but the Demi Lovato remix is perfection.

**emoforever1927** (8): i love patricks vocal force on this song

**king bestie** (8): only Patrick stump could sing the word bubble with so much aggression and get away with it

**ktajlili** (8): This is soooo classic FOB. Over-the-top lyrics, explosive sounds, epic chorus. This is a great intro track.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): version with Demi >>>

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh hell yeah I know those horns and those oh's, this is a certified ESPN Classic

**-y-y-y-** (7.5): , album version is really explosive and the version with Demi is even better, minus points for not knowing how to pronounce mon chérie

**intheaftermath** (7.5): this song could be a 10 if the production was a bit less subdued

**modulum83** (7.5): he’s got bars ngl he’s spitting he’s flowing he’s floating on that beat

**TiltControls** (7.5): Solid opener

**bogo** (7): tbh i think this was my first time listening to the regular version and the way patrick sings mon cheri on the bridge is kinda cursed. not bad though

**CarlieScion** (7): “baby, I’m talking no inflation”; me in 2016 filtering out ao3 fic tags

**CrimsonROSET** (7): patrick is literally the only person in the world who thinks fall out boy are irresistible

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is if an AI made a FOB song with all the quirks

**nick1372** (7): perfect trailer music and nothing else. we don't talk about the demi lovato remix.

**Puppy\_Basket** (7): pretty hype

**ScrtSuperhero** (7): - this track misses something without Demi

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It sounds a bit empty without Demi Lovato screaming over everything but still not bad

**isthesweetestcon** (6.5): the remix is better

**criestotheclicking** (6): the horn riff is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. I can’t imagine this is a very fun song to sing. I guess this album is analogous to DoaB in a way in that both bands are going full mainstream? I guess TWTL; TRTD/DoaB for PATD and SRAR/ABAS for FOB are similar in that they’re transitional periods and yes I did try and abbreviate everything I possibly could there

**frogaranaman** (6): this is the middle ground between "red blooded American who listens to NFL walk out music" and "blue blooded Tumblr user looking to get back at their parents by hitting post limit"

**nt96** (6): If looking so Seattle is seen as derogatory, then is being remotely anything like Florida considered a slur? Yes.

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): sure

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (6): cornball-ass video with a band kid ass aesthetic. endearing next level mid!

**xxipil0ts** (6): : this was gonna be lower but "you look so seattle, but you feel so L.A." is such a bar even if im not from the US so idk what this means but extra points bc of that

**heysoupie** (5.6): the gang vocals at the beginning are obnoxious

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Oh I can resist this just fine.

**jay** (5): :/

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): meh

**impla77** (4.6): not a great first impression

**daythreeinmiami** (4): Oh my god Fall Out Boy and Panic! At the Disco (Brandon Urie) sound the same in this era. The dramatic choruses were really the rage with these guys back in the mid 2010’s. I’m already feeling like I’m not going to like this album. Lorde give me strength through this.

**dreamingpastel** (4): It's alright, I guess.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): “I love the way you hurt me” fans of this song talking about what it does to their ears

**Uberpigeon** (4): i forgot to score this so ill just guess what i probably gave it

**Awkward\_King** (3): patrick stump has such an iconic voice but why does it sound like that

**Bandito21Dema** (3): not my fav

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): why does this song have a drop. why does it sound so bad in general

To my suprise, this was the first stable winner in the rate. Like the ballots were comming in and everything was shifting but this song stayed in first for at least two weeks. There was a particular one two three punch of lowest averages that sealed its fate and locked it out but I would've gladly welcomed the universe this one 

---

**Puppy\_Basket** (11): all time classic, well done

**TiltControls** (11): https://i.imgur.com/ONUuskC.jpg also this comparison is going to sound really cursed but does the first 5 seconds of the whistle follow the same tune as the bridge from dover beach

**xxipil0ts** (11): : they peaked here. nowhere else. idc if i lose bc of this but this is a hill i'll die on.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): I really wouldn’t expect FOB to be a band that crushes a slow song, but here we are.

**CarlieScion** (10): :pensive:

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song was too good for me to have wasted it on anniversary playlist for my ex in 2017... anyways

**IIIHenryIII** (10): definitely not the ones from this generation, sigh

**modulum83** (10): each one of these albums has a moment where the band drops the dumb shit and magically manifests a song of devastating emotional impact and profound meaning where all the songwriting decisions just go right. this is the one.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i could trauma dump about mental illness or i could share a vaguely uncomfortable story about what i associate this song with but i will instead do neither and simply say that this song slays and im gonna be sad when it inevitably leaves in day 1 [**Host Note** : This song was never in day one and in fact when you submitted it was winning]

**throwaway-7650** (10): what do you have to say about this @ chloe x halle

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): this would’ve worked so well as a closer

**velvet-gloves** (9.5): the nostalgia! the wistfulness! the resignedness!

**LilacDaffodils** (9): what being thirteen sounds like

**pig-serpent** (9): FOB > The Who > The Offspring >>> Bad Religion

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): High school me almost teared up listening to this song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): gen z is kinda fucked up :noitssad:

**BreadlessCrust** (8.8): i AM emotionally connected to FOB

**-y-y-y-** (8.5): , poignant, nostalgic, tasteful, a great retrospective with some A++ Patrick vocals to top it off

**akanewasright** (8.5): the verses and prechorus especially rule

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): chloe x halle rate please

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): hm okay I actually like this one, Idk what that shiny metallic sounding thingy is but it’s cool

**isthesweetestcon** (8.5): this one has some soul.

**king bestie** (8.5): such an emo concept sung in such a non emo way

**seanderlust** (8.5): "sometimes i just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes" well bestie do i have a musical genre for you!

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): the existence of an Azealia Banks version of this song…. this says a lot about our society

**runaway3212** (8): Fall Out Boy makes music I would like if I was cooler

**ScrtSuperhero** (8): - the nostalgia, the yearning, lyrically this just HITS, something in this song makes me FEEL

**timothy444** (8): It's interesting how when Fall Out Boy isn't stuck with trash lyrics and over-the-top rockiness that they can create a decent song. Not surprised it flopped tho

**untitledmanuscript** (8): the (tumblr) kids aren't alright

**whoisValensi** (8): But I thought the kids were from yesterday????? So now they aren't alright either??????? Got it.

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (7.8): my favourite so far

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I’ll be honest this score might be a little inflated just for coming after Centuries.

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**CrimsonROSET** (7): chloe x halle outsold

**dreamingpastel** (7): Song that sounds like it's in every teen coming-of-age movie (affectionate)

**impla77** (7): but this is alright

**jay** (7): chorus is cute

**Uberpigeon** (7): peppa pig

**criestotheclicking** (6.5): if not for the overblown drums on here this would be higher. A nice stadium-filler type song.

**starlitsuns** (6.4): to me the instrumental is louder than the vocals on a large portion of this track… not sure if intentional but it slightly kills an otherwise alright song

**bigbigbee** (6): I love a jaunty little whistle moment. Fall Out Boy are now in the good company of such music legends as Black Pink, Flo Rida, the soundtrack to Monty Python Life of Brian,

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I mean relatable I am indeed not alright but I’m also not emo enough for this song

**intheaftermath** (6): ok it's not incredible but it made me feel cool in middle school

**moonagenightmares** (6): its a song ig

**welcome2thejam** (6): Noooo you've invoked shoegaze and the Offspring simultaneously what have you done

**heysoupie** (5.6): are these lyrics deep or..?

**nt96** (5): ugh whistles

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): if 21p produced this it could've been a good song

**whatsanillinois** (5): would've preferred a who cover but it's okay

**daythreeinmiami** (4.7): Actually, according to Chloe and Halle and my top song of 2018, the kids are alright.

**flava** (4): sounds like it belongs in the suicide squad section of the rate (derogatory)

**frogaranaman** (4): they would be if this song was not boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): snoozer i fear

**Stryxen** (3.5): the percussion is so weird and like lethargic this song isn’t terrible tho, just the chorus

**apatel27** (3): The worst tropes of mid 2010's mens pop mixed

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (3): the kids are being handed the most limp wrist instrumental on the album that sorta just sleepwalks its anthemic shit to the end

**bogo** (1): this makes me want to vomit

THERES A ROOM IN A HOTEL IN NEW YOR CITY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Hearing this song as we were approaching a hotel in new york city,,, i was living. This song is so fucking good!!! I hope it wins

Okay well it didnt win BUT IT MADE TOP 5 AND I COUNT THAT AS A WIN IN MY BOOKS !!!!! 

---

**-y-y-y-** (11): , absolute 11, I am the jet black crow droning on and on and on when it comes to how good this song is

**indie\_fan\_** (11): i have nothing witty to say here, this is just fantastic

**isthesweetestcon** (11): it has the production of new emo, and not quite the lyrics of the older songs but it has some of the heart, either way i fw the imagery and theme here and the music does it justice

**whoisValensi** (11): What to say about the best FOB song to ever song... Oh jesus... First off me giving this 11 you can probably fucking clock I'm an MCR fan cause this is about right on fucking par with 'Mama' as far as ~d r a m a~ goes musically. SECOND OFF, I would do so much shit to listen to this again for the first time. I mean I'm still amazed by the damn song every time but like, oh man... It's really just such a special ass song to me. The way it builds through each verse and then you get into the instrumental breaks with the fucking uhhhh vocalizations and like aaaaaaaaaaaa. I'd like to think if I had any ounce of musical talent I would be using it to spend my every waking minute attempting to come up with a song this fucking good. What a life changer to me. (Also like heavy side note, I would highkey get a tattoo of a few different sets of lyrics in this song even if that's a lil cringy idc)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song seeing me give it a 10 after relentlessly tanking the rest of the album https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A7KrE6fxGVs

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FUCKING PERIOD

**intheaftermath** (10): the fact this entire album doesn't include this darker sound is a crime. This almost feels like a teaser.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Perfect music for driving very very fast and screaming every word at the top of your lungs. No notes

**moonagenightmares** (10): im a sucker for quirked up gospel parts in a song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I kinda wish the pre-chorus delivered into something stronger, but it’s still very slay

**ScrtSuperhero** (10): - 17 year old me formed an unbreakable bond with this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the drum solo...the acapella outro...this is fucking art, maybe the best album closer fall out boy has ever made

**untitledmanuscript** (10): this is one hell of a closer

**BreadlessCrust** (9.9): such a good closing song, such a good song overall <3

**velvet-gloves** (9.8): a deeply cool soundscape

**king bestie** (9.5): i love fall out boy

**Awkward\_King** (9): not rhyming city with pretty was so genius of them

**CarlieScion** (9): horny but make it poetry?

**dreamingpastel** (9): The outro is SO good.

**frogaranaman** (9): those are expensive

**nick1372** (9): loving the incredibly blunt symbolism going on here

**TiltControls** (9): This is growing on me more with every listen.

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): this sounds like it would be performed at The Game Awards

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): FOR FUCK’S SAKE, PEOPLE. NOT EVERYTHING WITH AN S IS POSSESSIVE.

**pig-serpent** (8): I loved this when it first came out, but man that instrumental is just, lacking something and it's lost my interest over the years.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This has no reason to be as big a banger as it is

**welcome2thejam** (8): I would like to stay a night in the Skeleton Hotel pls

**heysoupie** (7.9): In sum, I’m ready to admit I miss the old FOB; this one comes kinda close.

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**CrimsonROSET** (7): we open with la end with nyc, if we had a vegas mention we’d get bingo

**modulum83** (7): the apostrophe is driving me NUTS if you have a typo in your song title i fucking hate you

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the grammatical error in the title annoys me

**runaway3212** (6): this is lowkey boring

**starlitsuns** (6): "twin skeletons" wow literally sounds like Twenty One Pilots lore

**bigbigbee** (5.5): that little apostrophe is unholy

**daythreeinmiami** (5): Yeah it’s fine I guess. It can go on my Halloween playlist, maybe.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): meh?

**lordofthpotat0** (5): another fob song another bunch of nonsense lyrics

**xxipil0ts** (5): : why did they close the album with this?

**criestotheclicking** (4.9): I never looked at the title of this song properly so I always thought it was like a live bonus track from a NYC hotel. Cool ending but not enough to make me like the song.

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): the enunciation in this one is interesting, because I thought I heard “she smells our feet” instead of “she shares our fate”

**whatsanillinois** (4): not an awful album! much better than i thought

**Bandito21Dema** (3): feels like a filler

**emoforever1927** (3): love the story/lyrics of this song just not the sound and composure of the song

**jay** (3): "theres a room in a hotel in new york city" will be the next single for lanas album

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (3): we are sleepwalking to the end of this album. why do i wanna go visit a skelly in a hotel in nyc? im only going there to make some bullish trades on wall street!

This being the last 21p deep cup in puzzles me so much because I do not enjoy and I thought for sure it would be out and well, I guess i misscalculated

---

**bogo** (11): yeah this is the "emo" banger to end all "emo" bangers. 21p should just abandon the conceptual stuff and drop a dance record it would slay

**starlitsuns** (11): as someone who lives in a place a lot smaller than Columbus, Ohio, this hits quite beautifully. like sure, there's sunlight and people here but it's very boring and stale, kinda like Columbus, Ohio.

**Stryxen** (11): the only good xx song

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): synthpøp bøp frøm tøp

**throwaway-7650** (11): YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN... SOMEBODY'S GONNA CRY4U

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): They live in cities…we’ll never see on screen??

**CrimsonROSET** (10): (tyler joseph is from columbus, ohio)

**darj** (10): this is a legit amazing song

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This song just is a vibe listening to it when I’m driving around my city at night. Just straight vibes.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I HATED my hometown as a teen so it’s pretty obvious that this song was my jam. Small town Ohio and small town NZ aren’t that different.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Coldplay but make it cool

**modulum83** (10): i don’t know what any of these lyrics mean all i know is that i hear 80s synths and gated drums and i feel like running out into the street at night

**seanderlust** (10): arguably my favorite lyrics on the album

**TiltControls** (10): probably the least emo sounding song of the rate and one of my faves

**velvet-gloves** (10): best song on the album for me

**Bandito21Dema** (9): awesome beat

**emayzee** (9): heard this in a chinese supermarket the other day and it stopped me in my tracks

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): oh WOW those keyboards made me feel nostalgic

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i did not remember like this one as much as i do now

**intheaftermath** (9): vividly remember the TOP fanbase losing their mind after NASA playlisted this for the solar eclipse

**isthesweetestcon** (9): first song on this album i fw enough to add to my playlists

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): disco era 🤩🤩

**welcome2thejam** (9): Immediate context clues pointing to their hometown being Alaska

**criestotheclicking** (8.8): a spiritual predecessor to My Blood in some ways? One of the better songs even if it doesn’t stand out, I like the guitar riff and the overall chill vibe

**1998tweety** (8.5): hold awn the production on this snaps

**heysoupie** (8.1): wtf !  thought spotify just started autoplaying someone else after the end of this album. Kind of a pleasant surprise. Makes me want to listen to “When Love Takes Over”

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Pretty fun, not much else to say.

**frogaranaman** (8): this feels like a jam made for Sirius XMU

**hikk** (8): a cute little synthpop track is just what i need atp in the album so yass

**musical\_pyn** (8): "twenty one pilots but make it the killers" is a good vibe

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): can't have shit in ohio

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): of course when I hear something suddenly 80’s inspired I like it more

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): twilight ass song

**-y-y-y-** (7): , it's a good song to be in the pit during but it isn't magic to my ears or anything

**nick1372** (7): this is the only song on this album that any other band could've written. I like the vibes but the lyrics are just vaguely religious nothingness.

**bigbigbee** (6.5): blind mole rats be like

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): a cute moment but nothing more

**CarlieScion** (6): the closest they’ve come to trees post-vessel

**impla77** (6): I’m never convinced by the irrelevant hometown narrative

**steelstepladder** (6): It's fine!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): why is this sephora-playlistcore

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It sounds not bad… but I don't get it

**jay** (5): well

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5): straight up forgot this one was on as I was listening in the cue-up. mid!

**whoisValensi** (5): A middle of the road song for me. You'd think I'd relate to it cause my hometown kinda ain't a thing really but like ehhhh. In one ear, out the other.

**dreamingpastel** (4): I could put this on in the background while doing other things and have no problem with it.

**runaway3212** (4): a bit boring

**akanewasright** (1): This is kinda serving “shitty early Marina deep cut”

And here we sadly part ways with my beloved fall out boy </3 This song actually never hit first place but was fighting for second place for a while before other songs slowly started creeping up and giving it a run for its money. At one point this song was out 4th below hometown and that truly was a terrible timeline. As the extensions came in and gave it low scores it sealed its faith in 3rd and I came to accept that fob rate winner was a dream of the past

---

**nt96** (11): I literally have not heard this since it came out and when I say the very millisecond this song started, I was violently thrusted back to 2015, it was senior year and I had to take the bus to work because I didn't have my license yet. This really took me back to those hot summer days when I became VERY enthralled with writing, and I took a heavy interest in cinema, being very inspired by Tarantino in particular and like many others in their teens, didn’t have a care in the world and your dreams really did felt like they were so close, you could touch it. This song satisfied the teenaged, artsy, movie-lover in me, one that I've buried for so long. This was truly a welcome back party wrapped in a 3 minute song. Thx Roxie for the memories!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i don't think im exagerating when i say that this song shaped me as a person...when i was on tumblr at the tender young age of 13 and saw an edit that had this song in it? my god it was one of the best songs i had ever heard in my life, i was obsessed with it as much as an autistic 13 year old tumblr user could possibly be. granted, this was all before i became aware of the fact that this samples the munsters theme, but honestly? i couldnt care less, that silly sample makes this song all the more better, a killer riff being incorporated in a song referencing a movie more than 25 years old should hit this well but it does. it helps that i was already a fan of fall out boys previous big singles too, but none of them shook me to my core immediately like this one did and still does. maybe its just nostalgia speaking, but this is one of my favorite songs of all time, i can't imagine what my life would be like without this song in it

**Awkward\_King** (10): SHE WANTS TO DANCE LIKE MAYA HAWKE

**CrimsonROSET** (10): /checks notes THE MUNSTERS?!

**dreamingpastel** (10): Now THIS is an earworm.

**flava** (10): when this wins with a 10+ average

**hikk** (10): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fi5Xb7BWIAg-cTc?format=jpg&name=medium

**ignitethephoenix** (10): still disappointed Uma Thurman wasn’t in the video

**IIIHenryIII** (10): is it bad that I only know who she is due to Kill Bill?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this fucking **HIT SONG** ended fadnic at the disco

**mysario** (10): insert dancing gif here

**pig-serpent** (10): When the album came out, I immediately pegged this song as the best one and wondered why it wasn't a huge single.  A few months later, it was, and it was vindicating. Getting those hipster points I was supposed to get by Rainbowdragoneyes blowing up.

**seanderlust** (10): winona ryder being dragged into FOB's explanation of this song: https://i.redd.it/afidj1z9hwf81.jpg

**starlitsuns** (10): :clapping: SHE WANTS TO DANCE LIKE UMA THERMAN BURY ME UNTIL I CONFESS :clapping:

**timothy444** (10): One of the most funnest uses of a TV show sample I've heard in a mainstream pop punk song and love how the topic of this song is basically comparing some woman with Uma Thurman and it hits really hard!

**velvet-gloves** (10): the most delightfully weird choice of sample, in an even more delightful juxtaposition to the pulp fiction allusion of the lyrics and staging.

**whoisValensi** (9.5): Hi my name is Nick and my dad once stopped this song while it was playing through Pandora on the TV while we were eating dinner one night to explain how it samples/interpolates The Munsters theme and he stuck on it for like 10 minutes it was way too much.

**modulum83** (9.1): i heard this blasting outside a restaurant in washington dc one time and let me tell you it was the most transcendentally lit shit of my life.

**1998tweety** (9): she bops

**Bandito21Dema** (9): because awesome

**CarlieScion** (9): surf rock (complementary)

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): patrick stump put his whole bussy into this song teabh

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): it's like they tried for once to make a good song but please like put some distance between your voice box and microphone

**welcome2thejam** (9): Actually, its correct name is Uma Thurman's Monster

**BreadlessCrust** (8.8): just a little overrated imo

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): https://twitter.com/petewentz/status/545106473052033024

**bigbigbee** (8.5): perfect running BPM, I have jugged many jogs to this song

**intheaftermath** (8.5): when I was a kid I thought "keep you like an oath" was "keep your lichen on" and I thought it was SO cool that Fall Out Boy was singing about a composite organism commonly found in cemeteries

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): how did i know that guitar riff was too good to not be a sample lol

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Not quite as much of a banger as Centuries, but still a banger.

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (8): this is now my favourite

**frogaranaman** (8): why are there so many samples in this rate

**impla77** (8): nice riff!

**isthesweetestcon** (8): it’s the inner tarantino fan in me i can’t help it

**king bestie** (8): my mums favourite which is so valid

**LilacDaffodils** (8): I loved than I hated it but it turns out all I needed was a five year break and now I love it again!

**whatsanillinois** (8): kinda bangs??

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): Halsey was referencing this song on killing boys

**plastichaxan** (7.5): This kinda makes no sense but I support them

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (7.5): this one was COOKING with that munsters sample, surf gtr, and glitzy keys.

**emayzee** (7.3): when this came out i had no idea who uma thurman was and i just assumed she was an old hollywood actress from the 1940s or something

**runaway3212** (7): this super random reference that makes no sense but I yass over anyway

**TiltControls** (7): hello i'd like to order one kill bill by SZA as the interlude please?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This was never my favorite tbh

**criestotheclicking** (6.9): The Munsters sample kind of carries here. Another song that overstays its welcome, and that also has unnecessary hand-claps and vocal samples.

**-y-y-y-** (6.5): , kinda lacks what Centuries has in staying power but still holds on really nicely

**daythreeinmiami** (6): My husband loves this song and his dancing to it is so adorable I have to give it a slightly above average score. That’s called dedication to my marriage.

**ScrtSuperhero** (6): - the stench of summer sex and CK eternity oh hell yes. Come on man. What the hell is that

**heysoupie** (5.1): another iconic riff rip? And interpolation of Gaga’s Applause, too? This song just doesn’t sit well with me. Maybe also because Pulp Fiction is such a (male) pick me move lmao

Roxieloxie:  
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The Munsters are doing so much heavy lifting here and even they could only do so much.

**nick1372** (5): *SNIFF* the stench....

**jay** (4): dont name drop my grandmother like this when you dont know her like that. Thank you

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): this and Centuries were the only songs from this album that I’d heard before this rate. This song is kind of a mess, I’m not surprised that it didn’t make me want to find out more about Fall Out Boy lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (2.5): No disrespect to anyone who likes this but it feels like it’s appropriating douchebag culture.

**bogo** (2): they repeat the chorus way too often and it's insanely annoying, the verses should be like double the length they are

**MassiveThief** (2): Just always got annoyed when this came on. Sample is overbearing.

**Uberpigeon** (2): fart trumpets

**TheQueenofVultures** (1.5): I was a camp counselor the summer this was popular, and this got them so excited… made me want to drown them

**Hulnia** (1): this is also just a one direction song

**Stryxen** (1): so icky…they threw everything at this song and only the grossest slimiest stuff stuck

**krusso1105** (9.545): Yes, I'm aware this is embarrassingly high and my highest rate average ever.

**whoisValensi** (9.409): The only funfact you need to know about me is that I share my birthday with Patrick Stump.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.318): I came into this rate expecting to stan FOB, and while I wasn’t a hater of the other two albums, this one is still by far the most consistent and absolutely infectious.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.000): disclaimer that a) i was the world biggest fall out boy stan in 2017-2018, so i may be a little bit biased about this album, and b) im also a hardcore mania defender, so maybe im not the best person to talk to when it comes to music takes, but when i was younger i used to think this was fob's worst album by a pretty decent margin, not a bad album by any means, but considering they had a near flawless 4 album run from futct to srar, this album felt like a pretty big drop off comparitively. but revisiting it now, 4 years later and after i hadnt listened to most of these songs in 3+ years? honestly i'm SHOCKED i ever considered this to be their weakest work, it holds up amazing well as a pop rock record and some of fob's best ever songs are on here. twin skeletons, novocaine, the title track, and lets not forget uma thurman, one of my favorite songs of all time and one that pratically changed me as a person, even the weaker songs arent awful and work in the context of the album. this album and fall out boy as a whole mean a lot to me and im glad that this rate gave me the inititive to revisit this album and fall in love with it all over again.

**cremeebrulee** (8.900): STOP DOING FOB DIRTY IN EMO RATES!!!!!! WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS ALBUM IS GONNA FLOP AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

**DakotaTheFolfyBoi** (8.818): My favorite of these three albums.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.545): Okay so when I said in the announcement thread that this was one of my least favorite FOB albums I was fucking lying. I guess I thought that maybe it wouldn't age well or I just wouldn't like it as much as I did years ago, but no, it's still the one. This is the album that got me into music. Everyone has one, this is mine. As late as high school, I never really listened to music for "fun," just took in whatever my parents played on the radio. But hearing the raw anger and passion of Fall Out Boy awoke something in me. Funny to say, I know, since they're not exactly the most critically-acclaimed band, but to me that didn't matter. They made me feel good, and I always heard that music is supposed to make you feel good, and now I got to experience that feeling in a whole new light. Years later, here I am, fully immersed in popular music culture and doing meaningless rates on obscure pop music-themed internet forums, all because of that moment, not too long ago, that I heard Patrick Stump's voice and thought it was sexy as hell.

**modulum83** (8.291): this is the one album that i believe genuinely holds up. like DOAB, it is literally just summer party music. but this is the kind of summer soundtrack that feels like it lasts nostalgically past its years. fall out boy knows their way around a monstrously anthemic hook and the sense of bittersweetness that its counterparts lack. when it comes to just crafting pop music, this is by far the tightest and most consistent one. it fulfills the mission of arena rock while being true to the angsty rot of suburbia. this held up a lot better than i thought it would.

**timothy444** (8.227): There are some bangers in here but looking back now, I have mixed opinions on theming this album on America. I guess it works for the most part tho and it's way better than the rap version of this album or their next album MANIA.

**nick1372** (8.045): FOB's best album, and by a sizable margin. Sure, it's basic, it's barely pop punk, it's corny as hell. But it's not watered down. Instead they turn the melodrama up to 11 and it's glorious. Well except when it's boring (on the two hits from the album...).

**pig-serpent** (7.727): Great album, and easily the best post hiatus FOB album, and their 3rd best overall.  I understand thinking some parts of the album sound a little bland, but this crams so many hooks into every moment possible.  If HPM (hooks per minute) was a form of measurement, this album would have one of the highest marks.

**moonagenightmares** (7.518): the frontman is one of the most boring rock band frontmen of all time

**TiltControls** (7.455): I was a little worried for this one since I didn't really like the singles I'd heard from it on the radio, but then it turns out it was really good otherwise??? Those 2 ended up being my lowest scores for the album anyways too. Glad to see FOB is still around and kicking

**IIIHenryIII** (7.318): this rate actually made this album grow on me a bit more, which is kinda surprising because I didn't care that much about it back when it was released. Except for the singles and a couple tracks, I despised the rest of the tracks. Each day I learn I was kind of a dumbass in my teens.

**hikk** (7.091): i don't care for a lot of post-hiatus fob, i don't really hate any of it but it's just fairly middling for me. still a couple smashes here tho

**throwaway-7650** (6.955): I think FOB should make a shoegaze album I think I would enjoy it if I can't hear the vocals clearly

**xxipil0ts** (6.827): actually not half as cheesy as i remembered it to be. 15-year-old me had TASTE!

**welcome2thejam** (6.545): If we ever do an emo rate with Cork Tree, I can promise you much stronger scores. As is, everything kinda just feels a bit too much for me; not offensively bad though outside of one son, easily the most consistent. Sports ad break commercial core songs total: 10/11, they were the kings of this genre for the time period, probably at the peak of their powers here

**celladonn** (6.500): I never got into this album as much as the other two here, I definitely felt like it was a step down from Save Rock And Roll (which was a step down from Folie)

**MassiveThief** (6.364): Surprised at how much I ended up liking this bc of how much I hate Centuries/Uma Thurman.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.136): similar to panic, i’m a fob fan but this album was the beginning of the end i fear. also save rock and roll is their best album btw i said what i said

**frogaranaman** (6.091): they slayed with the single choices at least

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.627): Fall Out Boy may actually be woke? or are they just another example of radio ready anthemic postmodern anonymity? so much of this album COULD be theoretically great, but in all honesty, it's like 4 pretty decent singles and a ton of bland radio ready deep cuts to stretch your arms towards the heavens for. it's not an album that warrants much conversation or actual attachment, because it is just next level mid. it's safe and coherent, but boring. tragically, it doesn't have a message about the dangers of incel communities or 4chan, and includes arguably some of the most fash album artwork of the 2010s writ large; a result of failing to critique its own image there (it was bad album art 7 years ago and its only worse now). i was REALLY hoping FOB had something to say about white masculinity on this album. they DON'T! they just vibe. REAL emo would!

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.409): I wasn’t huge on FOB as a kid, so unfortunately this lacks the nostalgia bump the other two have. Listening to it for the first time, I can safely say that neither me now or me at 15 would have been huge on this, so at least I don’t have to worry about ‘not getting’ something I would’ve loved as a kid.

**TheQueenofVultures** (5.318): we can’t be 15 forever thankfully

**Stryxen** (5.182): okaayyy miss boy

**bogo** (3.273): to be quite honest i don't think i've ever really cared for this album, not even when i was 14. the only fob album i ever listened to was folie a deux, which i liked a lot because it had a lot of personality and patrick's singing on that album in my opinion was really good. neither of those things are true for this album, it is one of the most lifeless, uninspired albums i have ever heard and patrick sounds like the fourth member of alvin and the chipmunks on it. like i bullied the fuck out of death of a bachelor but at least brendon elicited some sort of emotion out of me, this album on the other hand just makes me feel completely dull and empty

Man, this song put me fucking through it. I did not consider it a winner contender, nor did it really put up a fight for one at first. It was chilling in the bottom of the top 10 for a while until one day I noticed that it clawed its way into 1st after the other two got some tankings. At the time it was kinda funny because LA Devotee had the most 11s in the rate and yet that couldnt beat this song that had a single 11 by CrimsonRoset. and then we had what i call 'the january 6th coup' I dont know if all the top stans cordinated but overnight this song seemed to have completly overdone the top 3 and the gap was growing larger and larger until quite litterally the very end. The last 3 ballots i got switched the ordering of the top 2 like 5 times but in the end it lost.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): https://tenor.com/view/nyango-star-no-stick-nyango-starr-no-stick-nyango-star-hand-drum-nyango-starr-hand-drum-gif-12986703

**emayzee** (11): this peaking at #82 on the hot 100 when heathens peaked at #2? we live in a society

**musical\_pyn** (11): "but my taste in music is your FACE" lyric of the century idc idc

**steelstepladder** (11): The bridge throws this song into true greatness

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): this is the only song from this rate I might but on willingly

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this song has plenty of flaws but it's also the only song where i feel like all of their twentyonepilotisms come together in a fully satisfying and triumphant way

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (11): oh my god. irrational "okay you guys did it" 11 goes to Tear in My Heart. this one legitimately comes together in a way that's aching to be on the radio in 2005 alongside MCR. it's not bad in any way! It's also not puddle of mudd - blurry,, but jesus these kids are so cornball earnest and nailing a blissful sound that I can't help but cheer for them. like i jumped for joy at this song I can't believe how much it makes me smile. GOOD WORK GANG I'LL TAKE A WHOLE ALBUM OF THIS!!!

**1998tweety** (10): devoured

**Awkward\_King** (10): BUT MY TASTE IN MUSIC IS YOUR FACE!

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): Verily, mine own gust in music is thy visage.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It’s nice to hear a straight up love song and not lyrics I would need to read 20 pages to understand.

**CarlieScion** (10): sometimes men can make good songs about women ig

**celladonn** (10): just a really great pop song

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): the “loves Tear in My Heart” to koreaboo pipeline.

**flava** (10): a synth melody straight from tumblr heaven

**frogaranaman** (10): “but my taste in music is your FACE!” yea he deserved to get bullied for that line

**hikk** (10): the chorus synths make me emotional fr at least there's One song i like on this album

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this definitely encapsulates emo pop, like this is the soft song but also we got to describe her as a butcher

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is the most romantic song ever, I mean, it doesn't get sweeter than cursing the government for the holes in the street my wake your asleep partner in your car

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fun fact: I we once had to do lip sync project for Animation class in high school and this was the song I chose to animate a clip of for my project. Specifically, it was the “you fell asleep in my car” part. it was a serve to 16 year old me

**nick1372** (10): pop perfection. that being said what the fuck is this music video

**poemforsmallthings** (10): them shouting annyeonghaseyo in the beginning just kills me like your wife was born in Ohio

**seanderlust** (10): this song is intrinsically tied to the parks and rec ron swanson gifset that was popular on tumblr if you know you know. anyways this is still a very lovely song

**starlitsuns** (10): this is arguably one of like, maybe 5 whole songs in TØP's discography that musically sounds positive and it is a whole euphoric vibe

**Stryxen** (10): even gabbie hanna was gagging

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): best of the Tyler wanted to be cute tracks. The ones on Trench were stinky

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): koreaboos

**welcome2thejam** (10): Y'all know I'm a sucker for a chorus that soars, and oh baby does this fly over each and every unfilled pothole

**criestotheclicking** (9): probably the best song on this album. Just a synth-pop-rock tune about loving your wife.

**emoforever1927** (9): love this so much! you can hear his love in this song and I love the lyrics and sound

**Hulnia** (9): would’ve been a 10 if the lyrics weren’t noticeably awful. usually i don’t mind but they really stand out here lol

**king bestie** (9): if you’re really bad at avoiding pot holes does it make you a poser

**velvet-gloves** (9): a bop.

**whatsanillinois** (9): i disagree. potholes are the least of our concern but i get the sentiment

**mysario** (8.7): I didn't realize how big this song was until it was on a Heardle one day

**bigbigbee** (8.5): honestly, TOP have a gift for making lyrics that are a bit silly sound honest, heartfelt, and sweet

**daythreeinmiami** (8.5): This is the song that made take note of Twenty One Pilots. Before this song I just used to see them as the band that Debby Ryan was dating the drummer of. But this song literally is serotonin to my ears.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Some cringey lines and moments but overall I really like this one, that piano is such a good engine for the song and the electronic elements layered on in the second half give it a lot of build.

**jay** (8): ? JKNDJKEWNKJGFNJ THE INTRO i was like woah did my korean 101 audiobook start playing

**MassiveThief** (8): The lyrics suck. Like bad. But when you ignore them it hits.

**pig-serpent** (8): At the time I was convinced this would be the song they blew up with, and in hindsight I guess I'm glad that it didn't because this is the "song on this record that feels common."  That said, it kinda slaps though.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): this is the 2nd song in a row you’ve talked about the radio, is this 2003

**TiltControls** (8): they really like talking about radios huh

**Uberpigeon** (8): just a goofy little crazy man

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): my guy that’s a ventricular septal defect you should get that checked out

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): i was so sure this would be the big crossover chart hit of the album when it first dropped and then well…. that didn’t quite happen but its still cute

**-y-y-y-** (7): , a bit weak sonically but still super sweet lyrics

**impla77** (7): wow this rate is making me discover the origins of those Tiktok sounds I hate! Thankfully the rest of the song is good actually

**isthesweetestcon** (7): again…. great production and i adore the sound of this, this could be a 9+ song but the lyrics are lacking to me

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): if you think about it, the “annyeonghaseyo” in this song is what kickstarted the emo to kpoppie pipeline

**nt96** (7): the bridge was pretty funny

**timothy444** (7): "My taste in music is your face" is such a nonsensical line like wtf

**BreadlessCrust** (6.7): overrated, cute tho

**bogo** (6): ...is her face shaped like a ukelele or something?

**intheaftermath** (6): the impact this had on 12 year old ukulele girls in 2016 was insane. I was one of them. I know it well

**modulum83** (6): twenty one pilots would like you to know that they too listened to fifa-core festival indie circa 2009 and i will NOT fall for it

**whoisValensi** (6): If someone wrote a song about me and said that their taste in music was my face I would simply pour acid all over my face but that's just me.

=====

Roxieloxie: **heysoupie** (5.8): really hate the EDM synths & the System of a Down but toothless lyrics but i like the “Get What You Give” New Radicals-ish melodies

**throwaway-7650** (5.1): YOU🫵ARE A KOREABOO

**ktajlili** (5): I was surprised when I heard this song on the album. This is the same band that did Stress Out? The versatility of styles is impressive, but I do find the production on this song a bit ugly, even if it catchy. Some of the lyrics are pretty funny. I don't think "my taste in music is your face" is meant to be taken seriously, as they are obivious capable of writing better lyrics.

**runaway3212** (5): just kinda half baked... like his heart HA!

**akanewasright** (4): I’ve heard this a fair amount, and tbh it’s never clicked for me, but it’s *far* from the worst here

**apatel27** (4): needs to be more lofi and swap the drums for more bass

**indie\_fan\_** (2): "The songs on the radio are okay, but my taste in music is your face" sounds like if some white kid in middle school who bullied their crush tried to turn an insult into compliment to show that they actually like them

**dreamingpastel** (1): The synths were a CHOICE.

**followingfreeways** (1): ok

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): proto-tiktok music and i mean that in the most negative way imaginable. whoever told them that the “my taste in music is your face” line was good should never be allowed to produce music again

**xxipil0ts** (1): : i know this is for jenna but pls

**IIIHenryIII** (10.071): Vessel is the album that introduced me to the band and it's hands down my favorite album of all time. Back then, I used to think they couldn't top it, no pun intended, and then Blurryface came out and then I thought they couldn't do it again, and we got Trench. I mean, it's insane how they achieved that. I honestly consider those 3 perfect albums. Anyway, top is my second favorite musical act of all time and I'm just glad we're rating this. I find it so hard to find music I can relate to on a deeper level and with them I have just that.

**emayzee** (9.350): ok fully outing myself here as someone whose all time #1 artist on lastfm is this band. I was graduating high school when they blew up in 2016 and at that time I would have expected myself to become literally anything else in this lifetime before I became a twenty one pilots fan. to me they were the epitome of cringy emo 14 year olds and I was a……non-emo, slightly less cringy (although that's debatable) 18 year old. fast forward a few months and a couple unexpected life roadblocks later, I found myself alone on a train during my first semester of college, randomly decided to listen to vessel, got about halfway through the first track ode to sleep and immediately felt the need to reevaluate every opinion I thought I had about them. somehow, some way, these two boys from ohio that I swore I'd never be a fan of snuck their way into my heart and have remained there ever since. as far as this album goes, it’s a weird one in that it was a commercial powerhouse but chronologically sandwiched between two albums (vessel and trench) that are oftentimes considered objectively better by their stans and music fans in general. and that’s including me-  I always kinda rotated between thinking one of those two was my favorite. it wasn’t until this rate where I had the epiphany of “wait have I just been lying to myself the whole time and blurryface is actually my favorite??” maybe I just have nostalgia blinders on but I hadn’t listened to this album in a while and found this relisten to be so much fun. is it the most groundbreaking, objectively perfect piece of art ever recorded? of course it isn’t, but it sure is an absolutely stacked near-hour of pop banger after pop banger that I can see myself always coming back to. without the success of this album and the following they were able to amass from it they would have never had the resources to be able to express their creativity on the scale that they were always destined to, and the intricately detailed album lore (even if I still can’t fully follow it), mind blowing tours, and last year’s elaborate livestream concert film are just a few testaments to that. after so many years of following them, they’re constantly still impressing me creatively and as a fan it has been an absolute pleasure to witness.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.643): I have watched as many videos on twenty one pilots lore as I have given out 10s here

**flava** (8.571): I am not going to perceive the band Twenty One Pilots, I will not perceive the lore, I will not perceive the baggage this band comes with, I will just perceive the quality of the songs, and most of these songs are pretty good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.107): still side-eyeing Tyler Joseph for having the energy to write Lane Boy and not to speak out against racist police brutality, but I admit this album is mostly good

**steelstepladder** (8.000): Deserves the win

**frogaranaman** (8.000): you know how Taylor Swift fans always build out universes for her albums and read super into all the songs? the same is true for twenty one pilots fans, just arguably a touch less white

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.893): I was convinced this was the best album to ever be conceived back in the day. To this day, I am still convinced that it’s better than Vessel.

**DakotaTheFolfyBoi** (7.714): Probably my least favorite of these three albums. I love TOP's early stuff so much that this is my least listened to album of theirs. Still a very good album though. Love the general sound, just like the other two albums more.

**cremeebrulee** (7.664): who was gonna tell me the tyler and the other guy in TOP weren’t brothers

**celladonn** (7.607): Trench and Vessel/Regional At Best are better than this but it's still a solid listen. Was cool back in the day seeing them become huge off of this album

**ImADudeDuh** (7.571): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/390648593331126273/1055306398239571988/image.png thinking about my twenty one pilots scrobbles over the years

**MassiveThief** (7.536): One of those albums that sucks but is actually good. or something like that. oh and vessel better

**krusso1105** (7.429): Suffered a bit from being the only album in the rate I didn't listen to until just before the rate

**nick1372** (7.321): 21 Pilots deserved so much better than the reputation they were left with over this album. I could blame 'Ride' (that song is awful) but I think people just hated them because of their teen girl fanbase? Ultimately, while Blurryface is flawed, I've never heard an album that sounds exactly like it. Certainly no hip-hop/rock fusion has ever sounded like 21 Pilots and done this sound as well as Blurryface. 21 Pilots always have an artistic vision (something I can't say for the other acts in this rate, despite being fans) and Blurryface is an interesting concept that's executed surprisingly well.

**Stryxen** (7.107): okaayyy miss pilots
[/r/popheads/comments/10isupq/emo_rate_3_rate_reveal_day_3_baby_we_built_this/j5gv3cl/]

=====

Roxieloxie: **modulum83** (6.550): man, i still don’t know what the fuck to do about this album. i really like vessel and trench and even S&I but blurryface just sounds like a frankenstein horror of 2010s monogenre trends smashed into a babbling incoherent form. at times, we get really beautiful songs that sound different from the pack - but other times it’s just kinda head-scratching and directionless. and god, the lyrics are just rough here. sorry, there’s no defending them. josh is a really good drummer though.

**timothy444** (6.500): I absolutely love the first half of this album and each song there feels distinctly different from each other, each covering a slightly different topic. Although I don't like "Ride" as much now, it's still interesting to see how that became such a huge radio hit. Didn't really care too much about the second half though, and it all blurs out as a whole for me. Sadly, they became a one album wonder with this one.

**pig-serpent** (6.500): This has grown off me a good bit since it came out, but it still has a few great songs on it.

**TiltControls** (6.429): I feel like the more I listen to a TOP song the more I begin to dislike it (some exceptions like the songs I scored high), but I remember liking some of these songs when the album first dropped a lot more than I do now

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.393): i was SUCH a big 21p fan when this came out it’s kinda crazy…and this album still holds up thankfully

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (6.329): in the UK if u had a guy rapping and another guy making drums lines, you'd have a political statement. one which you'd call "sleaford mods" and get a Mark Fisher wire essay with. in america though, we don't get that. things are so bleak and hollowed out that instead you get two white chumps making...anthemic dystopian music for band kids (and also people who would get deep into q-anon) I deeply GET why the band kids at my high school WORSHIPPED |-/ and Blurryface (not Blurry by Puddle of Mudd, unfortunately). The tempos reach for the heavens and the transcendence a high school football game and the rowdy crowd can provide. And at times, |-/'s polyglot postmodern anonymous sound sorta connects into something deeply admirable and not complete ass. The weird touches of reggae? the white guy's desperate want to uhh transcend race (conveyed via rapping and in one delirious moment, pitch-shifting his voice)? the "hey soul sister"-ass ukulele that rears its deranged head over half the album? who WOULDNT want to reinterpret something off this as a drum line for their high school football band to kick a three point field goal to, miss, and lose the game? Blurryface fascinates me and kept me on my toes. I do believe that this album, unlike the others in this rate, is a net positive for society and an actually decent album that I'm glad to listen to. When I was in europe post-high school I talked about this album with a friend who commended the band for all the sounds they went for and the next time I saw her, she was deep into metal. There are probably several people who heard this as teens truly blossomed into a polyglot of their own sounds and I think that's genuinely beautiful. it also contained ONE emo song! holy shit roxie! 3mo had 1 emo song! 2 less than I expected, but Im feasting

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.286): The definition of "frontloaded." I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and listened to the second half with an open mind, but nah. The first half is almost non-stop bangers, but the rest? Kinda boring. Doesn't help that we're basically pitting Tyler against vocal heavyweights Brendon and Patrick… 21P didn't have a chance. At least their singles are still bangers.

**bogo** (6.250): i think this will probably have the most detractors because of how divisive its fusion of genres in but honestly, even though i am not a big fan of this album, or 21p in general, anymore i still do think there are some unique and great songs on here. however there are also a handful of misfires and embarrasing lines on this album so i do not think i need to accept this back into my life. p.s. tyler be a better ally

**welcome2thejam** (6.143): Big roller coaster album, has more high scores than the other two albums, as well as some absolute duds that really annoyed me. Sports ad break commercial core songs total: 7/14, solid score but probably did not make Fox Sports 1's AOTY list

**xxipil0ts** (5.943): this album has the same vibes as the dream SMP and not in a good way

**moonagenightmares** (4.814): did bts rip off this album cover?

**whatsanillinois** (4.714): this is the thinking man's patd

**throwaway-7650** (4.264): starting to have many questions for a certain clikkie I fear

**CarlieScion** (4.214): my main beef is that they ruined the letter Ø on the internet

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.143): uhh yeah i did not like this album lol. growing up even though i was a huge fan of fob and patd i was simply never interested in checking out twenty one pilots despite them arguably being bigger than both of them combined, mostly because of how much i HATED stressed out back then (and still do) and didnt want to listen to a whole album that just sounded like stressed out. combine that with the infamous “platforms” tweet that came out years later and i have nothing but negative feelings towards this band. and i will admit, this album has good ideas! some of the songs in here would actually be REALLY good with a different vocalist/lyrics, which is easily the biggest thing here holding me back from enjoying it more. but man the rapping on here is just painful to listen to, its just the absolute worst 2deep4u verses imaginable being delivered by someone who really should NOT be trying to rap. i forgot what point i was trying to make at beginning of this album review oops roxie pls dont reject this ballot for sabotage

**apatel27** (4.071): Whoever told them they can rap doesn't deserve rights

**hikk** (3.857): sorry this average is so bad. i hadn't heard this album before the rate, my only knowledge was the big hits which i have always hated. i think it's def a case of "you had to be there". i really don't like tyler's rapping, he sounds obnoxious every time, the songs where he Doesn't Do That are the only decent ones. tear in my heart is kinda a smash tho so that's a nice discovery

im considering lowering my previous tens to 9.9 just to highlight how much i love this song compared to the other ones. I dont think its a stretch to call this one of the best, if not the best 10s era panic song. Im writting this comment before the rate goes up and as much as I'd like to see fob take the crown, I cant deny how good this would be as a rate winner because its so good.

Alright its after the rate, and ill be honest, I was praying on this songs downfall for a good 3 weeks. It was between this and uma thurman, and I wanted uma to get the win! This song is good but it was getting the wrong kind of attention, attention from the '*finally a good song in 3mo*' Crowd that just made me annoyed. Of course this meant it started getting all of the 11s and I basically called it that 3rd week that this was gonna be the winner and i was gonna have to sit with it.

Of course this was until the great coup where 21 pilots took over the rate with practically the entire top 3 and I instead had to start praying for this songs upfall in order to take on top and win because if i have to choose between the two, ill take this anyday. 

This song was actually gunning for the lowest winner crown before unreleased got revealed so much so I'd often !np twice - the feels to hint at the rate. Does it deserve to be? No but dear god at least it got an 8

**akanewasright** (11): This definitely could’ve been sent to pop radio and killed it… we needed this instead of high hopes

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (11): OH I FORGOT ABOUT THE KEY CHANGE.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Ugh you ever just the black magic of Mulholland Drive swimming pools under desert skies drinking white wine in the blushing light just another LA devotee sunsets on the evil eye invisible to the Hollywood shrine always on the hunt for a little more time just another LA devotee? Cause sometimes I do feel that way.

**criestotheclicking** (11): this song is honestly really good, my favourite from the album by a country mile. too bad the music video SUCKS

**hikk** (11): the chorus the key change mwah

**ignitethephoenix** (11): he put his whole Uriethra into this

**ImADudeDuh** (11): he put his WHOLE pussy in this

**intheaftermath** (11): There's just so much to love about this song. It's electric, the chorus is anthemic and Brendon's vocals are at their best (especially when compared to Viva Las Vengeance). Relistening to this album is making me realize how many middle-school memories I have that are tied to this body of work. This one brings me right back to Thanksgiving 2015, where I painstakingly tried to get a YouTube upload of it to work so I could hear it for the first time. Yes, it was worth the ridiculous amount of cellular data I spent on that.

**MassiveThief** (11): The last perfect Panic! song. Maybe the last one ever. It's just a wonderfully written pop rock song with great lyrics and a KILLER chorus. Throw in a key change to boot.

**pig-serpent** (11): Cruisin' down a mountain road overlooking a city at sunset.  You just had to be there man.

**poemforsmallthings** (11): I LOVE LISTENING TO MUSIC AND HAVING FUN!!!!!! AND WE LOVE YOU NOAH SCHNAPP

**RandomHypnotica** (11): an indie pop rock vibe and astrology lyrics, this has u/cremeebrulee written all over it

**rotating3Dtext** (11): this is the most fun song on this rate

**timothy444** (11): Pretty hard 11 to give but it goes to this song. I love how fun and catchy this is and that pitch change in the final chorus elevates this beautiful masterpiece. Brendon also sounds the least like Freddie Mercury here as well and more like someone completely original like the old Panic! days

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Sorry for being that LA/Hollywood fanatic but… this song basically soundtracked the beginning of my young adult life, going off to college in the City of Angels. I fell in love instantly, I immersed myself in all things Los Angeles (yes I was also obsessed with La La Land, you know how it is), and this song was a burst of joy that perfectly encapsulated all of my feelings from living in this strange, bewitching, wonderful place. Years and years later, I still live here, I still love it here, and I still love this song!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): i want nothing more than for this to slumber party

**bigbigbee** (10): this song definitely provided the blueprint for future misses (High Hopes, Viva Las Vengeance…actually, tbh, I like those songs but I think that that’s unpopular among fans), but it really works here

**bogo** (10): oh i forgot how good this song was wtf

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i faked this being my 0 and people were OUTRAGED and rightfully so

**dreamingpastel** (10): Excellent song. Nothing more to say.

**frogaranaman** (10): isn’t that just a Scientologist

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Okay my feet are TAPPING rn, we have a bop! I think that a lot of the songs on this album are kind of choppy, like there are so many melodic sections with harsh cuts between them, but this one is an uninterrupted river of infectious energy.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): sorry, Brendon, but I'm more of a top devotee

**modulum83** (10): this shit is incredible like god damn those drums? that little synth riff in the second verse? the key change? absolutely fucking life-changing running through downtown with the wind in your face type music

**seanderlust** (10): the chokehold this had on my jogging playlist for several years

**Stryxen** (10): Music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): going through the five stages of grief while listening to this song and finally accepting that maybe it is the best song ever after all

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is what ppl want the new paramore album to sound like

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hey, finally, a Panic song that I can put my full support behind! Sure, it's yet another song about Living In Los Angeles, but idc we take these. A good time the whole way through

**velvet-gloves** (9.8): the instrumental on this absolutely slaps

**jay** (9): YASSSSS

**Puppy\_Basket** (9): slaps

**runaway3212** (9): honestly I love rich LA people saying like "LA is horrible! All these rich hot people want to hang out with you but they're also obsessed with you" like the problem is not probleming bestie

**steelstepladder** (9): SEE!!! I can like a Panic song

**TiltControls** (9): okay this is catchy, I'll give him that

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): i can see why it's patd's frontrunner (aka popheads eat anything up with a key change) (i usually dont but this is pleasant)

**isthesweetestcon** (8.5): this is actually good??? i would never hear this and think it was panic (at least from back in the day sorry not sorry for the hipster) but it’s good. i’m saving it to my playlist.

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (8.2): This song is post-Ryan Ross P!ATD at their best.

**CarlieScion** (8): men stop writing songs about women challenge (but it slaps, sadly)

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (8): a little bit overrated but still great

**starlitsuns** (8): this is so good like… it's a damn shame my panic! phase ended years ago because this rocks

**Awkward\_King** (9.500): if i may be vulnerable for a moment: seeing the hate this album has been receiving and the averages it's been getting have baffled me to no end, in fact to the point i had to message roxie and ask if i was missing something skjddskj. something like drag rate getting low averages i understand, the rate was very camp, a lot of bad singers and trashy pop, it made sense to me. now i may be very naive but like.... this is a good album?? like I DONT UNDERSTAND THE ALBUM BOPS IT WAS BACK WHEN BRENDON URIE COULD SING AND HE STILL HAD GOOD LYRICS IN HIM LIKE!?!?!?!?!?!??!???!?!?!

**hikk** (9.500): this is so embarrassing for me but i'm gonna own it THIS ALBUM SLAYS! he managed to make something really obnoxious that knows it is obnoxious and it's just so fun, so happy that he put out this great project as panic's swansong and we haven't had any new releases since!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.455): this comes fifth in my personal ranking of their albums and I don't think it is a step-down as many fans think. For all I know Brendon evolved the sound trying to keep up with the times, and he's not doing a bad job at all. Most fans feel nostalgic about their old sound so they dismiss his "modern" work but the change sounds very natural to me.

**moonagenightmares** (9.327): loving this album is my toxic trait

**throwaway-7650** (8.855): u/hikkaru you were right...

**RandomHypnotica** (8.473): the last time i was really hooked on panic was TWTLTRTD, and i just never ended up listening to this album. I know that if I had i would’ve been absolutely HOOKED

**MassiveThief** (8.455): A pretty life defining album for me. without a DOUBT Panic!'s last good album, and one of their best. Brendon was in his perfect pop rock bag before completely submitting to radio fodder.

**pig-serpent** (8.273): One of the best pop albums of the 2010s.  Brendon's making this Baz Lurman Las Vegas party pop stand out and feel glorious.  I don't know who produced this album, but I really want to know why they didn't produce the follow ups.

**CarlieScion** (8.000): I hate that I spent actual hard earned money to buy this record on vinyl

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.955): As someone predisposed to hate Brendon Urie, I made a real effort to score only on the merits of the music itself. Getting super into Marianas Trench right before this rate helped me acquire a new perspective (ha ha); if I felt the primal misandrist urge to tank a song, I would honestly ask myself: would I eat this up if Josh Ramsay did it? Self-awareness is a beautiful thing!!

**DakotaTheFolfyBoi** (7.818): Very catchy album. Just a nice little pop album, it doesn't claim to be anything more. Its pretty nice.

**celladonn** (7.727): This is the last Panic album I really enjoyed and part of that is that it hit at the right time for me but honestly it still mostly holds up!

**poemforsmallthings** (7.591): this record is FUN!!!!!!! everyone stop acting like Panic stopped releasing good music after 2011 </3

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.582): brendon urie you will rot in hell for real

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.545): Brendon Urie… you win this round. With how much High Hopes has utterly ANNOYED me the past few years I almost forgot that I actually liked a Panic record. Heck, I still love it, and it's still one of my favorite albums period. I think this was their sweet spot, they pushed their sound as far as they could into pop territory without completely falling on their face (cough that's Pray for the Wicked). The bops were unforgettable, Brendon was still only mildly smarmy, and everything was right in the pop punk world.

**modulum83** (7.273): i can’t explain it but this is uncle rock. this is proudly brainless party music that doesn’t have any deeper purpose other than to soundtrack getting shitfaced drunk, but it does work as that. the performances are great, as is the production - in particular, the horns and drums consistently sound perfectly punchy. that said, this is an album that is consistently decent but doesn’t quite have that transcendent pop stickiness; it’s so good at being half-remembered party music that it ends up seamlessly settling into disposable product. this album is like family guy: lots of wacky moments, but a crippling lack of ambition (and a guy that is WAYYYY too into broadway showtunes)

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.227): unfortunately this is not a terrible album. I wish I could dunk on Brendon Urie, but DOAB is a fairly average album where at least three of the tracks still hold up today. You win this one, Brendon.

**whoisValensi** (7.182): I was originally gonna write a whole ass essay about how this album was the last good Panic! album, but upon second thought, that might be wrong. I'm starting to think the last good good Panic! album was Too Weird, but also that's my favorite so maybe I'm a little biased in that regard.

**timothy444** (7.136): I have strong mixed opinions on Brendon Urie trying to imitate the musical voice perks of Freddie Mercury and combine it with pop punk elements. At times, it really works but other times it just falls flat because it teeters on the edge of becoming a bad parody of the late singer himself. That said, I didn't hate this album as much as I expected, so there's that.

**cremeebrulee** (7.091): they based the entirety of bojack horseman off this album cover

**welcome2thejam** (6.545): Simultaneously better and worse than I expected going in. There's a few bright spots and nothing pissed me off (mind you, I see Panic at the Disco - Bohemian Rhaspody down there and I'm already fuming, but that's Suicide Squad's problem). Still not close to enough to shake my overall bad perception of Panic. Sports ad break commercial core songs total: 9/11 (investigate Brendon Urie, ME! was an inside job)

**jackisboredtoday** (6.518): There are a few good songs here, but this album was kinda the moment Panic started to lose me after their first few albums all had a few songs I beat into the ground. Revisiting it there’s definitely a few songs that hold up due to a mixture of nostalgia and genuinely being solid, but a couple songs here (like Victorious) kinda grew off me now that I’m hearing it without the excitement about it being new Panic!

**nick1372** (6.182): In theory, this is a great album. The concept is perfect for Panic's image, and the music is cohesive and fits the topics well; Brendan even sounds good. But it just runs out of ideas by the second half.

**musical\_pyn** (6.136): this sounds so much worse than I remember it being?? Like I used to listen to a lot of these songs for fun, how has it aged so badly?

**Stryxen** (6.000): okaayyy miss disco

Roxieloxie: **TiltControls** (5.955): well at least it didn't have Bohemian Rhapsody on it

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.409): i’m something of a panic stan myself but sadly i believe too weird was their last good album…hence my score

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.364): my favorite Panic! album! (the only other one I heard is PftW)

**xxipil0ts** (5.191): whatever you do, don't go to the p!atd subreddit+

**steelstepladder** (4.682): theater kid energy (derogatory)

**frogaranaman** (4.455): this album is why we have to be doubtful of poptimism and theater nerds

**bogo** (4.455): of all the bands in this rate, panic is perhaps the one i fell out of love with the hardest. i used to be kinda obsessed with them but gradually as time went on and more and more stuff came out about how shit brendon was as a person i slowly stopped listening to them as often as i did and i eventually just dropped them all together out of disgust. i practically went from loving the band to never wanting anything to do with them ever again overnight. this rate was probably my first time listening to panic since early 2020, and revisiting this album i can honestly say that i do not regret dropping this band for one second, because most of the songs on here are laughably bad. with all of the original members gone, brendon does all of the writing on the album, and let me tell you, he is a terrible writer. he tries to go for a mix of show tunes, jazz, and rock music and a lot of it ends up being really cheesy and annoying, partially because for half these songs brendon tries to show off his vocal range when he really, REALLY shouldn't. it all comes off like something the overdramatic theater kid at your old high school who got WAY too into their roles would probably make but coated in a thick layer of unpleasant cockiness and sleaziness. and then there's just two really great songs just sitting in the middle of all of that and it pisses me off cause we could've had a really decent pop rock album if brendon stuck to the sound of those songs instead of trying to be party animal frank sinatra

**flava** (3.955): whoever produced this needs to learn that not every instrument needs to have the same volume in the mix because my head started hurting about midway through or it could be worse, we could be rating either of the two albums afterwards

**apatel27** (2.864): He just sounds too self important. It's moody but with a pretentious aura that just gives unsuccessful fuckboy

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (2.782): cannot wait to see why and how people convince themselves to give this high scores. albums like this truly make me go "damn mb we SHOULD force radiohead down people's throats". i shudder at that thought, but brendon urie (sans his falsetto shockingly--i dont mind that) is truly the most punchable motherfucker in this rate. And with death of a bachelor he concocted a bleak, bleak slab of unfun, unearned rainbow vomit pop-rock; the kind designed to be sold at target alongside a band shirt. it's not emo. not one bit. it's just a giant identity crisis of an LP ready to be latched onto by way more people than I ever realized really. if at least i could sort of see a case for Superorganism within their colossal frown inducing misfire, what I hear is the toxic cesspool of "bipolar hellfire, sorta feel good" car commercial radio staring into the abyss and never once being able to redeem itself. it breaks new scoring records for me because of this. let's go brendon!

TiltControls: Great job hosting Roxie!!! Did I know what was going most of the time? Not really! (If you check my exit poll responses that probably becomes obvious). But it was a blast regardless!

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!
