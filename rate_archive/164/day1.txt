Yeah there should be no surprise about this. While this song wasnt always last, It quickly stayed that way and it didnt move. Ill be honest I havent even heard this cover myself but no matter what score i give it, it wont change. I really only inlcuded this because I got asked if i was gonna include heathens and then saw this on the tracklist as well. I dont really have much else to say other than why did so many of yall like this?

---


#The people who liked this 

**Bandito21Dema** (11): absolute masterpiece of a cover and even better live

**KappyKo** (11): Bop!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The original ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù is so annoying so covering it badly is so galaxy brain, I see you Brendon

**IIIHenryIII** (10): there was a time I thought this was better than the original, silly me. Who am I kidding? I still think it is

**intheaftermath** (10): look I'm sorry. he kills this.

**throwaway-7650** (10): camp

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): *psst* Brendon. You know when you do a cover, you‚Äôre supposed to make it different.

**DakotaTheFolfyBoi** (8): Pretty nice cover

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): he (this film) don't got a single song (scene) where he (brendon) need to be doing this (this)

**emayzee** (7.2): i have purposely avoided this for the past 6 years and dare i say it's........not even nearly as bad as i thought it would be

**celladonn** (7): i want to tank this because it really is exactly the same as the original but worse but like. it's still such a good song that i can't help but enjoy this version

**emoforever1927** (7): not a big queen fan but he and the band does this song so well

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it‚Äôs definitely a cover of Bo Rhap

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): what a transparent attempt to break records for the lowest scores‚Äô/most 0‚Äôs ever, i will not be a part of this, since I have to give points to Brendon for the audacity to release audio torture entirely under his name.

**BreadlessCrust** (6.5): i cant rate this....

**1998tweety** (6): i wanna hate on this cause the original is much better but tbh this isnt awful

**mysario** (6): the most impressive part of the movie is most of the soundtrack is played within the first 10 minutes of the movie but you'll never watch it (nor should watch it) to fact check me

**velvet-gloves** (6): a serviceable cover, technically very proficient, but doesn‚Äôt hit the emotional beats of the song.

#People That Didnt

**heysoupie** (5.1): Thought this was either going to be terrible or great and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶moderately bad. Like, if I saw this at live karaoke I‚Äôd be entertained but if I heard it on the radio I‚Äôd be‚Ä¶irritated.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Oh something tells me this isn‚Äôt going to go over too well here on r/wehaterockheads. I just want it on record that I‚Äôm not edgy enough to hate the original version at least.

**krusso1105** (5): the original is one of my favorite songs. It's an okay cover, but I don't know why you would listen to this instead

**moonagenightmares** (5): i was hoping this wasnt a cover of THE bohemian rhapsody

**pig-serpent** (5): He misses a few notes and this doesn't need to exist, but it's not offensively bad or anything.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): well

**whatsanillinois** (5): i am glad there are few brendon urie-isms in this. he has an obsession with gross sounding trumpets tho

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (4.2): this guy needs to be on the masked singer and do this. that's the only context i can imagine his cornball indulgent shtick works. the fact they sorta did a legit redux of this like it was vince vaughn doing psycho in '98 sorta earns the whole 4.2 points for me. people who bully that falsetto will get their field day.

**isthesweetestcon** (4): i‚Äôm giving it a 4 just because i respect the original and what he was trying to do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

**runaway3212** (4): this sucks but it's still better than the original

**ScrtSuperhero** (4): - it's the way this man can't even HIT these notes anymore that's embarrassing

**seanderlust** (3.5): this is karaoke - and mid karaoke at that

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (3.5): Does Brendon still cover this song live? I hope not.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): did even brendon think this was a good idea

**dreamingpastel** (3): What is going ON with everything from 3:02 to 4:04? Why do some parts sound like they were recorded via voicemail? Was that two Muppets or just Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco singing the "Galileo, Galileo" part? Who on Earth is singing "I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me" and why do they sound like a haunted doll? Hello???

**ImADudeDuh** (3): it was a struggle

**king bestie** (3): the beginning feels like he‚Äôs aggressively whispering it in my ear and i can‚Äôt escape

**MassiveThief** (3): y'all are BEGGING for this man to be bullied

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): why did brendon add the indie girl voice tremble to the verses ctfu

**indie\_fan\_** (2.7): roxie i was planning to forgive you for excluding the irresistible remix, but not anymore

**bigbigbee** (2): I was listening to this on the subway and in the window, I watched my face involuntarily contract into a grimace when he said ‚Äúinnnniiweeyyy the wind blows‚Äù

**nick1372** (2): Panic! doing Bohemian Rhapsody is alright on paper but in practice is a total shitshow. This is an uncoverable song because you need to have all of Freddie's conviction to even come close. You CANNOT make this camp!! Brendan Urie has never sang anything without irony in his entire life and he certainly did not start with this song. He can't even hit the notes who allowed this.

**welcome2thejam** (2): I see six minutes on the clock and am tempted to break my rating streak at the last song to not endure this

**akanewasright** (1): ‚Äúmom can we have Freddie Mercury‚Äù 

‚Äúwe have Freddie Mercury at home‚Äù 

Freddie Mercury at home:

**apatel27** (1): Who gave Brandon Urie this ego? Why is he the way he is?

**Awkward\_King** (1): oh my god he literally cant sing in this im ctfu

**bogo** (1): i think it's a real bold move to try to cover this song when not even queen could make it sound good

**CarlieScion** (1): loxie I hate u for including this [2]

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): I tried to convince myself that I liked this. That Brendon Urie was the Freddie Mercury of the 21st century. That this was a sign that Panic! At the Disco were a band that were just as good, if not better, than Queen. Unfortunately none of the above are true, and I will not be silenced when I say that this is probably worse than every single song on PFTW, and is also just an excuse for Brendon Urie to get high on the euphoria of stroking his own ego.

**flava** (1): im gonna treat this like a bonus rate and refrain from using my 0 on it, but let me be clear, this is the WORST song in the rate by a margin larger than the Pacific Ocean

**frogaranaman** (1): absolutely fucking not

**hikk** (1): i don't even like the original, So
[/r/popheads/comments/10h4er2/emo_rate_3_rate_reveal_day_1_twenty_one_can_you/j56oihz/]

=====

Roxieloxie: **Hulnia** (1): i mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still better than the original, at least brendon can somewhat sell a song this stupid. shame they couldn‚Äôt improve the opera section though‚Ä¶

**impla77** (1): You know this is Brendan Urie‚Äôs wet dream

**jay** (1): to the other

**letsallpoo** (1): I hope I never learn the context behind this

**poemforsmallthings** (1): PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE

**Stryxen** (1): LMFAO

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): by all accounts this should've been my 0 but it's going out last place anyway. couldn't stick around till the end of this

**whoisValensi** (1): I'm tired so I'm gonna make this really fucking quick for once. This. cover. ruined. Panic!. Yes. This is the cover that did Panic in as we knew them. The death kneel, the final gasp of the old panic, the death rattle... I find myself consistently amazed out how the studio version of this cover is completely ass because it's good live but then everyone got so excited that... Suddenly every time you turned around, Brendon wanted his voice to SOAR and he wanted to show you his RANGE. And then it bled into PFTW and ruined that album (on top of like a whole slew of other shit) and VLV is... well... There are reasons why those concert videos went viral on TikTok/Bandom Twitter. I'll rest my case there but like... This cover was the worst thing to happen to Panic and I wish it never would have made the soundtrack because it brought everything to a whole other level of shit.

**-y-y-y-** (0): , -1000, negative a million, my ears are bleeding

**criestotheclicking** (0): I think this is a bad cover because Brendon Urie clearly thinks he is qualified when he is not. This and the entirety of Viva Las Vengeance have the exact same energy (I haven‚Äôt listened to anything past the singles).

**daythreeinmiami** (0): That pretentious roll of his ‚Äòr‚Äôs on ‚Äòthrown away‚Äô. This is an abomination. This is one of the worst things to come out of Suicide Squad. It would be the worst, but Jared Leto is in that film.

**LilacDaffodils** (0): Brendon you will never be him

**lordofthpotat0** (0): gotdam

**modulum83** (0): no. nope. absolutely not! we‚Äôre not doing this.

**nt96** (0): Lil Dicky's finally found a new buddy in the lowest averages section

**starlitsuns** (0): Freddie Mercury's grave experienced extreme pain from this track

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I already hated this but the horrendous off key falsetto "Galileo" was what really pushed this into 0 territory

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): no more bohemian rhapsody covers, especially from theater kids

**TiltControls** (0): it's not so bad if you just filter out the vocals and listen to the instrumental

**timothy444** (0): I was already over this cover before the song even hit the halfway point and it's all because of Brendon Urie's vocal delivery and butchering of this track. Feels like it's trying to be a PG-kinda edgy take on the original.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i zero'd the original so it would be camp for me not to zero this but alas i have dignity

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): The SHEER AMOUNT OF HUBRIS to think you're even WORTHY of covering this song

Yeah this is deserved. I remember this being by far one of my least favorites on the album. Its pretty awful until the rap verse starts and if the best thing you have to look forward to in a pilots song is the rap,,,, well

# The Few Who Understand

**emayzee** (10): the #86 song on my spotify wrapped in the year 2022

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love top and used to be very invested in them, but I can't deal with their fandom and now I've just realized some of these lyrics enable them to act the way they do, and this is coming from a swiftie lol

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): who knew that the faux deep would actually work for once

**-y-y-y-** (9): , never mind I'm back on the anti-mainstream hype fuck the establishment fuck the media

**celladonn** (9): there's just something about this one

**daythreeinmiami** (9): Tyler taught me how to be a poet in this song.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i just KNOW this kills live

**runaway3212** (8): a full bop why lie

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): kinda wild Katy Perry didn‚Äôt sue this song for that bridge, it really sounds like Dark Horse lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This is a little ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cut yourself on all that edge‚Äù but you know what why else are we doing this rate??

**LilacDaffodils** (7.3): not good but I like it anyway.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): the back half of this album was rough but this is very clearly the standout of this phase of the album for me

**emoforever1927** (7): got this rating partially for the lyric "only few understand" gets me everytime!

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): oh i‚Äôve heard this one before

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (6.8): b-bastille?!

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): me whenever i have to host a rate

# They're Right, It isnt for Everyone

**intheaftermath** (6.5): it's like fairly local but a little less fun

**isthesweetestcon** (6.5): again i love the concept but the execution doesn‚Äôt really do it for me

**bigbigbee** (6): all these internal rhymes? Googles when Hamilton came out

**dreamingpastel** (6): That was a journey and a half.

**frogaranaman** (6): THE COMMENTS ARE CUMMING??

**whoisValensi** (6): Oh... Oh??? This may be better than I remembered, that's good, I think.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): the alien outro is so slayful

**pig-serpent** (5.5): ugh, this had such a promising start and then it turned into a husk of a codreggae song...  Then it has the nerve to drop a great bridge in the middle of its mediocrity.

**1998tweety** (5): this exists

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): I don‚Äôt get why this is a fan-favourite.

**mysario** (5): thinking about [this tweet](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/325133192778612738/1059997525790183555/tyler_joseph_platform_tweet.jpg) while listening to this

**Stryxen** (5): just here

**bogo** (4): if you enjoy life please make sure to like comment and subscribe

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): you‚Äôll never be the pusherman

**steelstepladder** (4): this experiment didn't really work...

**whatsanillinois** (4): did win butler write this song. gross

**impla77** (3.5): you need to have a very high iq to get these lyrics

**apatel27** (3): eminem really had every white boy thinking talking fast is rapping

**modulum83** (3): possibly the most embarrassing chorus of all time

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Oh my god stop being so pretentious

**criestotheclicking** (2): this is just Lane Boy but without a good drum beat and is even more self-aggrandising. Once I realised how awful the faux-reggae of this album is, I can't bear to listen to half of it. The rap is probably the best part of the song but no this is not rap nor is it hip hop.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): he really thinks he‚Äôs being clever huh

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): you need to be very intelligent to understand the message

**welcome2thejam** (2): Oh buddy this is ass

**CarlieScion** (1): eh eh eh no no no - me listening to this song

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): I think this is the Blurryface song with the worst lyrics, it‚Äôs like they said ‚Äúyeah, this sounds deep and rhymes, drop it‚Äù without actually checking if it sounds good

**Hulnia** (1): this is what i imagine an ajr & imagine dragons collab would sound like

**RandomHypnotica** (1): [this bridge](https://www.diplomacy.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hussaini1.jpg)

**akanewasright** (0): the way this is just every kind of awful that this band has to offer‚Ä¶

This deserved better !! IIRC this was the first 'new' song panic! song that dropped since I had gotten into them, I have vivid memories of hearing this in the computer lab in 8th grade inbetween sneaking onto to ao3 to read fic. Since the song dropped im not sure if I like it lyrically or not but I like it enough melodically , that combined with the nostalgia makes it a 10. 

This settled around a nice #27 before it slowly kept falling, at one point even beeing second out until the very in where a few more people decided that message man was more of a crime that this 

---


#Show Praise with Your Scores

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this was the first Panic! song I remember ever hearing. If I could go back in time, I would convince myself that stanning Panic! was never worth it

**emoforever1927** (10): this song's melody never fails for me

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the only Christian song that matters

**moonagenightmares** (10): üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà?

**velvet-gloves** (9.2): great ear worm

**king bestie** (9): I‚Äôm not afraid to admit a moment you‚Äôll never remember and a night you‚Äôll never forget was revolutionary why are you

**throwaway-7650** (9): this was a 10 until he started sounding bad

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this just reminds me of a friend who was obsessed with this song. actually the same friend who got be into big and chunky.

**poemforsmallthings** (8.5): this debuted in My Room's Bubbling Under Hot 100 at #10 in 2015

**heysoupie** (8.3): This song feels like it would have fit in during the original P!atD days, but somehow also not outdated

**emayzee** (8): im hearing hints of high hopes here but this is much better

**frogaranaman** (8): that intro sounds like he‚Äôs doing a Greatest Showman impression

**intheaftermath** (8): I can't listen to this song after performing it at a cruise ship karaoke bar for a bunch of drunk white adults when I was 15. The stares... I'll never forget it

**TiltControls** (8): ngl with the other panic covers/samples in the rate I was a little worried this would be another

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): I‚Äôm being a little nice to this bc I can‚Äôt separate it from playing it a lot out of excitement at them being back when this was the lead single

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this is just a Macklemore song

**nick1372** (7.5): I have a sweet spot for this one because I became a real Panic! fan right after it released but it's really not too special

**1998tweety** (7): take me to church

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): I constantly forget that this one exists.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i listened to this song like 5 times because i just don‚Äôt know what I think of it

**hikk** (7): paramore cleared

#Sinners 

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Omg I FINALLY have an audience of people who might understand: Does anyone else find Brendon's phrasing in this song to be really annoying? "My life started theday I got ca-ught", "stop thinking a-bo-ut the bullets from my mou-th", the random "oh" that only serves to fill up space‚Ä¶ am I being really anal about this?

**whoisValensi** (7): "A moment you'll never remember and a night you'll never forget". Will that be me tonight because I finished watching 'Skinamarink' like 2 hours ago and it's really fucking with me the more it sinks, or will it be because I'm cutting it really close on my extended extension for this rate to the point where I will straight up forget what the fuck I wrote down anywhere here.

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (6.7): bit eh, but I still enjoyed it

**modulum83** (6.2): check this out: i made a song about religion but it‚Äôs actually about having hot hot sex! this is a new innovation nobody has ever done before!

**-y-y-y-** (6): , I remember this song fondly from the excessively long period of time that it was the only single from the album but it's fallen off

**criestotheclicking** (5.7): this is a bad opening stretch to this album. I‚Äôve always thought the track ordering was nonsensical but a rate ballot is not the place to go into detail about my prospective repairs to the track listing. Also bad mixing?? The intro for this song is unnecessarily quiet and then it just explodes when the chorus comes around for no reason.

**daythreeinmiami** (5.5): I‚Äôm just glad he didn‚Äôt do a cover of ‚ÄòHallelujah‚Äô. His vocals would have annoyed me.

**Bandito21Dema** (5): ehh

**BreadlessCrust** (5): chorus carries this song

**CarlieScion** (5): the verses sound so awkward

**nt96** (5): Lord help me right now

**pig-serpent** (5): Maybe the best hook Panic's ever had, but the rest of the song is jarring and barely fits.  The huge drum fill doesn't fit the song, the verses mean nothing and have lackluster instrumentals.  It's always pained me that this song should be so much better than it is.

**Puppy\_Basket** (5): Blandest Hallelujah

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is dangerously close to being something that could have been on Gossamer

**welcome2thejam** (5): This has the design of this grandiose emo classic, but the tools & execution just aren't quite there

**bigbigbee** (4.5): you can really tell he was a Vine star

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): when i was in high school i always sat next to the BIGGEST panic stan i have ever met in the lunch room and whenever she talked about how much she loved their music she would always make it a point to say that hallelujah was the exception and that she absolutely HATEDDDD this song so much and i cant exactly fault her for that take, anyway i hope she listened to viva las vengeance and hated it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3.5): Victorious is a fun drunk song, this is a throwing up in the Taco Bell bag drunk song.

**bogo** (3.5): this is turning me into one of those annoying reddit atheists

**steelstepladder** (3.5): God has nothing to do with this keep him out of it

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (3.2): Is this the worst lead single P!ATD has ever chosen? Yes.

**apatel27** (3): The whitest Hallelujah song

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): wall of noise, I‚Äôm splattering into this like Wile E Coyote

**isthesweetestcon** (3): in his jesus is king era

**ScrtSuperhero** (3): - docked points because of his garbage dancing in the music video

**Stryxen** (3): this has to be one of the songs in the rate

**whatsanillinois** (3): why does every MV feature him being predatory to a woman

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (2.4): midi trumpets are sonic terrorism. this man has gone 3/3 on predatory videos. you know what emo band doesn't do that? glass beach. and its a real shame bc I feel like glass beach truly redeem so so so much of the frustrating rainbow vomit sound palette of this album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): hmm. i‚Äôm not feeling it. at all

**runaway3212** (2): this almost beats the leonard cohen song in a boring-off

**dreamingpastel** (1): A weird mess.

**impla77** (1): I can now empathise with the emos offended at this being considered emo

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): my least favorite title for a song! at the Disco

**ImADudeDuh** (0): im sorry but everything about this is so weird and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on purpose

**jay** (0): no

**seanderlust** (0): "being blue is better than being over it" ....no it's not? what are you talking about. sorry this isn't good it's just loud. brendon's voice sounds strained, the metaphor doesn't make sense, the mix gives me a headache, is he saying his life got better when he cheated on someone? yeah no this is a 0

For as much as I did like twenty one pilots for that two year period from the end of middle school through 10th grade this song always made me feel weird! There was always something weird to me about the ' I wasnt raised in the hood, but I know a thing or too about pain and darkness' line that always just took me out of the song but everyone else i looked in the fandom no one, else was calling it out, so i just kinda quietly just assumed that maybe I was just overacting.

Anyway the two flavours of the white diaspora are that your first rap song was super bass or ,,, this

# Hyperpop 

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I used to think that this was so deep, but it does feel like a good helping of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other girls‚Äù messaging. Tyler is apparently not a poptimist, but I do think that Tyler claiming ‚Äúall these songs are so heartless‚Äù is brave for a dude with the lyrical ability of Fred Durst and a similar amount of credibility.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love the teasing at the end, just when you think it's over‚Ä¶ Josh

**MassiveThief** (10): The synth breakdown almost made me cry live I will not lie

**pig-serpent** (10): This song is full of cliches that I hate (songs about music/the industry, popular bands complaining about being unpopular) yet the mood and the melodies are just perfect.  I love how both verses are different and then the bridge is a huge blast of midi horns and breakbeats that honestly sounds like an internal struggle of doing something off the wall but staying in the confines of what their label will like and what will make them popular with casual music listeners.  I don't think Twenty One Pilots will ever release a song that tops this one.

**steelstepladder** (10): LOVE the drumwork here. Just top notch stuff all around

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): Tyler you're saying absolutely nothing of value but pop off king!

**criestotheclicking** (9): I have a serious soft spot for this despite the questionable lyrics ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt raised in the hood / but I know a thing or two about pain and darkness‚Äù. It‚Äôs interesting to consider Tyler‚Äôs proximity to rap, reggae and hip-hop as predominantly black artforms. That being said, I do really like the lyric ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust a perfect person / and don‚Äôt trust a song that‚Äôs flawless‚Äù despite it coming off as whiny. This song, and Fairly Local and Message Man feel kind of pathetically self-involved in the way that Bebe Rexha‚Äôs ‚Äúupsetting.‚Äù tweet kind of is hahaha

**CrimsonROSET** (9): insert monogenre rant here

**whoisValensi** (9): HONEST THERE'S A FEW SONGS ON THIS RECORD THAT FEEL COMMON... Well, at least he pre-warned us for like... literally the entire rest of this album jesus christ...

**bigbigbee** (8): His vocal performance here is annoying but honestly this song is sticky‚Ä¶that pizzicato

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): They were genrefluid before that was something Spotify called people who listened to five different kinds of indie rock.

**cremeebrulee** (8): oh i‚Äôve heard this one before

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Okay but you don‚Äôt understand that drop is a cultural movement when performed live. Also, I live for the Josh Dun solo at the end.

**modulum83** (8): holy shit i love that little drum and bass outro. lyrics? what lyrics i don‚Äôt know about any lyrics la la la

**rotating3Dtext** (8): remember when "don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless" was all over tumblr?

**timothy444** (8): Gotta say, that second half of the song is magical

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): me not hating this is embarrassing but here we are‚Ä¶ just ignore me on this one pls

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (7.8): this one has strong "heard bob marley" energy and it doesn't suck? although their cornball dances make even more sense to me...band kids did these in 2015. I get it now. Also though, the video's cutting to their live stage set up with all the stuff feels SO MUCH like I'm either deep in Elliot from Mr. Robot's mind OR about to attend a q-anon rally to stop the steal. the fact that these guys were tapping into this feels totally accidental, and funny.

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (7.8): The lyrics for this one are so cringe, but I 100% have some nostalgia bias because I'm in the crowd for this music video. Also Josh goes off on this song.

**indie\_fan\_** (7.4): that back half carries hard sonically

**Awkward\_King** (7): i laughed at rona every time he called this album reggae completely forgetting about these songs and this is my formal apology

**nick1372** (7): I loved this song so much as a teenager and can't figure out what it is now? Maybe it's that guitar(?) lick in the background of the chorus.

**runaway3212** (7): I feel like lane boy is a job I would be really good at

**-y-y-y-** (6.5): , good wordplay but just doesn't hold up to how I remember it

**emayzee** (6.5): well

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (6): Could be worse. Could be better. +1 bonus point for Josh in the outro.

**frogaranaman** (6): this was the foreshadowing to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using my platform‚Äù

**intheaftermath** (6): god I used to unironically tell people I only liked "rap when it's Twenty One Pilots or Hamilton" when I was 13. I am so freaking sorry. Stream Megan Thee Stallion

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this song would be so good if literally anyone else was singing it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Omg it's M E T A

**BreadlessCrust** (5): alright ig

**dreamingpastel** (5): The shift halfway to something more EDM was both unexpected and extremely welcome.

**jay** (5): switch up ate but ..

**Stryxen** (5): this hamilton song (corny and neverending) but enjoyable at least with the last half

**xxipil0ts** (5): : was anyone else chronically online abt this song for being racist or was that just me?

**1998tweety** (4.5): shes ok

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): you dont have to stay in your lane, but please stay in one genre for a single fucking song please

**heysoupie** (4.4): my jaw dropped a little when i read that the vocalist is 34 years old; like ok yea this guy definitely grew up on P.O.D. - things make so much more sense now.

**isthesweetestcon** (4): it‚Äôs giving jesse from breaking bad

**Puppy\_Basket** (4): abysmal flow, kinda cringe

**seanderlust** (4): "i know a thing or two about pain and darkness" ok kingdom hearts protagonist

# You Didnt Have to Admit this

# The Good

**velvet-gloves** (10): this should have been one of those songs where people slapped the lyrics on every gifset they made for their otp on tumblr. it deserved it.

**whoisValensi** (10): 'Hang 'Em High' for straight people.

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): giving this a 9.9 for the missing comma

**IIIHenryIII** (9): summarizing this rate in one phrase be like:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): This song? We‚Äôre gonna put it under‚Ä¶good.

**king bestie** (8.5): good memories attached to this one i will explain no further

**modulum83** (8.5): tumblr fandom AMV fodder (affectionate)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): i kinda wanna see this western

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Underrated

**pig-serpent** (8): I like this a lot more than I remember.  I guess the awkwardness of the chorus has finally been erased by being stuck in my head for 6 years.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this is fine but even fine on this album is legendary and never done before

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The intro to this set off alarm bells in my head but the rest of the track was pleasantly subdued, didn‚Äôt expect this to be one of the more tasteful songs on the album.

**isthesweetestcon** (7.5): this album in general feels to me like a dad rock band is trying to capture the p!atd feel and while i don‚Äôt dislike this song it is exactly what i mean. i‚Äôll give an extra .5 to just how he says ‚Äúi got the final judgement‚Äù

**BreadlessCrust** (7.2): best on the album

**bogo** (7): i choose not to perceive the lyrics because the chorus is kinda bopping

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this production isnt doing him any favors huh

**mysario** (7): this song isn't bad but wow do I forget it's on here every time

**-y-y-y-** (6.5): , I never had any clue what this song was trying to do for the album but it's still an enjoyable listen

**intheaftermath** (6.5): definitely one of the weaker tracks on the album. luckily, I believe this is an insanely good album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the good (fall out boy), the bad (twenty one pilots), and the dirty (panic! at the disco)

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (6.1): worst song on the album

**timothy444** (6): I wish the "Ooh-woah-oh-oh-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh" could've been replaced with something less annoying

**criestotheclicking** (5.9): this is a kind of nothing song.

**dreamingpastel** (5.5): I like the chorus. That's about it.

# The Bad

**Bandito21Dema** (5): too many woahs

**heysoupie** (5): totally forgettable

**ktajlili** (5): I wish this song was about something. Like what even IS the good, the bad, and the dirty?

**ScrtSuperhero** (5): - Best part is the bridge "And all our friends want us to fall in love" is fantastic and the rest of the song is. Bearable.

**Stryxen** (5): he walked out the studio that day with a smug grin i can tell

**impla77** (4.5): There‚Äôs a lot of one of these in this album..

**CarlieScion** (4): extremely average

**jay** (4): hm.

**TiltControls** (4): this sounds like a worse version of another panic song that I'm blanking on

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Sweetie, this literally sounds like farts

**welcome2thejam** (4): Pausing right after the intro to say this song will need to work its way up from a 1 just because of those opening fifteen seconds

**celladonn** (3): Extremely forgettable track

**darj** (3): did this just start off like Miley Cyrus transition music

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever used a day of my education‚Äù oh yeah for sure this song was for cringy 14yos

**runaway3212** (3): he wishes he has what red velvet has

**starlitsuns** (3): the mixing on the chorus is so loud like‚Ä¶ what the hell, it's the bad and the dirty at the same time and not good

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): my favorite Western movie! at the Disco

**daythreeinmiami** (2): Y‚Äôall I‚Äôm trying so hard to get into this album but it‚Äôs just so boring and pretentious and generic.

**steelstepladder** (2): Oh the misery, everybody wants to be his enemy

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): id rather eat dirt

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (1.8): we have to reclaim nu-metal because feckers like brendon urie are pulling shit like this. i guess .8 points for the falsetto?

**apatel27** (1): Cosplaying FOB is a choice

**frogaranaman** (1): he really thought he was gonna get anime edits out of this one

**whatsanillinois** (0): i felt like i was gonna hear a "drop the bass" at any second

Now this is the first elimination that HURTS. Going on I would've never predicted this song to bottom 5 or even the first song on this album to be cut. This song is Insane, amazing energy just truly wow. This was one of the songs fighting for the most conterversial crown while I cried in agony 

---

# I am so sorry to you three personally 

**cremeebrulee** (11): one of my fave FOB songs ever! my friends and i do this at karaoke all the time. also i love how in the chorus, it sounds like he‚Äôs singing ‚Äúi‚Äôm un-american‚Äù like very true bestie

**darj** (11): BOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**emoforever1927** (11): on the album not necessarily in their discography

# The Girls Who Get It

**akanewasright** (10): YASSS SMASHA THEY MADE THIS FOR THE WHORES IN THE CROWD TONIGHT

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is genuinely the peak of lyricism like is taking two titles of 2000 best picture contenders to parallel each other corny? NO, its genius actually.

**BreadlessCrust** (10): the energy, the vocals, the VIBES

**CrimsonROSET** (10): your honor its camp

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this song gives me a The Last of the American Girls vibe, am I the only one? Both songs sound very different but the same at the same time, idk

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the energy they had leftover from The Phoenix went into this WHEW

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can see why some people find this annoying. They are wrong.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the callback to america's suitehearts at the very end ALONE makes this worthy of a 10 but the whole song is such a headbanger, the bridge goes SO HARD live ive never had more fun screaming about how im nothing more than pity sex

**whoisValensi** (10): I might have to stop myself otherwise I may put a fucking 10 on every song this album with my comments being me screaming the lyrics but like... Fuck the haters this title track RULES. MAYBE IF YOU SCREAMED OUT THE LYRICS TO THIS SONG WHILE ALONE IN YOUR HOUSE YOU'D GET IT.

**TiltControls** (9.5): honestly just a blast to listen to

**Bandito21Dema** (9): because yay crazy patrick

**nick1372** (9): love when FOB are just insane. good stuff.

**plastichaxan** (9): I wonder if this references any form of media

**-y-y-y-** (8.5): , this song is the Do I Wanna Know? of this album for me, it doesn't really feel like it goes anywhere but it's enough of a high the whole way through that I don't care

**dreamingpastel** (8.5): The more I listen to this song, the more I like it.

**bigbigbee** (8): Things that make me scream ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM AN AMERICAN‚Äù: deep fried food at state fairs, Olympic women‚Äôs gymnastics, this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): remains a very fun song idgaf

**king bestie** (7): they were so clever for this

**modulum83** (7): this is so nonsensical and deranged you kinda got to give it to them. also this was produced by french house producer sebastian so the beat is actually sick. dudes rock!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is objectively not good but I still kinda have a soft spot for it

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): i went on genius to check the lyrics and can confirm this song is very very deep

#I'll take comments I'm Afraid to Google In Case They End Up Being Glee References For 500 Alex

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I‚Äôm Canadian I can‚Äôt relate (also Patrick Stump‚Äôs lower register sounds like Kurt Hummel‚Äôa lower registering cannot unhear )

# Only Ever Feels Like a misfit

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (6): the way he says psychOUU is weird

**jay** (6): :/

**Stryxen** (6): i hate this man‚Äôs vocals, he can sing but it all sounds so exploded it hurts. Luckily the instrumental is cool, i do wish it changed up like ever tho

**throwaway-7650** (6): sounds like something lach would like

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (6): next level mid that at least is fun to shuffle to i guess? also watching that american beauty beat the shit out of those american psychos (incels?) rips

**welcome2thejam** (6): I deadass can't get a read on this for ratings purposes, I'm gonna give it a gentleman's 6 and ask it kindly to leave my mind

**ScrtSuperhero** (5.5): - altar boys, altered boys, we're the thing that love destroyed üòå

**seanderlust** (5.3): fallout boy's official genius annotation for the chorus line just being the poster for american beauty. :kermit:

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): PSIKoohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

**CarlieScion** (5): surf rock (derogatory)

**ktajlili** (5): This song hinges on the premise of that two movies that absolutely nothing to do with each other go together. The chorus isn't nearly as catchy as irresistible, and the bridge is weird as fuck. But there is something kind of charming about this.

**timothy444** (5): jeez it's like a 12 year old american patriot wrote this song for his anime OTP

**criestotheclicking** (4.7): this song overstays its welcome. I feel like outside of the hook there is nothing to the song.

**heysoupie** (4.2): honestly sounds like the Weezer school of songwriting in that there is likely a spreadsheet somewhere with phrases sorted by syllable length that can be drawn from when writing songs‚Ä¶all of which was inspired by a similar pop-punk/emo chord progressions spreadsheet used to compose the music

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This title reflects the duality of me liking Brendon Urie‚Äôs super obnoxious voice and hating Patrick Stump‚Äôs super obnoxious voice.

**lordofthpotat0** (3): sigma bale grindset

**runaway3212** (3): why did he take vocal lessons from the passion pit guy

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): this has Huey Lewis and the News vibes

**whatsanillinois** (3): at least they're taking a firm anti incel stance

**frogaranaman** (2): you could have told me this was on the Suicide Squad album and I would have believed you

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This is tanking America‚Äôs already nonexistent social stock

**intheaftermath** (2): completely blocked this one out of my memory from eighth grade and thank god for that. this was brutal.

**isthesweetestcon** (2): both movies deserve better than whatever this is

**bogo** (1): every second of this song is more confusing than the last

**daythreeinmiami** (1): one night and one more time, thanks for the memories, even though they went so great, like this song.

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): oh God this is screechy, clearly they took some cues from Brendon Urie with this one.

**impla77** (1): safe to say I felt this was pretty grating

**LilacDaffodils** (1): awful

**musical\_pyn** (1): I can't believe I'm not giving this my zero

**1998tweety** (0): everything about this song sounds horrid

**celladonn** (0): god this is a chore to listen to

**Madiso\_52** (0): feel more like an American psycho everytime I hear this song

**moonagenightmares** (0): the chorus makes me feel like i took a very bad rollercoaster ride and im going to puke my guts out

**pig-serpent** (0): Everyone I know irl regardless of how much they like or hate this album consider this the worst song on the album by far.  This lead to me posting a meme on r/falloutboy and getting roasted for this take.  Anyway, this song is energetic and catchy, but almost every sound on this song grates on my ears and makes it completely insufferable.

**steelstepladder** (0): Big dick swinging Pete Wentz is always my least favorite flavor of Fall Out Boy and this... good lord that is one of the worst bridges I've ever heard. You are no Fred Durst Patrick Stump. That hi-hat sounds like it's being played in reverse somehow, and the whole song sounds so choppy and start stop that I feel sea sick while listening to it. Idk if this is one of the favorites of the rate but I can't stand it. Sorry FoB fans :/

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): "i'm unamerican" sure Patrick

**Uberpigeon** (0): ur not an american psycho ur some dweeby guy who wears a fedora. get a grip. sing about being a loser like a normal person

# Press X 

**lordofthpotat0** (11): eating a cheeseburger rn it was also an 11

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the chorus on this absolutely carries the song, and that‚Äôs a great thing

**IIIHenryIII** (10): how can someone make a song about God sound so cool?

**runaway3212** (10): when this was a tiktok hit and they did absolutely nothing to promote it

**modulum83** (9.3): it‚Äôs so sexy whenever a christian artist makes an extremely edgy song about questioning whether god is real it‚Äôs giving ethel cain

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): this is kinda smashing on a first listen

**emayzee** (9): i didn't think that i'd actually prefer some of these songs now versus years ago but why did this just suddenly click with me (edit: literally as im finalizing my rate scores tyler just played the original demo for this song and i kinda need it now)

**-y-y-y-** (8.5): , fuck those synths are tasty, I forgot how much these guys tickle my ears

**indie\_fan\_** (8.5): [insert electropop rate joke here]

**seanderlust** (8.5): meryl streep outsold

**Puppy\_Basket** (8): only song I come back to

**steelstepladder** (8): We're at the point in the album where they say "okay we have the hits lets get weird"


**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): The better of the weird ones.

**frogaranaman** (7): pressing ‚ÄòX‚Äô

**jay** (7): fierce

**rotating3Dtext** (7): *complicated feelings about religion I won't elaborate on here*

**Stryxen** (7): that is a SYNTH

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): what does Tyler think of Gwen Stefani's band?

**BreadlessCrust** (6.4): hey ive heard this before and didnt even know

**1998tweety** (6): this song kinda just exists but its better than half the album so im scoring it higher

**criestotheclicking** (6): this is categorically not a good song but um nostalgia goggles I guess. ‚ÄúGnawing on the bishops‚Äù is probably some key to the wider lore of Trench and I‚Äôd research if I cared

**dreamingpastel** (6): I like the vocal effects.

**moonagenightmares** (6): hypebeast youtube instrumental [2]

**nick1372** (5.5): for a song with a mediocre chorus the chorus is too much of the song

# Catboy Interlude

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): why does the synthesizer in the beginning sound like a cat meowing

**poemforsmallthings** (8): meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow

**whoisValensi** (8): I can literally never find it but this song reminds me of some old vine that was "Car Radio" except instead of the breakdown it was that cat keyboard that literally just meows. Because I can see someone doing that with this song and idk why.

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow

# My Answer When Someone Ask Me What Band Wrote The Album Tragic Kingdom

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This song is begging me to not call it forgettable but I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre getting a 5. At least you got a comment. Not everyone has that.

**bogo** (5): X

**followingfreeways** (5): just got the worst flashback to my junior year of high school this is cursed

**intheaftermath** (5): this was better when I was 12 and had no scope of music. I kind of forget how this one sounds when I'm not listening to it

**king bestie** (5): what i have about this song:

**TiltControls** (5): I prefer not having doubt. No Doubt, if you wish

**heysoupie** (4.5): forgettable

**CarlieScion** (4): sometimes the only thing I like about 21p songs are the production. This is not one of those songs

**emoforever1927** (4): like the lyrics just not the sound/composure of this song. TOP are great musicians though and i am still impressed by everything they do!

**Hulnia** (4): the intro/drop sounds like a kevin macleod song lol

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this sounds like an adore delano song

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Hmmmmmm something tells me we are in filler territory

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): this beat is great but they kinda waste it on a flat melody and unmemorable lyrics

**impla77** (3): oh good, this run is bringing my top average right down

**pig-serpent** (3): Boring trap drumbeat with extremely dated sounding synths blaring over it.  Sure

**whatsanillinois** (3): gucci mane type beat

**akanewasright** (2): this is so 2015 it hurts

**daythreeinmiami** (2): Even great albums sometimes have their filler. I always liked the outro though, so it gets a bonus point.

**Awkward\_King** (1): one thing i should never be in an emo rate is bored

somewhere between the months of march and may in 2015 I got this text from my best friend telling me I need to check out this band called 21 pilots. This friend was the reason im even into fob/panic and so I trusted her with my life ( in addition to thinking she was the coolest person in the school) and so i say okay and ask for songs to start with, she sends me screen and holding onto you which i ended up loving. This song was the first 'new' song I heard from them and it dropped like right as I was getting into them. i've been kinda mixed on it but every now and again Ill get an urge to get into it again

---

#The Few The Proud And The Emotional 

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): ATE ATE ATE

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Indie kings!

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): there‚Äôs a pun I want to make but it‚Äôs so weirdly specific that no one but me and maybe two other raters would get it

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this beat goes so hard on full volume that I remember my mom fearing her glasses would break when I would do the dishes playing the album

**intheaftermath** (10): I know this song is one of the more divisive ones but listening to it makes me feel cool so it can stay

**runaway3212** (10): this goes so hard


**steelstepladder** (9): I like how this song uses space

**jay** (8.5): that beat omfg

**Bandito21Dema** (8): because yay scream

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This song slaps. It‚Äôs dramatic in a good way. Just like me. Vocal editing is also well done and well put. Take notes Fall Out Boy.


**timothy444** (8): I hope this is meant to be scary

**-y-y-y-** (7.5): , I'm So Meta Even This Anthem

**nick1372** (7.5): this one's rough because it has an incredible atmosphere that would make it all come together if the parts weren't all mediocre. I like the concept of the first verse being Blurryface and the second being from Tyler's perspective but he needs to sign in a different voice or something to communicate it better. Also the pre-chorus in that distorted voice is awful and the chorus is mid.

**LilacDaffodils** (7.3): I used to walk down the halls of my middle school with my chromebook cracked open just enough to have music playing. I would lip sync to this song as I walked and I felt more confident than I have in the past 5 years.

**frogaranaman** (7): okayyyyyy The Weeknd‚Äôs Thursday mixtape intro

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): badly aged as soon as Stressed Out became a hit. I can‚Äôt tank this too much because 2016 me thought the uno reverse card on the second verse was genius and the "yeaaaah" in the end still is a moment

**xxipil0ts** (6.8): : looking back this was not as edgy as i remembered it to be. to be fair, i was 15.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): TOP‚Äôs audience:

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Miley voice: ‚Äúwhat does it mean what does it meannnnnn‚Äù

**isthesweetestcon** (6.5): the production is great but idk the lyrics

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): the song that made me give t√∏p a try because people i knew from the fall out boy bandom were hyping it up‚Ä¶. It took a little stockholming but I did get the hype at the time. Nowadays, idk it‚Äôs fine

# Truly Dont Have A Chance

**Uberpigeon** (6): hes a man AND emotional. wouah... we love a meninist!!

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (6): god this one was really going up for a second. but as soon as he shifted his voice to sound deeper (why does he have to sound like this), I was taken out. almost industrial. more a titus andronicus local business fella tbh

**bigbigbee** (5.5): Rotten To The Core outsold, I fear that villains won


**Stryxen** (5.5): OKAAYYY PURITY RING

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): This one‚Äôs too weird for my liking.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): One of those songs that sounds like it was made specifically to be used in edgy trailers, but it would probably serve that purpose well.

**moonagenightmares** (5): hypebeast youtube instrumental


**whoisValensi** (5): I once made a half-ass edited meme of this song where I just replaced like every end of each line with "I've been around" so it just went fucking "I'm fairly local... i've been around... i've seen the streets... i've been around..." but it wasn't even like a good job.

**throwaway-7650** (4.8): "I've seen the straights" yes we know you own a mirror tyler.

**BreadlessCrust** (4.5): ehh

**impla77** (4.4): why is this so boring when there is so much going on

**dreamingpastel** (4): 3edgy5me

**king bestie** (4): i showed this song to someone on a bus and it somehow convinced them to listen to the whole album so maybe i‚Äôm missing something

**plastichaxan** (4): As soon as he said ‚Äúyo‚Äù this song lost me

**welcome2thejam** (4): Disney/Nick rate gave me "to the core" PTSD so I'm just waiting for this song to clear

**akanewasright** (3.5): This chorus is so lame but like who the hell gave them these strings

**1998tweety** (3): the rap ruined this

**criestotheclicking** (3): imeviltotheCORE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): when i first heard this i misheard ‚Äúive seen the streets‚Äù as ‚Äúive seen the straights‚Äù and was so scared this was gonna turn into a straight dudebro allyship song


**apatel27** (2): Takes me back to high school with the emo cut boys

**Awkward\_King** (2): everyone who gives a low average this rate:

**hikk** (2): not the trap rap oh my god.. the chorus is better with the guitar but the rest is unbearable

**pig-serpent** (2): This is extremely 2012 levels of muted and flavorless reheated dubstep that's trying to sound much bigger than it can even come close to pulling off.  "This song will never be on the radio" yeah, because it's a much worse version of a big hit from 4 years prior, stop overselling yourself.

**seanderlust** (1.5): what? this was the lead single? ......why?

**CarlieScion** (1): the way this was one of my favourites back in 2016 and now I FUCKING hate it!!!!!! God so grating and the lyrics are UGLY

**Hulnia** (1): if only

**whatsanillinois** (1): this song feels racist to me. like he's trying to do a black voice or something idk. I originally heard the lyric as "I'm black like a funeral" and went full yikes mode

# Radio Rebel 

**CrimsonROSET** (9): making a song with the lyrics ‚Äòthey‚Äôll never play this song on the radio‚Äô the lead single ugh their MINDS
**starlitsuns** (8): (insert joke here about the "this song will never be on the radio" line being a prophecy)

**ImADudeDuh** (6): raise your hand if this was the first twenty one pilots song you heard this song on the radio üôã

**modulum83** (5.5): tyler i swear to god if you talk about your music not being on The Radio one more time i‚Äôm beating you over the head with the ukelele

**bogo** (5): "this song will never be on the radio" :surejan:

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The virgin "This song will never be on the radio" vs. the chad "Least this song is a smash"

**TiltControls** (3): I have a feeling this song has been played on the radio despite the lyrics. Or is this reverse-psychology? Clever band

**RandomHypnotica** (1): ‚Äúthis song will never be on the radio‚Äù thank fuck for that

I dont know who told brendon to make the worst song on the album the last one for the second album in a row but man, its sucks. I forget this song is on the album cause i never fucking stream it. I dont care for brendons frank sinatras cosplay. If this isnt bottom 5 by january ill put it there myself

Bad News its January and this isnt bottom 5, in fact it's gotten a few 11s even. This did way better than expected 

---

**celladonn** (11): I was going through it in 2016 and this song would make me cry lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This album has been so defined by Brendon‚Äôs piercing voice so it‚Äôs very fitting that the penultimate moment of the album would be him going silent and letting those melancholy (but still hopeful) trumpets take over as they herald in an uncertain horizon‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a nice way to end this run of high octane debauchery.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is CINEMA. PRODUCTION. his SORROW. he's PERFORMING. MUSIC!!!! REAL MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**CarlieScion** (10): my fourth most listened to song of 2016 üíÄ

**hikk** (10): i was a jazz band kid in high school i fear

**intheaftermath** (10): I used to be such a sucker for the pre-breakup P!ATD compilations set to this song. I didn't even ship the band members. I just liked the angst

**pig-serpent** (10): Easily the best Panic piano ballad.  I'll never forgive this sub if this scores lower than the title track.

**ScrtSuperhero** (10): - *almost* as good as DOAB, but misses by just a fraction

**indie\_fan\_** (9.6): this production is reminiscent of a disney/pixar finale song

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (8.8): good closer

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Say what you want but this absolutely slayed the community theatre audition panel. People were crying.

**runaway3212** (8): Brandon Urie should stop being a singer and just start doing these really good instrumentals

**seanderlust** (8): this title is giving me how corporations referenced 2020 during the first wave of COVID

**xxipil0ts** (8): : he's overdue for a ballad album.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): Brendon should use his lower register more it sounds great here

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): u kno what, i kinda dont mind the frank sinatra cosplay, he can pull it off pretty well

**king bestie** (7.5): the orchestra slays

**modulum83** (7.5): brendon urie is lucky this rate is happening in december cause he‚Äôs getting a massive In The Christmas Spirit bonus on these andy williams ass cuts. tis the season to be kind to the music of your youth :)

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): honestly a really good closer

**nt96** (7.5): 2020

**steelstepladder** (7.5): After an entire album of excess I'm glad we got something a bit more restrained to end the album on

**TiltControls** (7.5): Sometimes just having a straightforward track is enough

**heysoupie** (7.4): theater kid vibes

**criestotheclicking** (7): I used to really like this song but now it‚Äôs kind of just meh. Less than the sum of its parts somehow. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no sunshine‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no good times‚Äù = description of what it is like being a fan of Panic! nowadays

**ignitethephoenix** (7): someone with more musical theatre knowledge tell me what this would be an audition song for

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this persona works on DOAB (song) but doesn't work here

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's really funny to hear him fake that low voice

**poemforsmallthings** (6.7): I really don't think this song is As Terrible as most people do (maybe I've cried to it a couple times doesn't matter)

**isthesweetestcon** (6.5): sonically interesting and i like the style but it has nothing interesting to say and is lyrically boring. especially because it is a relatable topic i think he could have done a lot more with.

**-y-y-y-** (6): okay Brendon we get it you think you're Frank Sinatra and Freddie Mercury wrapped into one package, go flirt with another 16-year-old you obnoxious fuck

**1998tweety** (6): snooze

**starlitsuns** (6): so from my emo phase, I remember Panic! closers being very beautiful. like the closer on Too Rare to Live is absolutely beautiful, if I remember correctly it's just Brendon's vows to his wife with some autotune and it's fucking beautiful‚Ä¶ this one is not so beautiful, kinda mid actually.

**timothy444** (6): The only track here where he stops trying to be Freddie Mercury, and instead pretends to be Frank Sinatra. Interesting how Brendon can showcase his nice singing voice when he's not constantly shout-singing for the last 30 minutes

**bigbigbee** (5.5): we GET it you SING

**BreadlessCrust** (5): im not emotionally connected to PATD enough to feel the feels with this one

**CrimsonROSET** (5): he tried

**frogaranaman** (5): this sounds like the Nat King Cole xmas song

**jay** (5): giving kpop mini where they tack the ballad onto the end

**ktajlili** (5): Hmm...kind of a mixed bag. I think this could be an interesting closer, but it seems like everything Brendan writes just lacks depth. What exactly made the year so impossible? Maybe if there was SOME vulnerability shown here, this would have be really good.

**throwaway-7650** (5): idk if I should give this a 10 or tank it for being such an obvious homage to the artists that inspired this... so I'll compromise. 5 it is!

**welcome2thejam** (5): Why did he go all in on lounge???

**whatsanillinois** (5): father john misty ass song

**whoisValensi** (4.5): Another fucking boring end ballad here he fucking goes AGAIN with these fucking ballads. Ur not Frank Sinatra dude. But, I'd rather listen to this than "Dying in LA" or "The End of All Things"... It's the little things I guess.

**impla77** (4.3): what in the off off broadway

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (3.8): urie seems like the kind of guy who would be REALLY moved by the Father John Misty album from 2k22. he does NOT have the range to do a 1% of sinatra, but he could do 25% of FJM in a heartbeat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): BALLADPHOBICS GET HIS ASS

**akanewasright** (3): on an album where obnoxious bullshit is so clearly the appeal, being this fucking boring is honestly worse [2]

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (3): Holy shit this song feels twice the length that it is.

**Bandito21Dema** (3): another ehh

**bogo** (3): this is the most hilarious thing i have heard all week

**daythreeinmiami** (3): Is this Michael Bubl√©?

**Hulnia** (3): this could‚Äôve worked if they got someone who could actually sing to make it

**Uberpigeon** (3): its giving michael buble

**velvet-gloves** (2): a ballad for the sake of having a ballad. brendon urie would make a fine sinatra impersonator but this is a little too on the nose.

**apatel27** (1): Please you don't have the pipes for a Sinatra tribute

**emoforever1927** (1): just a total downer to me. his singing isfantastic though

**plastichaxan** (1): What is he trying to accomplish here he sounds so bad dsfljdfskh

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): my favorite Sufjan Stevens song! at the Disco

**dreamingpastel** (0): What in the stale Disney Oscar bait song is this?

this song is the closest modern panic! has gotten to tapping into the energy they had on *Fever* I took a liking to this song when it came out because it reminded me of 'Theres a good reason these tables are numbered ......' which was my favorite song on fever when this came out.

---

#Fucking Arsonist 

**akanewasright** (10): I‚Äôm sorry he was on his prime theater kid shit here‚Ä¶ like there‚Äôs a good reality where the kinky boots casting directors heard this and cast him on the spot

**Awkward\_King** (10): i do not care one bit this song is incredible. bops so hard, fun off the wall but still sensical lyrics. thought provoking subject matter. he fathered here

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): Everyone I show this song to seems to think that it‚Äôs too much but then again so am I, so‚Ä¶

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Lol this absolutely awful I love it.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): he works best when he just wants to be a silly disney villain

**flava** (10): just an insane song with a sweet little drive to it, perfectly camp, especially when the song describes him as Mike Love (hilarious considering Brendon had pushed every member of the band out by this point) and Brian Wilson. It‚Äôs all so succinctly meta

**hikk** (10): joker amv core

**mysario** (10): this gives "House of Wolves" by MCR but with horns

**pig-serpent** (10): Drummer gonna drum.  I really don't know why Brendon hasn't tapped back into this sound on the next two albums, even though I know it wouldn't turn out this good.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): that Mike Love/Brian Wilson line is such a sick burn

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): my favorite equation! at the Disco

**throwaway-7650** (10): BILLLIE?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this used to be my favorite song on the album when i was younger solely bc he says fucking in it

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (8.5): underrated and danceable

**king bestie** (8.5): how did the same man write viva las vengeance

**modulum83** (8.5): i have a bit of an unearned soft spot for this song because one of my best friends  said it reminds him of me and fuck it i never claimed not to be biased

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): why does this just remind me of the [hot feet song from the girl meets world and austin & ally crossover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpxuWjniFec)

**Bandito21Dema** (8): love to sing it

**dreamingpastel** (8): More of that big band jazz sound.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): if Aladdin was emo:

**welcome2thejam** (8): Honestly, giving an extra point or two because I'd rather he take big swings at big band and strike out on a full count than meh me like the last song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): wonder if the Beach Boys have heard this song

**-y-y-y-** (7.5): , this song is fun as shit, not super deep but that's fine

**1998tweety** (7): Loser=Lover >>>

**BreadlessCrust** (7): i fw the vibes

**celladonn** (7): Some of the stupidest lyrics on the album for sure but I won't act like I don't have fun

**isthesweetestcon** (7): it feels like brendon is trying to capture the feel of how panic used to be and he touches slivers of it on the verses but the choruses just feel too powerhouse and lackluster again‚Ä¶. but still more interesting than most of this album?

**xxipil0ts** (7): : white guy does jazz, kinda slaps?

**LilacDaffodils** (6.4): He is actually the Mike Love of panic incidentally

**heysoupie** (6.1): this song is bad. I feel like an asshole for even thinking this but like how many people who were still listening to this band in 2016 or w/e this album came out knew the beach boys reference before hearing this song? (I JUST learned about that whole part of music history bc I‚Äôm a non-white Millennial so I‚Äôd put myself in that category‚Ä¶except I‚Äôd felt I‚Äôd ‚Äúoutgrown‚Äù patd at the time of this album release so this I didn‚Äôt listen to it before this year.)

**daythreeinmiami** (6): If emo was around in 1950‚Äôs, this is what it would sound like.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I can tell that this came out in the wake of *The Great Gatsby (2013)*

**intheaftermath** (6): this was one of the first songs I ever voluntarily listened to that said "fuck". I felt SO mature listening to that in eighth-grade English class. Heck yeah, Brendon Urie said fuck

**nt96** (6): Azealia Bankrupt

**ScrtSuperhero** (6): - missed opportunity for a great circus themed music video! Upbeat and different from the rest of the album

**timothy444** (6): Sad that the f word wasn't used in a way where your gut drops. It's just there to fill out the empty space in the lyrics. Yawn

**criestotheclicking** (5.6): gee I wonder if Mike Love has heard this song? Also, this and Death of a Bachelor back-to-back is so tonally wonky. What tone is Brendon aiming for? The answer is probably that he wasn‚Äôt aiming for any kind of cohesive tone

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): the prechorus slays

**bogo** (5): "she said you're just like mike love but you wanna be brian wilson" did she lie

**cremeebrulee** (5): if ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô = ‚Äògenius‚Äô: setOccupation(‚Äòbrendon urie‚Äô, ‚Äòfucking arsonist‚Äô)

**frogaranaman** (5): Brendon Urie is the only person on earth who could write this song. not sure if that‚Äôs a good thing

#Rocket Scientisst

**velvet-gloves** (5): neither crazy nor genius

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Miss Emma Blackberry why is this your 2nd favorite Panic song

**jay** (4): hm.

**seanderlust** (4): "On the other hand, [Mike] Love is only really known for his lyrics, which can be simple and mediocre at times" :well:

**starlitsuns** (4): genius=me having Panic blocked for two years on Spotify before I started this rate

**Stryxen** (4): everything about this is so kpop and also bad

**TiltControls** (3): I can see why they wanted him for the Suicide Squad movie (derogatory)

**apatel27** (2.5): Gentrified New Orleans

**runaway3212** (2): this concept making no sense and the song also being terrible like pick a struggle

**Uberpigeon** (2): what??? shut the fuck up

**whoisValensi** (2): Why did I used to think this song was fucking godly what the FUCK.

**steelstepladder** (1): Welcome to the madhouse energy

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): is Brendan Urie the Joker?

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (1): "you're just like mike love, you'll never be brian wilson" is such an awful line across a bad made-for-disney live action special. again, it's another case of brendon TRYING to insert himself in a larger lineage of actual musical triumphs, but also completely missing the tragedy of that story, while also blatantly failing to acknowledge the psychedelia that makes wilson's work such a triumph. Instead he mines all of the wrong obsessive pedantic energy of the story. It's really dismaying to here it and genuinely feels so trite and callous. on top of that, the man this band NEVER warranted doing this kind of cornball "big band jazz that wants to be ska so BADLY" shit. god they coulda just put a bootleg oingo boingo or specials cut on here and we'd be ALL the better.

**whatsanillinois** (1): you're not even close to mike love dude

**darj** (0): this upset me

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): even discounting my bit as ‚Äúfourteen year old me‚Äù, I never liked this. It‚Äôs VLV before VLV.

**Hulnia** (0): god this man cannot sing to save his life. also comparing yourself to fucking mike love is hilarious, although i can‚Äôt say i disagree.

**impla77** (0): Shanspeare did a great video on the tortured artist trope! Watch that rather than listen to this

Man.

This song used to be first out and somehow it managed to claw its way up to the top of the bottom 10. Seeing this place above some of my favorites in the rate was cruel an unusual punishiment 
---

**dreamingpastel** (10): The little instrumental break after the second verse is nice, and I like that they bring it back for the bridge.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Haters can CHOKE! This is the right kind of edgy for me, there‚Äôs a note of intrigue and menace here that I found lacking in the rest of the 21P songs that‚Äôs so delicious.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): never have I ever been so disappointed in a movie but the soundtrack made wasting my time feels worthy

**jay** (10): one extreme

**moonagenightmares** (10): its not a phase mom this is who i really am!!!!11!

**mysario** (10): I used the phrase "all my friends are heathens" in the year 2023 already

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): HeaTEN!!! I want a witch house version of this so bad idc

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I had a phase when I was annoyed by how popular this song is. Now I'm past that. Also the trench hints in the mv omg

**throwaway-7650** (10): the bananis and avocadis voice works here

**celladonn** (9.5): sorry but it was a serve

**-y-y-y-** (9): , doesn't even feel like a tie-in, just a really fun sound about being a Bastard Man amidst a clan of Bastard Men

**Awkward\_King** (9): thinking about the lukeisnotsexy parody of this called "vegans".,, i miss 2010s british youtube

**cremeebrulee** (9): this song is unfortunately Not That Bad

**musical\_pyn** (9): this is so much better than I remember??

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): 3edgy5me but I can't bring myself to hate this

**daythreeinmiami** (8.5): This was one of the only good things to come out of Suicide Squad lol.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): unfortunately some of the tiktok edits I see with this song kinda eat

**heysoupie** (8.1): I weirdly like this song.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Waaaaaaay overplayed, but still enjoyable.

**DakotaTheFolfyBoi** (8): Pretty good pop tune

**plastichaxan** (8): This actually ate idc

**runaway3212** (8): this song makes no sense but it did make me feel very rad when I was like 14

**untitledmanuscript** (8): i prefer this song to most of Blurryface tbqh

**velvet-gloves** (8): better than half the songs on the album

**BreadlessCrust** (7.4): lowkey kinda based

**criestotheclicking** (7): vibey. Made a little cringe by the fans I guess (but 80% of t√∏p fandom is insisting you are and the band are so different from everyone else) but it‚Äôs a cool song and I like the breakdown. I almost made an attack on titan AMV about Levi to this song (my editing skills held me back)‚Ä¶ so make of that what you will.

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this matchup was just a mid off smh. Anyway, Heathens is at least tolerable so it wins this battle.

**emayzee** (7): it is pain living with the fact that one of my favorite bands will forever have a suicide squad song with a music video featuring jared leto clips as one of their biggest hits

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this song is a lot more boring then I recall

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this is the first time i‚Äôm hearing this but why is it kinda‚Ä¶good

**nt96** (7): 20 year old me would've zero'd this in a heartbeat because of how fake deep it sounds, but I'm different now. I give this a seven because I now have nostalgia of how 20 year old me would've zero'd this in a heartbeat because of how fake deep it sounds.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): this is kinda the sound i expected from TOP

**ScrtSuperhero** (7): - embarrassing but this song kinda went off

**seanderlust** (7): real twisted cycle path vibes here

**Stryxen** (7): bad, but good. But bad

**bigbigbee** (6.5): THIS IS KATANA‚Ä¶SHES GOT MY BACK‚Ä¶SHE COULD CUT ALL OF YOU IN HALF WITH ONE SWORD STROKE, JUST LIKE MOWING THE LAWN  

(slightly too long pause) 

I WOULD ADVISE NOT GETTING KILLED BY HER‚Ä¶HER SWORD TRAPS THE SOULS OF ITS VICTIMS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Tbh I don‚Äôt really get what about this song makes people hate it so much more than other Twenty One Pilots songs. Like yeah it‚Äôs overwhelmingly edgy but like‚Ä¶that‚Äôs just who they are.

**intheaftermath** (6.5): I've never really loved this one. It's fine. It does what it needs to do, but I'll never actively go out and listen to it.

**MassiveThief** (6.5): all my friends are creepers we explode

**1998tweety** (6): its alright

**Bandito21Dema** (6): I like the lyrics

**frogaranaman** (6): that part where the they say "watch it" and the guitar does the noise? makes the song worth it

**king bestie** (6): i wish i thought this was worse

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.8): this was the first song I heard in the rate that didn't piss me off. It made me...excited to hear |-/. no he can't rap (painfully white), but the whole execution is "fine", if not just anthemic in a postmodern anonymous manner.

**timothy444** (5.5): I actually used to really like this but listening to it now unlocks a whole bucket of cringe and over-the-top but PG edginess in me. It's certainly not as bad as Panic!'s cover of Bohemian Rhapsody but jeez you can absolutely tell it's for the Suicide Squad movie. I got to say it though, the part where it goes to an instrumental after you hear the words "Watch It" is kinda chilling

**apatel27** (5): It's not as bad as people say it is

**bogo** (5): we live in a society

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i‚Äôm so happy this isn‚Äôt gonna lower my blurryface average

**whatsanillinois** (5): : Lietoc: i think its super endearingly white

**modulum83** (4.3): all my friends are he/theys take it slow

**hikk** (4): boring but at least it's not as horrible as some of their other stuff

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): I hate this one too, but it‚Äôs a matter of principle

**welcome2thejam** (4): The major saving graces are that deep noise going CHNG-CHNG and (WATCH IT)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): im not listening to this

**TiltControls** (2): I wasn't a huge fan of the track initially but I think overplay fully killed it for me

**whoisValensi** (2): Oh the misery, every single person is my enemy.

**akanewasright** (1): the fact that this might not be bottom 5 says something about society‚Ä¶ something very bad

**CarlieScion** (1): roxie I hate u for including this

**isthesweetestcon** (1): if top opened for gathering of the juggalos this would be that song

**pig-serpent** (1): Boring nothing of a song that starts nowhere and ends nowhere.  I also don't remember those digital harmonies, but they are one of the worst things I've ever heard.

**steelstepladder** (1): OH THE MISERY!!!! EVERYONE IS INDULGING IN HEATHENRY!!!

**nick1372** (0): the worst song in their entire discography. WHY is there a high-pitched backup vocal harmonizing every single word???

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): never watched this movie

**RandomHypnotica** (6.950): you had 0 reason to put this in the main rate and you know it

**runaway3212** (6.000): why didnt we rate Sucker For Pain

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.500): cultural reset (derogatory)

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.000): an incredible advertisement for Radiohead's Creep.

**dream\_fighter2018** (4.000): it would‚Äôve been so much crueller if you had put Panic!‚Äôs Bohemian Rhapsody cover vs Twenty One Pilot‚Äôs cover of Cancer. Two awful covers, both of which are considerably worse than Heathens. The covers themselves feel like the worst that both bands have to offer, like parodies of the bands covering the songs. Compared to those two, Heathens almost feels like the original Bohemian Rhapsody.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.750): roxie you are evil for this btw

**welcome2thejam** (3.000): Roxie... why...

**bogo** (3.000): not this

**modulum83** (2.150): this movie ruined pop culture for a couple years. anyway if we rated purple lamborghini i would given it a 10. hell if we rated sucker for pain i would have given it a ironic 10. wait there‚Äôs a grimes song on here ?!?!?!?!

**whoisValensi** (1.500): The fact you put this in the main rate is why I am going to kick the shit out of you one day, Roxie.

So fucking much of this album ( and the fob album) is tied to me being on the bus durring marching band season freshman year. Another 11 of mine Im not sure why this was the song I latched on but i did. Really sad to see this one go, as its one of my favorites, but i guess it was just too,,,,,polarizing 

---

# I think you guys should tutor each other 

**rotating3Dtext** (8): domingo en fuego is NOT correct spanish, I'm so mad

**criestotheclicking** (7): decent song. Taught me a bit of Spanish.

# Is now a better brother/ son

**CrimsonROSET** (10): maybe the deepest song on the album actually?

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I can't get enough of that bass in what I think it's the bridge, it's just so good

**Stryxen** (9): terrible and also amazing

**-y-y-y-** (8): , falling off a little bit due to the voice effects but still enjoying it a lot

**Uberpigeon** (8): i thought he was saying help me four eyes

**akanewasright** (7): ending of the song genuinely rules, even if I could take or leave the first half

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): This isn‚Äôt polarizing so much as forgettable.

**runaway3212** (7): DOWN THOSE STAIRS - me kicking 3mo haters

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): ‚ÄúTyler and Joseph, what is one of the things that gerrymandering did to America?‚Äù

**BreadlessCrust** (6.8): banger!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): They kinda had me up until the bridge which is just a ???? of choices.

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Always forget this song is here

**1998tweety** (6): shes alright

#Needs Help Down the Stairs

**pig-serpent** (5.5): Despite the title, my feelings on this song are a pretty flat "meh"

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): I hope this has a high controversy score because that would make it‚Ä¶ polarizing


**frogaranaman** (5): why‚Äôd he go latino in the middle just to say the word ‚Äúfuego‚Äù

**modulum83** (5): what the fuck is going on in here tyler. i‚Äôm taking away your goddamn Ableton privileges.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Why do they always have to sing in weird accents

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5): inoffensive? i think?

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): polarized shades are good

**apatel27** (4): It's an anthem song but doesn't seem very anthemic

**jay** (4): hm

**dreamingpastel** (3): Could use some more screaming.

**heysoupie** (3): The ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where you are!‚Äù at 2:24 might be the worst few seconds on this whole rate and sounds vaguely like a Cold War Kids song but like, bad.

**whatsanillinois** (3): i don't mind it but the production is way overdone

**CarlieScion** (2): the biggest nothing-burger of lyrics in this whole rate mayhaps

**throwaway-7650** (1): well I sure do hope this song is polarizing enough for it to be day 1

**Awkward\_King** (0): tyler joseph originated the language of szanese on this one

# Zara Larson Hit List
