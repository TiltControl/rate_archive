https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/gll3dy/the_2019_main_pop_girls_rate_day_3_well_its_lover/

Welcome to Day 3, THE FINALE. 

We will begin revealing  here at **4pm EST**. We will be revealing tracks #20 - #1, and the final 7 bonus rate songs

Join us here in this thread as we post total scores and comments for each song, and also in the plug, which we have revived for this reveal, located **[here](https://plug.dj/popheads/)**

--- 

We had 236 amazing participants, all of which can be found **[here](https://pastebin.com/7MiNHmdZ)**. This makes this rate the most participated in rate ever on /r/popheads. 

In addition to that fun fact, here are some additional notes to take into account before we begin revealing: 

The average score was 7.389, that means that anything below this sucks, and anything above it is actually good. 

The average controversy score was 2.021, that means that anything below it is ~~a song by Ariana, and anything above it is a song by Taylor~~ a non-controversial placement, and anything above it was a controversial song.

biggest trainwreck of relationship ive seen in years. messy as shit, loved every second of it. they also made sure to document every time they went out by paps, they wanted to have those pictures for the memories

---

**fadedblue09** (11): Birthed 2 iconic albums and her biggest era to date.

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): literally gave us the term "big dick energy" what more could you want

**anagalisgv** (10): because of this i had to learn who pete davidson is

**anothertown** (10): All you have to do is look at the relationship timeline to know this is a 10 https://twitter.com/nicolewboyce/status/1006654022412128256

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): thank u next

**jimmy345960** (10): IM GONNA BE HAPPY HAPPY

**leviswift13** (10): girl this was so needlessly messy. who in their right MIND names a song after someone they've only been with for a few months!! the humor! the range!

**lilacsweetener** (10): a yup that would definitely count as genuine controversy, it felt like it had been ages since a celeb relationship really captivated people. And she had to release a whole ass song to get control of her narrative again. I have no clue how these celebs jump from person to person within weeks but they all do it...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): gets a 10 solely for the irony of naming a song after him and then ending their engagement like a month later

**gabcac** (9.5): it was a rideeeee

**LeninaCrowne94** (9.5): Sis dodged a bullet

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8.5): it was a RIDE

**bespectacIed** (8): Her worst boyfriend but it partially inspired her best album (Sweetener) so he gets props for that

**Agusarg** (7): Pete davidson is a good song idc

**wavingwolves** (7): at first it was funny i'll admit but it definitely got tiring and heavy

**meiscool132** (6.5): I don't see it as a controversy as much I do a weird relationship that culminated in two amazing albums and entertainment for the summer

**twat\_brained** (6.2): I was never expecting the two to wed, but why is this considered controversial? She's not dating someone a decade removed from her like Liam Payne and Britney Spears are doing. They weren't great for each other but I don't understand how this isn't just another example of a celebrity couple that didn't work out. Like Camila and Shawn will do when they no longer help the other sell records.

**1998tweety** (6): meh

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): Jesus this was a freaking saga, wasn't it? To quote Tove Lo "You're better off, I'm glad that he's gone."

**hadea0090** (5): idk much about them tbh but that photo with a lollipop and her talking about his dick was....something

**ManofOranges** (5): I honestly still have a hard time believing that she and him even dated in the first place. It feels like a fever dream.

**runaway3212** (5): I honestly just wanted her to be happy with him.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): pete davidson is funny

**ImAMessyBitchDuh** (3): jesus christ they were annoying together

**mudkip1** (3): remember when he was suicidal and wouldnt go on snl so then everybody on twitter starting blaming ariana for it even though theyd been broken up for like 3 weeks?

**puberty1** (3): the song pete davidson is a 11 but yall are not ready for this conversation

**ReallyCreative** (3): I didn't care when they dated, but Pete being bitter after the fact is kinda interesting I guess?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (1): A fucking mess. I remember liking Pete Davidson when he was part of SNL a few years ago. Now I kinda low-key cringe when I see him on SNL? He's still funny but it's hard to brush away the Ariana past with Pete.

**radiofan15** (1): I'm sorry but this whole situation, even if it comes from a very dark spot of her, is just hilarious in hindsight.

**vhqv1997** (1): How was this a controversy, it was just pop stans being nosy for no reason. Pete is kinda gross but if Ariana was too much of a dumbass to not see that, that was her business bros

wanderingimpromptu3: Ariana is crushing it. Billie has 36% of her album left, Lizzo 33%, Taylor 22% but Ariana has a whopping 50%. 

Of her songs left, imagine is definitely the weakest.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The amount of times I replayed this song because it's so infectious and catchy. Victoria Monet and Ariana have a lot of chemistry in this song.

**mayolizard** (10): omg smash idc idc ariana bisexual

**Mysario** (10): HAPPY TWENTY-BI-TEEN!!! The music video for this is so adorable and this track is so cute, I remember a lot of people didn't like this when it came out but it's probably definitely my favourite of Ari's from that era. She the chico!!!

**cremeebrulee** (9): i like this. it’s a fun song to sing along to. the MV is kinda cringe but i pretend it doesn’t exist lol

**puberty1** (9): this is a cute song y'all are just biphobic

**alwayswords** (8.5): this bops idc

**Mazike** (8.1): underrated

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): It's an undeniably catchy bop. 'Outta Here with that FUUUUCKery.' This should have been more successful than 7 Rings

**J\_Toe** (8): wasn't this song released on April 1?

**Nickl00** (8): it’s not trying to be serious and I love it

**waluigiest** (8): biconic lol

**wasian-invasion** (8): aw what a cute collab between friends

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): ok honestly this is fun as hell, and i love a good victory lap

**meiscool132** (7.5): took a while but I like it now, even more for what it is, just a song for fun

**bandnitos** (7): meh

**cleen\_claire** (7): this one's fun i like it

**leviswift13** (7): cuz her name is aubrey !!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): a Cute friendship bop good for them.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): it's cute, sue me

**runaway3212** (7): It's pretty middle of the road for me.

**Tolk1en** (7): idc idc I love their mindset.

**vayyiqra** (7): stan crony capitalism (yuh)

**WeastofEden44** (7): I like this song more than most but I almost never listen to it so...

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I don’t think this song is that bad tbh, it’s cute and fun and supposed to be low effort

**wardrum5** (6.5): It's kinda catchy but I would never intentionally listen to it

**eeveefan01** (6): Its cute

**hadea0090** (6): it exists

**Johnnytoby** (6): tbh dont even know when victoria or ari are singing

**ManofOranges** (6): Completely forgot that this song existed. After listening to it though, I'm not really surprised. It's nice but it's just inoffensive, it doesn't offer me something that I couldn't get from so many other songs. Hell, even some of Ariana's own songs can be good substitutes for this, I think.

**nick1372** (6): It was fine but I forgot about it immediately

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): Pass go, do NOT collect $200.

**materialqirl** (5): for some reason i thought this was boring

**nootnoot781** (5): i prefer cluedo

**wavingwolves** (5): ''i like women and men'' yes me too bitch

**jayjaysortagay** (4): I don't like this, Victoria Monet is not a good singer and is riding Ariana's clout wave so hard.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): wow two strong black women!/s

**AnimationJava** (3): An interesting follow-up single to 7 rings.

**fadedblue09** (3): Wat is dis hunny? Everything about this song is atrocious.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Ariana must have been bitten by a radioactive hot take during this era because she gained the ability to generate controversy with even the most boring of music.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): i literally forgot this song came out

**ReallyCreative** (3): it's like the parts of Sweetner/thank u next I didn't like rolled up into one half-assed song

**bespectacIed** (2): insert Victoria monet genius meme

**cashewconstellation** (2): Ew

**FluffyNobody** (2): this is honestly terrible

**pearllouise** (2): Ariana bisexual and black. We stan a minority.

**skargardin** (2): no

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): the extra point five is just because i can't score this the same as the bad guy and good as hell remixes

**1998tweety** (1): Trash

**ggodisawomann** (1): this song is so fucking bad, I can't believe they released it

**ImADudeDuh** (1): FLOP!

**Kromorei** (1): this song is awful i wish i could 0 it

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): antitrust laws snapped

**nooodisaster** (1): i mean it makes sense why it was released on april 1st...

**radiofan15** (1): I don't think Ariana could have made a lazier song even if she was sleepwalking... I mean, this sounds AI-generated.

It struggles a bit with some jumpy lyrics, but wow this has some amazing visualizations. The traffic lights line has become a meme in the Swiftie community, and the chorus is so… *chef’s kiss* it’s amazing. 

The production is calming, catchy, and it is truly one of the best highlights of Lover. 

---

**LeninaCrowne94** (11): The true gem of Lover. All Too Well’s cool older sister.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Catchy and emotional, Old Taylor-style bop

**bespectacIed** (10): "Baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name" proof of Taylor's songwriting genius in this album when she actually cares enough to show it

**CarlieScion** (10): why is this not touted as the lyrical peak on this album????

**cremeebrulee** (10): the best song on the album. all too well’s older sister and hopefully it becomes just as loved as well. once again taylor does an amazing job of filling a song with small personal details while also making it relatable to the masses. there are places i avoid because of lost love and to hear it in song form it so validating. i love it.

**cyborglilith** (10): iconic

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Before Lover was released, I claimed Track 9 not knowing what Cornelia Street would be about and I am so glad I stanned the right song. You can hear how personal Taylor was in this song. With a string of failed publicized relationships, you can feel Taylor's fear of losing her lover again here. The "I'd never walk Cornelia Street again" lyric gave this song an emotional punch. We associate our memories with a certain place and if it ended badly, it's probably hard to shake off those memories when you see that place.

**FluffyNobody** (10): This is so relatable. Being happier than you've ever been, and bracing yourself for the end of it, and for the heartbreak you would experience.

**george\_kaito** (10): the all too well of the album, her voice on the "i get so mystified by how this city screams your name" line gives me chills

**ImADudeDuh** (10): and babY I get MystiFIED by how this. CITY SCREAMS YOUR NAME

**leviswift13** (10): another contender for an 11. this is the love child of delicate and all too well. the groove is emotional and sincere. the lyrics paint such a vivid, personal story. you can feel the emotion in "i hope i never lose you"

**lilacsweetener** (10): This grew on me until I absolutely adored it. The first bridge has me on the edge of my seat every time, as if one day she actually won’t turn around when he finally calls. The second bridge brings tears every time as she reflects on just how long she has been in love. The storytelling is phenomenally heartfelt and vulnerable. Sonically/lyrically a sequel to Delicate, which is only a good thing. A song based around saying goodbye to a house she made a home in a hugely important phase of her personal life. Wow.

**meiscool132** (10): this song gives me the same range of emotions as a good movie and that's a feat

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): delicate teas

**SFbby** (10): Someone tell me where her apt on Cornelia Street in NYC is so I can stalk it

**twat\_brained** (10): catch me graffiting Cornelia street for being the street where Taylor's heart was broken

**waluigiest** (10): fantastic - this song blends the neat writing and wonder that early Taylor Swift was loved for and marries it to the pop production and styling that has given her success recently. It’s this album’s Delicate and it deserves recognition!

**wasian-invasion** (10): ugh I need to go back to greenwich village and put a witty selfie with a street sign on my story

**xosam** (10): THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM PERIOD. Ugh obsessed with this its just a super cute & emotional song

**franch** (9.9): just that perfect breakup song and ode to the West Village at the same time...

**1998tweety** (9.5): Another song that took a second to grow on me, but now that it did, good Lorde it hits. The chorus is so vibey, I love it.

**Kromorei** (9.5): the best song on the album

**mms82** (9.5): amazing song and so hits on that I love it here but I would never go back here if I lose you that's so real

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): I love proper nouns

**runaway3212** (9.5): The real track 5 of Lover

**akanewasright** (9): People talk about how Taylor uses so many specifics in her lyrics that her songs feel real and, thus, universal. This song is a prime example of that. Maybe I’m biased toward this song though... I once got drunk and texted lyrics from this song to someone. That was a very bad idea, but I felt so connected to the song that I thought it expressed what I was feeling better than I could.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): Took me a while to get into this song but it's actually really beautiful and now reminds me a lot of old Taylor.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Taylor’s bread and butter right here. One of the best on here

**Jimmy345960** (9): Taylor track 9s the new underrated tracks????? But anyway I love the story she takes on this track.

**lapascalia** (9): She really captured that specific feeling really well, love it!

**ManofOranges** (9): I've never actually listened to the lyrics for this song but I think they're supposed to be sad so maybe it's for the best! Anyways the song is good!

**patcheso8** (9): this continues to grow on me.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9): This is a really good song, what the Archer was aspiring to be

**wavingwolves** (9): i resent this song because i'm lonely and bitter

**Stryxen** (8.5): in love taylor is the only taylor

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): I really love this song. It's fairly simple but it's so incredibly effective

**radiofan15** (8.2): This should have been Track 5...

**eeveefan01** (8): I would say this should of been 'Track 5'

**ggodisawomann** (8): very wispy feeling

**hikkaru** (8): delicate with better lyrics but more boring production/melody

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): solid tune

**nick1372** (8): Wildest Dream's spiritual successor

**nooodisaster** (8): The storytelling here is so intimate I could see it clearly from listen one.

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's a good ballad, and a standout on an album with too many "just okay" slower songs

**untutorable** (8): this one was a grower for me and tbh i didn't expect it to ever be one of my favorites off the album but here we are lads

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): It's nice. Like, it's as if Taylor said "Okay, we did it with Getaway Car, let's make it a tad bit more bland"

**AnimationJava** (7): Some of the strongest songs from Lover are the upbeat ballads/chill & slow songs. They're going to age like fine wine mark my words.

**cleen\_claire** (7): I always forget this exists but it's real good

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Touching, but kind of grating a lot of the time.

**Nickl00** (7): it’s sweet but kinda forgettable

**pearllouise** (7): This song makes me corny

**skargardin** (7): cute if a little bit uneventful

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): It's good, but doesn't come close to her other great ballads like Last Kiss and ATW. The bland production is the biggest culprit here.

**vayyiqra** (7): It's kind of cute and I like Taylor's storytelling kind of songs, though she cannot be serious with the line "we bless the rains".

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Delicate rehash? Sure, girl, but no one really needs it.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): it's catchy but that's about it

**bandnitos** (6): everyone calling this the next delicate is delusional

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is kinda boring

**Mysario** (5.7): skip

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): Look, if Taylor doesn't want Cornelia Street again i'll have it cause that place looks divine

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (5.5): why do i feel like swifties are going to push this mediocre track into the top 10

deleted: **anothertown** (5): I once saw Sheldon from big bang theory in the village. I do not think it was on cornelia street though

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): Does anyone listen to this song if not listening to the album? Is this anyone's favorite song? Genuine questions.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This song is low-key hilarious, the way she sings “I’ll never walk Cornelia Street again” has strong “I am NEVER ordering from Papa John’s again” energy. The story she’s telling is really uninteresting though.

**jayjaysortagay** (5): the cringy nostalgia lyrics are giving me Ed Sheeran album cut

**mayolizard** (5): boring

**rhyneston3** (5): Ok no I'm not a Swiftie yet

**alwayswords** (4.5): :sleeping_accomodation:

**Kanne\_** (4): not bad at all, just meh

**puberty1** (4): so so skippable

**frogaranaman** (3): this is the Joker (2019, dir. Todd Phillips) stairs scene but for annoying pop stans

**Awkward\_King** (2): i do want cornelia street to end

**hadea0090** (2): I can't stand the chorus.

**eeveefan01** (11): Ariana was a head of time when she released this smash, we all need space now.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Such a bop, and I will never understand why this wasn't the third single instead of BUWYGIB.

**Austine567** (10): why wasn't this a single?

**bespectacIed** (10): Cute, fun, YOUTHFUL. Ari is the supreme mindless relatable popstar

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Such a shame Ariana considered this as the worst song on the album. SMH Ari, clean your ears because this is a bop.

**franch** (10): just pop perfection.

**george\_kaito** (10): why didnt the good sis make this a single... cruel summer teas

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I love when Ari lets her theatre side out, and the melody of this song could have been lifted straight from a musical. This is to *thank u, next* what “Greedy” was to *Dangerous Woman*, the slightly left-of-center pop perfection single that got away.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): everything about this is perfect. Love the restrained vocals that grow with the music and beautifully match the bouncy production.

**Johnnytoby** (10): inspired me to get NASA merch

**lapascalia** (10): Love Shangela in the beginning, this song is fun but also keeps it real.

**leviswift13** (10): BOP WHY WAS THIS NOT A SINGLE IT'S CALLED HOMOPHOBIA LUV

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember when I first listened to this album, this was the first song that I hadn't already heard that clicked away with me. I like the hook and I think it's cute and calling a song where she needs space "NASA" is like a cute little joke or whatever.

**mayolizard** (10): smash smash smash

**mudkip1** (10): b a w p

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This honestly should’ve been a single wtf Ari

**nick1372** (10): an absolute BOP. Conceptually, her tightest song ever.

**nooodisaster** (10): "IMMA NEED SPACE." We stan relatable and underrepresented topics in pop music, and woah did this connect with me. This isn't bitter or angry about wanting distance, she doesn't want to break up, it's just like, let's have our own lives and a lil alone time every now and then and why aren't there more songs about that?? Couple that with imo the catchiest earworm of the album, and a Shangela cameo? Broooooooooo.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): surely this song must be what really motivated jfk to go to the moon

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): damn this slaps, the single that SHOULD HAVE BEEN

**untutorable** (10): bonus points for shangela

**waluigiest** (10): this deserved to be a single. It’s catchy and fun and I was radicalized the first time I heard her spell NASA

**xosam** (10): An absolute bop, was a contender for my 11, its just such a happy song that puts you in a good mood <3

**cashewconstellation** (9.5): Amazing

**materialqirl** (9.3): invented space

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): if the rest of the album were on this level i'd understand the hype

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): I guess when the stars align you make like your future and planet out

**ladililn** (9): Last album Ariana was God Herself and now she’s the entire fucking universe. I think AG6 might be Ragnarok??

**puberty1** (9): idk why but i used to skip this one when the album was released. now it's one of my favorites tho

**rsmitty99** (9): Come thru Shangela! Haha! Love this song. Super fun

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I almost wish this one was slightly faster

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): fun and infectious!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): cute but not a personal fav

**twat\_brained** (8.7): is there some euphemism I'm missing? Did NASA even sign off on this? I like how it sounds I just don't understand the metaphor

**akanewasright** (8.5): Basic as fuck, but I don’t care. I love it. Also - THE ARMPIT CALLBACK!

**bulforster** (8.5): I don't really get why people say this should've been a single but it's a cute song.

**radiofan15** (8.1): Kacey did it better...

**anagalisgv** (8): really wishing i didn't have so much space rn

**bandnitos** (8): this kinda got stale but it still goes off

**cleen\_claire** (8): queen of introverts!!!!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): This following up 'needy' does show some layers to the album, but it's also not as good as 'needy' so not exactly sure if it's a good choice. Maybe the two should've been swapped?

**ggodisawomann** (8): bop

**Jimmy345960** (8): Great Track

**Kromorei** (8): this song is highkey a fav. rly solid.

**meiscool132** (8): mood

**Nickl00** (8): one if her catchiest hooks but it just kinda ends

**pearllouise** (8): Bonus points for Trixie's hostage Shangela for providing guest vocals on this track.

**rhyneston3** (8): Fun & fresh

**Stryxen** (8): the rhythm is so boppable

**wasian-invasion** (8): queen of putting a man on the moon

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8): honestly deserved to be a single

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): It just doesn't quite hit the levels I want it to, and it slows down towards the end for no real reason, but it's impressive. After imagine and needy though, I'm getting a little tired of this sound.

**FluffyNobody** (7.5): this is undeniably infectious (plus anticipated the whole social distancing thing)

**hawksband** (7.5): worst song on the album

**Kanne\_** (7.5): didn't age well for me, liked it more at release

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I love the chorus but the verses are lacking a little

**runaway3212** (7.5): The verses are great, the chorus is pretty boring

**WeastofEden44** (7.5): I loved this song when the album came out but it's aged a bit

**AnimationJava** (7): A fun song! Made every girl and gay purchase NASA merch so I hope the US Government is thanking her.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Song is a bop. Can't help but feel the space metaphors are getting a little mixed up though.

**CarlieScion** (7): the whiplash of having needy and nasa right next to each other lmao

**cremeebrulee** (7): this song could’ve scored higher easily but it loses me with ariana’s lack of enunciation

**Evanbrooks324** (7): a bop but very basic

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Verses > Chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (7): put me with all the other social distancing comments

**vhqv1997** (7): Just want to quote this excellent shitpost here so that more people can see it: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheadscirclejerk/comments/b2a0x0/to_the_tune_of_nasa/

**1998tweety** (6.5): Shangela ate here, but the song gets kind of annoying at points. It also bops at some points though so I'm mixed.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this bopped when it came out but it doesn't quite hit the same now

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this song has exactly one idea and it's to appear in instagram captions

**anothertown** (6): it’s fine, not one of her best choruses ever made

**J\_Toe** (6): Is it good? Is it bad? Who cares! Are you having fun listening to it?

**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): this was the hardest song to give a score to. i can't form a consistent opinion on it at all.

**skargardin** (6): something about this doesn't really hit like it used to a year ago

**vayyiqra** (6): I'ma need spice me when my parents have me over for dinner I thought Ariana was literally just talking about how needy she is and now she needs the opposite? Alright, sure. A social distancing anthem! Tbh I just like the part where she says "N-A-S-A".

**wavingwolves** (6): social isolation anthem

**agentofscranton** (5): points for the whole song being one big space pun but this is kinda just there

**hadea0090** (5): The space metaphor is cute but production wise it's nothing special

**lilacsweetener** (5): This was an early fave but I grew bored of it quick. The chorus is dull but I appreciate the different subject matter.

**plantp0wer** (5): en ay es ay.. i’m not into the chorus but it is the quarantine mood

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.5): This song is hilarious

**AlbinoAbsol** (3): The hook feels reductive and not catchy at all, and the production and Ariana's voice doesn't seem to fit together.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Step aside, I'm back again, So hype, so lit, adrenaline

**fadedblue09** (2): It’s cute, I guess, but it’s super generic? Also those space-themed lyrics were super lame and again, the sentiment has been done better by the other tracks. I’ve heard somewhere that this is Ari’s least fave song on the album and honestly? She’s right and she should say it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): bad chorus

**Mysario** (1.3): the Apollo 13 of her discography

**kappyko** (1): /u/selegend [+3]

Surprised this didn’t make top 10 tbh, this is the closest to a pure pop song like DW from this album, and it barely made day 3. There’s a subtle beauty to this song in the fact that it could be put into pretty much any era Ari has had and it would fit well. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7sL_O10D7w

---

**alwayswords** (10): deserved to be a single

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): 'Don't want you in my bloodline' is an extremely underrated bar.

**cremeebrulee** (10): imagine a world where this was the third single :/ regardless this song is a BANGER and i love that she’s basically saying “i just wanna fuck around, it’s not that srs” a vibe fr!!!

**Evanbrooks324** (10): the best upbeat song on the album, an absolute bop and I live for the lyrics, probably my second favorite on the album

**gannade** (10): we love ari appropriating rihanna culture

**ggodisawomann** (10): I could fight this bitch for not putting this on her live album

**hadea0090** (10): horns + bop = yes from me

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a major bop that deserved to be a single if Ariana wanted more singles from this album.

**lapascalia** (10): I wish this had been a summer single!

**mayolizard** (10): this reminds me of spring / summer and deserved to be single it's so much fun teehee

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song has so much energy for subject matter so bleak and sad. I’m digging it.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this slaps

**rhyneston3** (10): I love this! 10 yuh's out of 10

**RosaPalms** (10): why on earth this didn't get a nicki feature and single treatment is beyond me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): This is lowkey her best song tbh I love the trumpets

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): best song on the album, change my mind

**LeninaCrowne94** (9.8): I'm obsessed with this like you all are with Cruel Summer. Should've been a single

**Kromorei** (9.5): i'd let ari give me a blood transmitted disease for making this

**rsmitty99** (9.5): I'm a simple man. I love Side to Side. This is her close 1st cousin and it still slaps. -0.5 points for being something she's done before. But I ain't mad.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): Great song, goes hard & insanely catchy

**1998tweety** (9): Okay this actually bops, she may have made a point here. Robbed single.

**agentofscranton** (9): i'm always a slut for a good trumpet

**anagalisgv** (9): forgot how hard this song goes

**bespectacIed** (9): Those horns are what takes the song to the top

**cleen\_claire** (9): uh oh!!!!! banger alert!!!!

**dreamingoutloud92** (9): Ok, she’s a bop

**fadedblue09** (9): Whew! After a couple snoozefests the album picks up once more. This is what NASA wishes it was. Also, can we all stop comparing it to the garbage known as Side to Side? Thank you.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): something about the prechorus sounds so late 2000s to me? The "love me love me baby are you down can you let me know" part

**pearllouise** (9): Okay I'm not gonna lie.

**Stryxen** (9): this was the song I latched onto on my first listen because of the stupid fun instrumental

**waluigiest** (9): okay but imagine society if this had been a song of the summer 2019 along with old town road and sucker.....

**wasian-invasion** (9): stupid boy think that I need him

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): issa bop

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): i know its something everyone said too many times last summer but this deserved some sort of promo or acknowledgement from Ari and it never came

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8.8): i was obsessed with this when it came out but it doesn't hit as hard now. still love it tho!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): And here we go with another Ari x Max Martin collab. The pre-chorus kinda reminds me of the hook of Post Malone's Better Now

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I love how even the simple sex bops on the album are written with such vulnerability and originality. "Don't want you in my bloodline" is such a great way of phrasing DTF, and "I ain't lookin' for my one true love · Yeah, that ship sailed away" is a really poignant moment that stays.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): An appreciated switch up in style and sound, my biggest issues are with the mixing, Ariana's vocals feel really muffled in places and it really prevents the song from being a smash. It could also use a stronger bridge section.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): the pre chorus is amazing and the rest of the song holds up well

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): side 2 side sonically but I'll be damned if it doesn't slap

**Mysario** (8.4): this song is great but I feel like she overdoes too much in it vocally for it to be super enjoyable

**Anthony-Vince** (8): It's good but I think it's a tad overhyped. There's something about the instrumental that feels kind of empty.

**FluffyNobody** (8): the beat is literal fire, but I find the chorus really grating at times

**frogaranaman** (8): sorry Ariana, unlike you I want a man to c-m in me

**jayjaysortagay** (8): one of the best choruses on the album, the rest is a bit meh though

**Jimmy345960** (8): Damn she goes off on this one. This album is killer.

**ManofOranges** (8): Arguably the first "bop" on the album if you're talking in terms of danceability. I think it's good, I think it's still competent, I just don't like it as much as the songs that came before it.

**meiscool132** (8): it's sort of weird but in a great way

**untutorable** (8): yuhhh

**WeastofEden44** (8): Me every time I go on Grindr

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): ariana release this as the fucking single challenge its not hard this couldve been a phenom era

**twat\_brained** (7.4): it's like Ari took what was great about Side to Side (Nicki) and completely reduced it to a barebones structure. The wah guitar is way better than trumpets would ever sound here.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (7.3): annoying pre-chorus and bridge. good chorus and verses. i'm conflicted.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.1): Idk this didn't age well

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Another bop. I love the vibes this creates. It's the funkiest one night stand song yet.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Aged like milk for me. For some reason I don't find it even remotely exciting anymore, whoops.

**george\_kaito** (7): chile

**nick1372** (7): yuh

**Nickl00** (7): solid bop

**plastichaxan** (7): i don't listen to this too often cause i'm scared i'll stop liking it

**akanewasright** (6.7): This song lost a lot of replay value for me, but I will never skip it when it comes on. I just put it on a lot of playlists... which I now regret.

**runaway3212** (6.5): I never got what this song is trying to say

**cashewconstellation** (6.3): I don't care for it. Like, I've listened to the album at least 20 times, the other songs have grown on me, but this ain't it.

**bandnitos** (6): it seems empty

**leviswift13** (6): i've never gotten this song. it just doesn't do it for me.

**skargardin** (6): I don't remember this song being this mid but this doesn't really spark anything in me at all

**radiofan15** (5.9): What is this Side to Side ugly stepsister doing here?

**anothertown** (5): this is so forgettable, those dollar store horns

**CarlieScion** (5): this is just nasa but worse

**eeveefan01** (5): this song is a skip

**plantp0wer** (5): the instrumentals are annoying idk..

**RandomHypnotica** (5): don't want you in my playlist, just wanna have the good songs

**bulforster** (4.5): The horns feel like such a random inclusion to me, especially in the context of the album.

**vayyiqra** (4): omg ariana supports eugenics wtf i hate ariana now Yuh.

**wavingwolves** (4): the intro is the best thing about this

**kappyko** (2): not only is this eugenics it's also very boring

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this started very good and it turned into a bad little mix song...

Yep. This is me for this rate. I set aside my bias for Taylor (and Ariana to some extent) and rated these songs as if I am critiquing the albums. Good thing both of them are really good so they got good scores from me but I am going to root for Taylor to win as long as she has a song in the rate.

It's funny, because WWAFA is the most commercially successful album in this rate, easily outperforming Lover and thank u, next. If popheads is more familiar with those two, it's more of a demographic problem.

**bandnitos** (8): it's fun

**Nickl00** (8): the feature honestly doesn’t hurt or help the song

**dreamingoutloud92** (7.5): Plus 1 for DaBaby

**ImADudeDuh** (7): is his flow off????

**jayjaysortagay** (7): I'm super bored of the pointless remixes but this is one of the better ones.

**leviswift13** (7): she doesn't need backup

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Meh

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I don’t mind DaBaby's verse but it doesn’t seem like it fits the point of the song? Unless I’m just misunderstanding it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this doesn’t help the song in any form but stream Bop by DaBaby anyway

**meiscool132** (6.5): I usually like DaBaby's features, but the way he seems off beat in the beginning irks me, and overall added features in songs aren't pleasant to me

**rickikardashian** (6.5): baby has enough charisma to fit in this track, sadly he recorded his verse without a backing track and didn’t know what the tempo was://

**runaway3212** (6.5): Not needed, but I don't hate it like some remixes

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): She's better on her own. I do like that you can hear the backing vocals clearer.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): a concept: people understanding what the fuck a remix is.

**hadea0090** (6): do people not know what a remix is

**mayolizard** (6): dababy kinda ate

**nick1372** (6): DaBaby is talented but his verse is so terribly placed it completely ruins the momentum of the song

**pearllouise** (6): I misread this as "(feat. Bhad Bharbie)" for some odd goddamn reason idk I guess I need new glasses

**abysmalglimmer** (5): hmm there’s a pattern here of male artist remixes being worse... men should just not exist

**FluffyNobody** (5): I already wasn't a big fan of the original, this doesn't improve it

**hockey\_newfoundland** (5): DaBaby doesn't make this song any better or worse than the original so it gets the same rating

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): A song about not needing no man needs no man.

**letsallpoo** (5): i love dababy but like why is he off beat here lmfao

**ManofOranges** (5): Like so many other of these bonus tracks, I don't understand why the guest artist, in this case DaBaby, is here! I don't think his verse like does anything important and I find it just a bit ironic that in a song with the lyric "why men great til they gotta be great" they get a man to do a guest verse! Make it make sense!

**vayyiqra** (5): oh it's a song we've already rated but with an abusive cancelled guy on it why even bother trying to rate this fairly so it's getting a 5

**WeastofEden44** (5): So useless

**radiofan15** (4.9): DaBabidi has to be the most generic rapper that came out in 2019... why is he even popular?

**slazenger7** (4.5): Why do people keep making remixes that are markedly inferior to the originals?

**cleen\_claire** (4): Let's put a man on the remix of a female empowerment song good idea

**CreepyMannequin** (4): DaBaby is such a poor fit for this song

**CritneySpearz** (4): DaBaby ruins every song he’s on (except My Oh My) ugh..

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (4): This remix is quite unnecessary tbh. DaBaby’s verse contradicts the message of this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): why aren’t we rating the random Kpop boy band remix

**hunnybee12** (4): I know it's his style but dababy being so offbeat is sending me

**Kanne\_** (4): meh

**PointlessBibliophage** (4): sigh

**rhyneston3** (4): LMAO no

**waluigiest** (4): dababy im begging you to find the beat (oh he found it)

**wardrum5** (4): DaBaby be on beat challenge (very hard)

**wavingwolves** (4): dababy flow doesn't go with this song at all

**muchopartymuchomoney** (3.5): there is no point listening to this over the original (which can be said about all these remixes)

**Mysario** (3.3): this is terrible and incredibly unnecessary but I got a good amount of laughs at it, I'm never listening to this again unless it's ironically

**AnimationJava** (3): I usually prefer to listen to the original but I respect DaBaby's hustle a lot!

**Awkward\_King** (3): this just doesn't work for me

**Kromorei** (3): why does this exist

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): the verse is fine but it doesn't need to be on this song, it doesn't need to be where it is on the song, I'm confused, Peppermint's confused, we're all confused

**ggodisawomann** (2): truth hurts bye

**puberty1** (2): this one doesn't have "you coulda had a bad bitch non-committal" so it's trash by default

**rotating3Dtext** (2): no

**skargardin** (2): Girl, Dababy doesn't fit this song at ALL, his verse is so incredibly shoehorned in

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): wow this fan edited mashup is really rough, can i listen to the real remix now?

**1998tweety** (1): Giving this a 1 cause it ain't good, and out of solidarity for the AB6IX remix which is WAY better. Anyway stream "ROSE, SCENT, KISS" by gay icon Lee Dae HWI.

**fadedblue09** (1): Sorry sis but this is the worst remix on this list. It ticks all the boxes for a bad remix: mismatched collaboration, bad flow, blatantly shoehorned parts, etc.

**franch** (1): yikes. not only does he make the song worse, but how jarring to contrast Lizzo's empowering lyrics with lyrics about preferring a "hood bitch" to an educated woman. would give this my 0 if i could

**vhqv1997** (1): As if the original wasn't boring enough

“I’m a thick bitch, I need tempo” - every white girl/gay who *really* wants to be able to twerk. 

Lizzo really popped off with this one. One of the best features from Missy in a LONG time, and a STELLAR music video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3umK61YqHc

---

**Nickl00** (11): I know this might be a waste of my eleven but it’s such a great combo and sooo smooth

**pearllouise** (11): I never knew that I could lowkey vibe to a fucking flute

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): Praying this becomes a hit in 3 years

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): banger alert

**akanewasright** (10): I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE! This is the best song on the album, and it’s not even close. I don’t even like rap much, but it just so fun! This was the first time Missy Elliott really caught my attention, and she absolutely kills her verse.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i have anorexia but this goes off

**bandnitos** (10): IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!!!! TURN IT UP also this played at homecoming and i went whore mode

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic hook. Missy's verse is so funny, the "rrrrrrr" bars never fail to make me laugh they're so ridiculous

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Yo this is incredible. First time hearing it and it surely won't be the last.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): veeeeeeery close to snatching my 11! just such an interesting and fun collab!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song deserved more popularity cause this shit is a FUCKING BOP.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Accidental bear anthem! I feel seen for once!

**ggodisawomann** (10): also an 11 contender! god damn I need more Lizzo x Missy

**hadea0090** (10): makes me wanna shake my ass tbh

**hikkaru** (10): missy ate

**ignitethephoenix** (10): “slow songs are for skinny hoes, im a think bitch I need tempo” me a skinny hoe singing along with Lizzo

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is a motherfucking J A M!

**J\_Toe** (10): I love how Missy jumps out of the hood of a car in the video. It's very in line with her humour from her own music videos, like that time she swallowed a car, and that time her neck travelled across the screen.

**JMez2613** (10): if you don't give this song above an eight, then this song clearly was not written for you

**kappyko** (10): should be top 3. Best part of the song is Missy Elliott COMPLETELY failing to roll the R on "Currrve" she just kinda spits out the syllable

**lilacsweetener** (10): WOO

**ManofOranges** (10): This song could not have come soon enough on the album. It's also just a bop so that really helps as well. The only problem that have a with this song is the accesserary lyrics. Like when I hear lyrics like that I'm just like "...really?" like it feels lazy and stupid. I thought about taking off like a point or sumn because of it but I don't hate this song itself enough to do that.

**mayolizard** (10): ok smash classic methinks

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): Lizzo and Missy Elliot is like a utopian collab, and the song is just as fantastic as I'd except from these queens. Our Melissas slayed. Strong 11 contender.

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Which one of y’all said Lizzo wasn’t a rapper?

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): why do i love this song so much i'm literally a skinny hoe

**radiofan15** (10): This song makes me wish I was f*t

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way Missy rolls her tongue, the way she events the word Grrrrrrrd, the English language was not the same after this song

**rhyneston3** (10): Choosing between this and You Should See Me in a Crown for my 11 was so difficult... This still slaps harder than any other song released last year, and I almost had an aneurism when I heard it in the club

**rsmitty99** (10): I miss missy at the top of the charts

**skargardin** (10): they both ate this song tf up

**Stryxen** (10): I’ve been WAITING for this one to get the juice treatment. Stream Ten-po

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): damn this song is still just SO GOOD. the first half of Missy's verse is on point.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): man this shit goes so hard. whew

**waluigiest** (10): slaps slaps SLAPS I’m tired of skinny white gays going too hard to this song but wow if this wasn’t a moment

**wavingwolves** (10): missy elliott said furry rights and i support her she can say it

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): this song drunk is an otherworldly experience

**WeastofEden44** (9.6): So well-done. I'm not huge on rap, like I listen to some but it's not my go-to, but I will never skip this song

**materialqirl** (9.5): fuck it up to the tempo ayeee

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): This song came on once at the bar I used to do trivia at and it was an experience

**wardrum5** (9.5): the irony of every twink calling this their anthem for the first half of 2019

**1998tweety** (9): Okay this slaps, both of them ate this up (and then some hihi).

**Agusarg** (9): Such a banger, all the singles for the album were amazing

**anagalisgv** (9): iconic

**Anthony-Vince** (9): A bop, but that one line where Missy fails at rolling her Rs ALWAYS bugs me and I will never get over it

**jayjaysortagay** (9): I'm a thicc bitch and I drop it to tempo REGULARLY

**Kromorei** (9): any missy ft. is fire.

**mms82** (9): tiktok queen

**puberty1** (9): as a skinny hoe who loves slow songs this song is fantastic

**wasian-invasion** (9): "being thick needing tempo slow songs are for skinny hos" Anthony fantano (2019)

**Mysario** (8.6): this quarantine can suck it, I wanna go drop it low to this club bop

**cashewconstellation** (8.5): Oh, I'm vibing with this!

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): stream Tempo

**agentofscranton** (8): ask me a year ago and this would've been a 10, but i've just gotten a lil bit bored of this, which feels like something that shouldn't happen to a collab between lizzo and actual missy elliott

**AnimationJava** (8): This song's an earworm tbh

**anothertown** (8): missy rhyming everything with rolled r's is everything i could want

**cleen\_claire** (8): Accessorary

**cremeebrulee** (8): drag me for being skinny …… please lizzo

**leviswift13** (8): okay this some bad bitch shit up in here.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): this one is for you /u/gannade [+1]

**twat\_brained** (8): Lizzo was doing pretty good but Missy just runs circles around her with one verse. Give me more Missy! Hell, give me more Missy and Lizzo collabs

**vayyiqra** (8): thicc

deleted: **dreamingoutloud92** (7.5): Not my favorite song, but “I’m a thick bitch, I need tempo” is an incredible line.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Imagine if she got Meghan Trainor on this one....

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): I like whatever song she's singing in the first 10 seconds! I like the actual song we got a bit less.

**george\_kaito** (7): ive been WAITING for this one... turn it up!!

**meiscool132** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of Missy Elliott but this song is really fun with the both of them

**nick1372** (7): accessorary

**nooodisaster** (7): The beat drop is just oh my. But everything else is just oh no. Why can Lizzo not make one full good song?

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): I loved it initially but I've definitely cooled on it since

**runaway3212** (6.5): It's sounds a bit messy at times.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Honestly I find this song incredibly overrated, I know we all want to like it because Missy is a legend but this is kind of a missed opportunity. The chorus is catchy and the groove is slick but the song just feels so flat? The more laidback energy is a nice change of pace on the album but the end result is a song that doesn’t feel very dynamic, even Missy’s verse doesn’t switch things up that much. You can even see this in the music video, wherein absolutely nothing happens. It’s not *bad* but it’s just like, kinda there. HOWEVER I’ll now say “accessorary” if I’m not paying attention so her impact I guess. Also body shaming… exists, is all I’m gonna say.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Honestly Missy’s verse is kinda weak in this and this shouldve been a Lizzo solo

**fadedblue09** (5): Yeah sis, this song needs more tempo.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (4): Not quite my...tempo. looool (I have references and bad puns, bitch knows how to multitask)

**JanuaryFourteenth** (4): I’m not much for the 2014 Mustard sounding production at the beginning, also Missy’s rolling Rs is rrrrrrrrreally annoying

**vhqv1997** (4): Why does this song have a Bollywood influence?

**FluffyNobody** (0): I cannot express how much I hate this song and the 2 minutes and 55 seconds I spent listening to this and I will never get back

**franch** (0): "feat. Missy Elliott" post-2018 seems to be more of a warning label

**fadedblue09** (11): Taylor, sweetie, I’m so sorry for slandering your album, here’s your compensatory 11! Anyway, here are my reasons why this is my top track on Lover: It sounds like a reputation cut minus the questionable stylistic choices, and lyric-wise it probably features one of her most mature and creative storytelling, something I haven’t seen since Speak Now. While most of the album spends time rehashing the glory of her past work (and failing to do so), this one moves her forward. Now if only there were more tracks like this….

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): this is it. this is the taylor song we need.

**abysmalglimmer** (10): the political messages and beautiful production... a dream

**agentofscranton** (10): this is the kind of music i thought a joel little x taylor collab would produce. more of this please.

**alwayswords** (10): lana wants what taylor has i think

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Great song that would've made for an amazing music video

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I am so glad Taylor finally tackled politics and it came with the signature Taylor Swift Cinematic Universe (TSCU) sound that we all loved. Using a high school setting as the backdrop for this song is perfect considering how political the youth is.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): , my favorite song off this album, I just love the sound and the lyrics are top notch <3

**franch** (10): ok ok "LDR vibes" sure fine but it slaps

**hikkaru** (10): the layers to this song yup yup

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Woke ass QUEEN!

**jackisboredtoday** (10): This bangs so hard and I love it so much, even if Taylor is the artist who can least sell “bad bad girl” in the whole pop scene

**Jimmy345960** (10): This was almost my eleven. I love that she is starting to go political and it has inspired me to speak up in my own life. I hope she continues in this direction.

**ladililn** (10): The internet has failed me, vol. 3290: nobody has made a Buffy/Angel fanvid set to this song yet.

**leviswift13** (10): sooooooo fucking smart. the lyrics are tumblr pop perfection yet still so taylor. only she can make political disillusionment sound so romantic.

**ManofOranges** (10): Finally another song that I actually really like from this album. It sounds nice, I think the little story line going on is interesting enough. Also, is anyone reminded of JoJo's "Leave (Get Out)" with the bridge of the song. When she's yells "fight" or "win" I'm only reminded of JoJo yelling "leave!" and "now!"

**materialqirl** (10): the cheer shouts :weary:

**mayolizard** (10): this is a 10 but im skipping so i can get this done faster jdfdfjhdf pls

**meiscool132** (10): high school au + good political views = 10

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): The best song on the album period. The imagery is so vivid and paints a full picture. And that bridge is to die for.

**puberty1** (10): "voted most likely to run away with you" is top 10 best taylor lyrics and no one can tell me otherwise. also so it goes is a good song

**radiofan15** (10): Is this Lorde's Tennis Court?

**SFbby** (10): The verses are smooth, the production is slick and dark, and the title is perfect for Miss Swift

**skargardin** (10): Where was this type of songwriting energy on like 1/3rd of this album

**slazenger7** (10): Underrated outside the Swiftiverse.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): When the album came out this year I thought this would be my 11 when we eventually rated it. It's grown off me a bit but it's still a bop.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): honestly one of Taylor's best songs and i've been listening to her since Our Song

**TiltControls** (10): Took a while to grow on me, but I'm fully on board.

**twat\_brained** (10): SHE IS THE MISS AMERICANA, TAKING THE CROWN FROM MADONNA, NOT LIZZO OR ARIANA, TAYLOR IS MISS AMERICANA! jokes aside, this song is an enlightening experience at 3 am collecting my sorrows

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): The atmosphere of this song is amazing. Purely sonically, this is the best song on the album, but the lyrics are somewhat inconsistent in quality

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Personally I prefer Miss Americana and the Goblet of Fire but this one is still very good

**avenueroy** (9.2): ANYONE WANNA EXPLAIN WHY THIS WASN'T A SINGLE? HELLO?

**1998tweety** (9): This didn't immediately click for me but know that it has I have to stan. The lyrics are so damn clever, I love all the meanings to them. Taylor going to from have no stance on politics to then writing this song is so wild, this really is the perfect song she could've written on the matter huh.

**bandnitos** (9): this song doesn't have any specific bad memories attached to it but it feels like it does so i can't give it a 10

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): Stronger than Only The Young with its message but still does she have to make us look like 'whiny sore losers' with some of these lyrics?

**rhyneston3** (9): Am I a Swiftie now?

**vhqv1997** (9): Thank God we finally stopped debating whether this song was about politics or a love story, because I am ready to crank out my thesis statement about how Miss Americana is actually just her fursona and this entire thing is a kinky roleplay soundtrack for her and Joe's nocturnal funtimes.

**Stryxen** (8.9): boys will be boys <3 dula peep teas x

**cashewconstellation** (8.8): Wow, this is much more of a bop than I remember.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i like the way taylor writes in songs like this it just clicks with me

**FluffyNobody** (8.5): I liked this one much more when it just came out, but t doesn't have a lot of replay value. Still, political Taylor at her best

**mms82** (8.5): great song but honestly feels way longer than it is which stops it from being a fave

deleted: **AnimationJava** (8): Very catchy and fun! One of the highlights of the album.

**axestogrind** (8): I wish the political metaphor was less... clumsy (what does 'you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes' mean in the context of the election? Americans deserve Trump because they participate in the two party system? is Miss Swift an anarchist?) but a bop is a bop

**cleen\_claire** (8): Chorus goes OFF, this one grew on me too

**eeveefan01** (8): A good balad

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This song has a very nice flow to it, but that's really not enough for it to stand out in an album with such a convoluted tracklist.

**hadea0090** (8): The title initially made me cringe but the song is nice.

**Kromorei** (8): a bop honestly. doesn't belong on this album.

**letsallpoo** (8): https://twitter.com/MeleeTSwiftClip outsold

**lilacsweetener** (8): Took a while to understand the metaphor completely but the song is very affecting. She just wants to be okay, sometimes that isn’t possible immediately. So you hold onto what/who you can and try to let that be your comfort. Arguably should’ve been the single paired with the doco because this track really reflects the global feeling of “Where are we going and what will we do?”

**NotWith10000Men** (8): darling I'm scared too

**patcheso8** (8): if the message behind this song wasn't explained to me I would have had no idea it was political. I think the metaphor is confusing tbh. Is it about her? is it about Hillary Clinton? bop tho

**pearllouise** (8): If you're reading this, make sure to go to vote.gov to register for the US presidential election and vote blue on November 3rd. That's all. Have a good day.

**ReallyCreative** (8): I want to love this song but I'm just TOO tired of the high school metaphors Taylor is obsessed with. I also just don't think she's specific or hard-hitting enough for a supposedly "political track." That said, the bridge with the cheerleader call-and-response? Genius. Art. A moment.

**vayyiqra** (8): At first I thought the high school-themed lyrics were kind of cringe until I looked into them further and realized how they're heavily ironic, which goes with the dark-sounding melody, and I fuck heavily with that. I get almost an Electra Heart vibe from this.

**WeastofEden44** (8): This aged a bit but it's still a very good song

**Mysario** (7.9): there's some things about this song I like and others I don't

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): This is how you write a political song, Taylor. Only The Young should’ve taken notes

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): p good

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I’ve heard people describe this song as confusing which I think it’s accurate. I like it enough but don’t like it that much at the same time.

**runaway3212** (7.5): I never really liked the bridge but the rest of the song is very good.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): by Fall Out Boy

**untutorable** (7.5): i vibe with it tbh

**akanewasright** (7): It’s probably not a coincidence that the song considered to be the best of the Joel Little cuts is the one that sounds like an Antonoff track.

**CarlieScion** (7): sonically great, very confusing lyrically - trying to both tell a love story/political story/references to Taylor’s summer 16 makes the song just. Very jumbled. However I can no loger read the phrase ‘play stupid games win stupid prizes’ without hearing Taylor

**george\_kaito** (7): it feels very pretentious for some reason, but i love the production

**jayjaysortagay** (7): the lyrics are cringe but taylor is selling it, the production is very 2015 Halsey but I mean that in a good way

**Nickl00** (7): its kind of lame for it being Taylor’s big political statement but still not bad

**wasian-invasion** (7): is this supposed to be political? I cant really tell

**CreepyMannequin** (6): I really like the verses but the chorus is kinda...eh

**wavingwolves** (6): i still don't really know how i feel about this song but i always hated the "GO! FIGHT! WIN!" chant

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): boring

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5.5): Whatever you guys are hearing in that song, I'm not hearing it. Maybe the lyrics hit differently for americans, but as an european, it's too vague and childlish. The melody is not good either.

**kappyko** (5): the way i heard that chorus synth and instantly knew this was joel little lol

**plantp0wer** (5): the screaming “okay!”, “go!” “fight” and “win” pls no

**waluigiest** (5): I have a suspicion that this song thinks it’s something much more than it is

**Brendon-Urine** (4): super bland honestly, nothing stuck out for me. the call and reponse with the yelling at the end is pretty annoying

**nick1372** (4): She tried to pull a Lana but this song is FAR too vague to have any meaningful political message. Just comes across as "I have no real problems but politics makes me uncomfortable"

**strangergravityfalls** (4): nothing good ever came out of anyone older than 25 mentioning prom

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (2.5): i want to know who fucked taylor up in high school that she still has to talk about it in her music. no one called you a bad bad girl in the hallway taylor

**anothertown** (2): LOL is this song about how she just barely became politically aware in 2018? LMao

**bespectacIed** (2): One of the worst songs in Lover. Taylor doing a poor copy of Lana's sound, if anything it went from worse to worser

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): what a shame I only have one zero

**ComeOnPupperfish** (0): This is a self-insert fanfiction being sold as high literature in the most boring way possible. Even the call and response bridge, something I thought could save this song from being a 0, sounds like her trying to shape her narrative once more.

I am really sad because I associate this song now with Billie’s tarantulas and I **really** hate spiders. 

I’m also gonna say, this is another example of actually loud production. This is a bit annoying for me to listen to, but I guess y’all kinda love it? 

I love seeing a couple of Lizzo haters who gave this and other Billie tracks with heavy bass high scores despite them not enjoying the sounds Lizzo makes with her voice/production, and that’s the tea. 

---

**rhyneston3** (11): This was the first Billie song I ever got into and it still sounds fresher than ever. I love how evil it sounds, I wish more artists did stuff like this

**agentofscranton** (10): gothsdancingunderabridge.gif

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Love the production!

**cremeebrulee** (10): banger. i fucking love this song. (it also seems like the type of song that people back in the day would make fandom edits to lol)

**franch** (10): this song on the EP gave me life that i was going to have a new pop fave. then the album happened. oops. :|

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a banger

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh this was a damn hit! Love billie

**JMez2613** (10): the production is exquisite

**kappyko** (10): yes

**lapascalia** (10): I really prefer upbeat Billie over sad Billie and I’m not sorry ‘bout it.

**lilacsweetener** (10): Her most Lorde moment. I need a Lorde collab at some point. This makes me shake, I love girl power anthems like this that aren’t spelling out they’re girl power anthems. It’s just like “I’m here, I exist, fuck you”.

**mayolizard** (10): this is amazing

**meiscool132** (10): I absolutely love powerful and superior Billie

**mms82** (10): the song that got me hooked on billie. such a power song

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): CROWN

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is honestly very intense and kinda scary I fucking love it.

**Nickl00** (10): this is probably the coolest Billie has sounded since COPYCAT

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this fucking slaps. I want more music like this from her

**pearllouise** (10): she should really retitle the song "You Should See Me In A Corona" just to make it more current

**radiofan15** (10): DAE misses dubstep? or is it just me?

**runaway3212** (10): This is the song that really made me fall in love with Billie

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): the production on this album makes it for me and this song is no exception, queen of wearing crowns

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): if you think about it this goes dumb hard

**WeastofEden44** (9.5): I low-key pussy pop to this

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.3): A worse version of Lorde’s Flicker, but Flicker is possibly my favorite song of all time so this is still good

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): contrast really elevates this

**Mazike** (9.1): a bop

**bandnitos** (9): bad bitch time

**hawksband** (9): used to listen to this bop while playing fortnite

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): This has some energy and it doesn’t feel like a character to me, I think the leg up it has on “Bad Guy” is that “Bad Guy” feels super childish, but this feels so mature and tough and intimidating. Bad Guy’s got this nursery rhyme kinda feel, this feels like a manifesto

**nooodisaster** (9): A BOP!!!!!!!!!!1 Love the "Ocean Eyes" callback, love the drop, love the bad bitch energy.

**puberty1** (9): moriarty walked so this song could run

**skargardin** (9): banger

**vayyiqra** (9): A dark monarchist trap banger! The breakdown in the middle is weird and doesn't add much, but the chorus is so strong.

**waluigiest** (9): this goes so so hard AND I lose my mind every time I remember the murakami music video

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): It’s a bit edgy but I’ll give her a pass for it because she’s so young and because she’s… actually pulling it off? She sounds cooler than me.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): elementary > bbc sherlock but i still support moriarty in both shows

**twat\_brained** (8.4): I still remember my trainer being visibly disgusted when I showed her a tarantula crawling out of Billie's mouth

**cleen\_claire** (8): this makes me feel like the baddest bitch ever

**Evanbrooks324** (8): a very interesting sound from this song, wasn't a fan of it at first but it's grown on me

**jayjaysortagay** (8): strong entry but not a stand out in any particular area compared to the album as a whole

**Kromorei** (8): billie really pog for this one

**leviswift13** (8): i do like this bc i feel like an evil queen who just destroyed a village!

**ReallyCreative** (8): this do make me feel like a bad bitch

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): when i was at the orthodontist one time all the tvs had ellen on and it was the episode where billie performed this song and the fear on all the 50+ white women’s faces watching and listening to this was indescribable

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.9): Love how soft and heavy she can go in a single song (not vocally, but sonically if that makes sense)

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7.8): amazing chorus, and i love the growl like effects throughout

**Mysario** (7.7): I think this might be my favourite production-wise for all the subtleties in it but like... it's aight

**anothertown** (7.5): I don’t go up for the whole game of thrones thing this is doing but something was achieved here probably

**bulforster** (7.5): I feel like I would've enjoyed this a lot when I was a tryhard-edgy teen which makes me cringe a bit to think about and enjoy the song a bit less.

**materialqirl** (7.5): badass but tiktok..gorl

**rsmitty99** (7.5): Man this shit's weird. It's growing on me. Liking the production so far

**Stryxen** (7.5): every time I get to the end of this song I just go “:o oh”. so intense for absolutely no reason but go off I guess ms eilish

**untutorable** (7.5): i really like the chorus on this one but the verses are a bit forgettable in comparison

**frogaranaman** (7): so she's freaky freaky

**george\_kaito** (7): what halsey reject is this

**ManofOranges** (7): It's a good enough song. Having xanny before it makes it appear better in my eyes, but any song would appear better to me if it's put after xanny. It's slightly too brooding and boring for me to fully invest my interest though.

**Tolk1en** (7): a bit too repetitive unfortunately, but overall interesting

**akanewasright** (6): This could have been cut easily, but I don’t hate the song.

**anagalisgv** (6): love the vocal distortion

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): The beat goes hard and her voice goes well with this song.

**CarlieScion** (6): I love angry whispering

**ggodisawomann** (6): this is okay, first Billie song I ever heard

**hadea0090** (6): probably my least fav from the album but when it comes on shuffle, I can't skip it

**vhqv1997** (6): Remember when she teased people with the video for this song by putting spiders on her face like that was some badass shit and not something everyone can do with 8 animal trainers on standby and a good ol mental shutdown due to severe repressed trauma?

**J\_Toe** (5): I swear the sound mixing of this version is better than the original (where the vocals were competing with the instrumentals). Also, the rumination on crowns and aristocracy is reminiscent of Pure Heroine Lorde.

**nick1372** (5): this one didnt connect for me and im not sure why

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Unnecessarily creepy IMO. And the vocal production is too demonic and grating.

**AnimationJava** (4): I liked it a lot when it came out but it aged poorly for me.

**bespectacIed** (4): Lorde did the sinister villain vibe better

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4): I don't like this! This is Billie at her most pretentious, in my opinion.

**TiltControls** (2.5): the breakdown kills this for me

**1998tweety** (1): An awful awful loud mess. The chorus is honestly offensive. The verses are good tho so I won't give this a 1. The bridge is also incredibly bad though so....maybe it does deserve the 1.

**Mysario** (7.6): some parts of this are wicked good, other parts are just there

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): ehhhhh i had higher hopes for this trio. its ok. how i look on you is the better ari song on the charlies angles soundtrack

**cashewconstellation** (7.4): I like it

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Love this one. It should have taken off.

**pearllouise** (7): Gonna tell my kids this was Destiny's Child

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ᴺᵒʳᵐᵃⁿᶦ- Nicki Minaj, 2019

**Tolk1en** (7): a bop, but I don't understand Nicki's part, it doesn't fit imo

**WeastofEden44** (7): Ilike this song, don't come for me

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): this is better than DCMA but it's hardly great and really just feels like a weird cousin of Side to Side

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): i wish we but How I Look On You in this bonus rate instead of this since that song is actually, like, memorable

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6.2): Not bad, it just sounds so Side to side :/

**1998tweety** (6): Disappointing.

**bandnitos** (6): this combo had so much potential

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): This kinda slaps, or am I going insane? (edit: I made that comment before the Nicki verse.)

**jayjaysortagay** (6): catchy but a bit underwhelming. Nicki is on full autopilot.

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): Still better than the movie

**meiscool132** (6): I'm sad because these three girls had waaay more potential to create a massive hit but this is what we got :/

**bbfan132** (5.5): bland but nicki was good here

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): Eh. Nicki went off as usual but this is uninteresting, especially for a Max Martin production.

**nick1372** (5): Nicki's verse is fine but Normani and Ariana don't mix well. The track is just too clunky

**nooodisaster** (5): this really coulda

**Tedyonce** (5): eh...blah, which is really sad considering that lineup

**wasian-invasion** (4.5): wow I heard this when it came out then never again

**alwayswords** (4): i hate the production on charlie angel’s soundtrack im sorry

**fadedblue09** (4): And with that, I completely lost my interest in listening to this soundtrack. At least it's not as annoying as Side to Side.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I was like “Normani and Ariana and Nicki Minaj did a song together? Why have I never heard of this before?” and then I pressed play.

**hockey\_newfoundland** (4): Better than Don't Call me an Angel. That's not saying much though

**Nickl00** (4): this is even worse of a missed opportunity than DCMA. Like how is this not a banger

**rhyneston3** (4): The potential ugh it could have been so much better!

**runaway3212** (4): The hate Don't Call Me Angel got should've been aimed at this song.

**vayyiqra** (4): go away onika and these lyrics are so cringe

**wavingwolves** (4): this sounds like it was released in 2015

**cleen\_claire** (3): no no no

**Johnnytoby** (3): a worse side to side, dont know why norma is there

**skargardin** (3): with a lineup like this you have ALL the ingredients to succeed and then the result is.. this?

**jmedina16** (2): whew this was a miss

**ImADudeDuh** (1): the flop power of this song

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): why do all of these bonus Ariana tracks have to suck so much

**radiofan15** (1): Remember when people were hyping this soundtrack thinking it would be the next Black Panther/Great Gatsby? Also... remember when people AND the music industry were hyping Normani thinking she would be the next Beyoncé but she ended up as the Lance Bass of the band?

**vhqv1997** (1): Honestly this soundtrack told us all we needed to know about this movie. Some of the most talented people in the business got together to power through a depthless project that was advertised as empowering. Hate to say it but empowerment doesn't come from reading adwords and catchphrases, it comes from an emotional resonance, and the message of the entire movie, as well as the soundtrack, falls squarely on the latter.

This was the Lizzo song that established her as the new pop icon of our time for me. Strong, **intense** vocals, and a really strong hook. She isn’t just pure pop, this is a perfect representation of Lizzo and her music. 

I also love the music video for this song, it should be required viewing for any fan of this song. 

---

**Agusarg** (10): Some find her voice grating on this track but I love it. She sounds amazing

**Awkward\_King** (10): the way in which i was stunned when this came out

**bandnitos** (10): IMMMMMC. RYIINGG. CY Z I LOVE EYOUUUUUUD{

**CarlieScion** (10): A GREAT INTRO

**cleen\_claire** (10): I was FLOORED the first time I heard this and my reaction is still the same

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'M CRYYYINNN CUZ I LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Lizzo's vocals are everything here. And she wasn't vocally trained previously????? Wow.

**george\_kaito** (10): an iconic intro, she served vocals

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is so powerful, it hurts me just to listen to it. I have to dislocate my jaw just to lip synch it. I can’t even imagine how Lizzo’s body can channel this amount of power without it obliterating her body. That’s a death wail

**hadea0090** (10): CUZ I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU

**hikkaru** (10): amazing opener period

**jayjaysortagay** (10): nevah been in luv befooooooo

**Johnnytoby** (10): yuupyup that's an intro

**JunkyGS** (10): vOOOOOOOOOcals

**ladililn** (10): This knocks me tf out tbh

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this song is a fucking release

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): We love a VOCALIST.

**pearllouise** (10): I never knew a brass orchestra could give me goosebumps jeez

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): ya ya > yuh yuh

**radiofan15** (10): Still salty about that time in which I praised this song and r/Popheads for finally hyping up someone with actual talent instead of talentless hacks like Marina and Jack Antonoff and I still got downvoted for it

**rhyneston3** (10): What an opener!!!!! Wow blow me away Lizzo

**rsmitty99** (10): Fuck yeah. What a fucking intro to an album. Bombastic, loud, in your face. I fucking love this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): IIIIIIIIII’M CRYIN

**wavingwolves** (10): tbh i think i'm love impaired

**WeastofEden44** (10): PERIODT I LOVE YOU TOO LIZZO

**Stryxen** (9.9): such a perfect intro AND title track

**1998tweety** (9.5): A BOP, a GOOD opener to a GOOD album.

**puberty1** (9.5): in a rate with great openings (and I Forgot That You Existed), this may be my favorite one. Lizzo just pours her feelings here and it's fantastic

**akanewasright** (9): The song is just a delight. I was unreasonably happy the month where that random rom-com was being blitzkrieg advertised because it meant I heard this song in the wild a whole lot.

**bespectacIed** (9): Ugh love the raw emotion that drips into this song. Those belts at the end ... the thundering pianos ... serve.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Her vocals are just incredible here.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): The first ten seconds prepare you for everything you need to know. The build-up for the chorus got to me everytime.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I don’t really like the verses as much but the chorus is amazing and I love how grand it is

**Kanne\_** (9): me on more than one level, also the pace? bye

**meiscool132** (9): YES instrumentals!! YES belting!!

**NotWith10000Men** (9): gahDAMN those notes

**runaway3212** (9): Insanely good

**skargardin** (9): she better SIING

**untutorable** (9): i'm crying cuz i love this song tbh

**waluigiest** (9): I wasn’t super into this when it came out as a single, but I LOVE it in the context of the album. Her vocals are insane and the “Once upon time I was a hoe / I don’t even wanna hoe no more” is the apex of songwriting

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): what an album opener

**Mysario** (8.9): great intro to the album and gives you what you'll expect from the rest of it. the big band sound to this is fantastic

**slazenger7** (8.7): Girl can sing.

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): A powerful intro to the album, she just knows how to give it her all

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): amazing opener, when those horns come in??? immaculate

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): Talk about starting an album! Damn, this is really the best of Lizzo in one song.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): A great start to the album, I really like her voice on this one

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): great opener, amazing vocals. but if this song comes on in shuffle it’s over for your ears

**anothertown** (8): the horns could be mixed so much better, i feel like? they are just kind of all muddled back there in the mix

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): What a way to open up your album! This song is pure Lizzo on her A Game

**nick1372** (8): a perfect showcase of Lizzo's flow + her vocals

**nooodisaster** (8): This is how you start an album. After the first 10 seconds tho, it settles down from the 11 it was for a moment.

**fadedblue09** (7.6): It's cute, but it also sounds like a showtune??

**dreamingoutloud92** (7.5): WOW lot’s of raw energy to open the album.

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7.5): I like happy pain

**mms82** (7.5): not my speed but her voice is fantastic

**twat\_brained** (7.4): my vocal cords hurt just from thinking about this song

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7): Miss Lizzo is about to make my headphones explode, other than that is a powerful opener

**ManofOranges** (7): I like this song but I don't love it. I do like the sense of fanfare that it has and as an opener I think it's fine, but it also very quickly clues me into the fact that there a lot of lyrics in album that border on just bad. And that's coming from someone who rarely ever cares about or listens to lyrics, but when they're bad I can't help but fixate on them. Like "once upon a time I was a ho I don't even wanna ho no more" I just do not like it I'm sorry.

**Nickl00** (7): it’s just SO loud

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7): the instrumentals really elevate the chorus, and Lizzo's voice is strong enough to not be drowned out

**wasian-invasion** (7): loved the grammy performance but idk on repeat listens it's a little much

**AnimationJava** (6.5): A decent amount of vocals for an opening track on the album!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): those first few notes that bring around the hook are such a good start for the album, but the verses let it down. There are better songs on the album that let her vocals wail away like this

**FluffyNobody** (6): I like the gospel influence, but the song doesn't blow me away

**Jimmy345960** (6): could never get into this track which stinks cause I love this album.

**leviswift13** (6): solid opener, i think she is pushing a lil vocally but still attention-grabbing

**lilacsweetener** (6): This song is exhausting in a good way.

**vhqv1997** (6): The guitar is the best part of the song

**Anthony-Vince** (5): Too loud and I don't like that it's the album opener

**bulforster** (5): Even though it's impressive, her voice straining like this doesn't sound good and backed by that instrumental after the chorus it's just all a bit much.

**ggodisawomann** (5): good showage of her vocals but could be betttaaaa

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Sorry, but I can not get over the “AAAAHHHH’M CRYIN” it just does not sound good to me.

**gannade** (4): a gorgeous instrumental and then lizzo takes a dump all over it

**cyborglilith** (3): bruh

**franch** (3): i want to like this song and it's bombastic in the right way but i find her scream-singing sort of annoying

**strangergravityfalls** (3): meghan trainor wouldn't put out something this raw, meghan trainor would dress this up much better

**vayyiqra** (3): yeah The Blues Brothers was a good movie but why are we rating deep cuts from its soundtrack

**kappyko** (2): egh this wouldve been better as a full soul song those verses are AWFUL.

We all knew this was going to be an Ariana listening party leading into day 3, and in retrospect, this probably could’ve gone out a little bit earlier. It’s a fun bop, but I have a few songs I’d definitely put above this. HOWEVER. This outro is phenomenal, and I STAN long reprises/outros for songs. 

Disclaimer: I also didn’t realize it was Ari-chan, I thought it was Ari, jump! Stan Super Mario Odyssey.

---

**hawksband** (11): you know songs like these they are stories that people can identify with you know what i mean anybody children were singing this song at graduations at weddings at funerals

**JanuaryFourteenth** (11): I have no idea why this wasn’t a single like it’s so catchy, it’s really relatable, it’s fun, it’s got good atmosphere, it’s tense without being dark, it’s pop perfection, it’s probably my second favorite Ariana song ever

**Johnnytoby** (11): cult classic, those strings, ari-chan!

**agentofscranton** (10): we love a japanese icon. that outro is godly.

**alwayswords** (10): ari-chan!

**Anthony-Vince** (10): This had to grow on me but when it did it was amazing!

**cleen\_claire** (10): that whole outro??? religious experience

**eeveefan01** (10): another certified BOP

**fadedblue09** (10): BANGER ALERT! When I first heard this track, this was an immediate standout. Also that outro is majestic.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I love this, ari-chans and all. I SCREAM in my car to this song. SCREAM.

**hikkaru** (10): the outro... chefs kiss

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Another one of my favourites. The vocals, the melody and the production is all :chefskiss:

**jayjaysortagay** (10): this is maybe my favourite on the album. That guitar line???? 😍😍😍😍 The lyrics are just the right amount cheeky, this song is what BUWYG, IB wants to be.

**Jimmy345960** (10): This one was on repeat last year. The atmosphere.

**Kanne\_** (10): gave the score 2 seconds in, don't regret it

**lapascalia** (10): For some reason I didn’t like this song when I first heard it… what was I thinking? The outro is amazing.

**leviswift13** (10): career highlight. dark pop that we need rn. it's so sensual and chaotic and intense and dramatic and huge in the best way. her vocals are oooOOOOoooooOo000OOOO so good

**mayolizard** (10): ari chan! This deserved a video

**meiscool132** (10): this song gets me so hyped every time!! and the strings are so unexpected but elevate it so well! also the vocals! and the beat!

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): title does not check out. this is, by far, the best song on the album

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): God those strings are fantastic.

**Nickl00** (10): I absolutely love the guitar in this and the strings to trap transition is always hype

**pearllouise** (10): Slay me bitch. Slay me. This made my wig fly to Virginia.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): a r i - c h a n

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I’m not always a fan of long outros but this one really works for me

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): everything about this song is amazing

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): perfection. should have been a single.

**dreamingoutloud92** (9.5): Best produced track on the album for sure. And that outro was awesome!

**Kromorei** (9.5): just about as close as you can get to a perfect ari song

**Mazike** (9.5): best song in this album change my mind

**1998tweety** (9): Tbh I love this, the chorus is GREAT. One thing I would change is that long-ass outro.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): This song is too damn catchy. Wish this had been the third single instead of BUWYGF

**bespectacIed** (9): The electric guitars are a slay

**Brendon-Urine** (9): such a smooth ass song

**cashewconstellation** (9): A bop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): A R I - C H A N

**nick1372** (9): you will never convince me that the chants aren't saying "ari-chan" and I fucking hate it. still a bop tho.

**ReallyCreative** (9): A favorite from the album, it's just a step up from the other tracks.

**runaway3212** (9): I really love this song, it's the song that has aged the least for me.

**skargardin** (9): BOP

**wasian-invasion** (9): ari chan uwu

**WeastofEden44** (9): Me every time I go on Grindr but no because I'm horny but because I'm just lonely and feel fat again

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): anthem of my life

**akanewasright** (8.5): The biggest grower for me. Honest to God, I found this song repulsive at first. Now I find myself screaming “ARI-CHAN” in an obnoxious demon voice at random points in my life.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): you know what not making this a single was,,.,., a bad idea

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "I gotta baaaaaaaadddd idea (PARTY TIME!)". slut drops (Alternate comment: Ariana releasing that collab with Justin Bieber)

**rsmitty99** (8.5): I've always liked the song and skipped the end. Haha!

**Mysario** (8.4): but you didn't have to CUT ME OFF, make out like it never HAPpened and that we were nothing, and I don't even NEED YOUR LOVE, but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough 👏

**twat\_brained** (8.4): a 10 without the slowed audio. Not to mention how much of a missed opportunity it was to have this blend into God is a Woman

**anagalisgv** (8): dangerous woman vibes

**bandnitos** (8): the outro shouldve had a verse with that instrumental

**ceebs\_** (8): love the outro, wish it was longer!

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Mildly catchy? I really don't like the outro.

**hadea0090** (8): A vocalist!

**lilacsweetener** (8): Inventive, surprising production that keeps you guessing. Let down by boring subject matter.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): for some reason I don't listen to this one as much as the rest of the album. The outro gives it an extra point

**RandomHypnotica** (8): why does the outro exist

**rotating3Dtext** (8): ...ari-chan...why...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ok im not gonna lie the weeb in me thinks the little ari-chans are really cute

**waluigiest** (8): this would be the best song on the album if it weren’t for the AWFUL “Ari-chan” chants seriously wtf

**radiofan15** (7.8): ARI-CHAN... that's it, that's the comment

**FluffyNobody** (7.5): for a moment I confused it with in my head (the best diss track ever) and gave it a much higher score, sorry babe, this song wasn't exactly a bad idea, but it's not great either. However, it gets one point more for the outro

**Evanbrooks324** (7): , it's good but the ari chan lines make it worse

**rhyneston3** (7): I love her voice, song is a little boring though

**Stryxen** (7): I can vibe to this +2 for the outro

**vayyiqra** (7): (Ari-chan, uh-huh!) A weird, horny weeb bop. (Yuh-yuh.)

**slazenger7** (6.8): Great song with a useless outro. Probably a 7.5-8.0 if it ended at 3:30 instead of continuing for no reason.

**CarlieScion** (6): cute but the outro is long and annoying

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): That ending tho.

**george\_kaito** (6): ari-chan sends me

**wardrum5** (6): it's good until it goes on for an extra 1:20

deleted: **ManofOranges** (5): Now, since I thought fake smile was long and that was only 3 and a half minutes, you can imagine how I felt about this one's length. This one definitely feels a lot more boring than the other tracks before it. I think it really does get repetitive, and while I maintain that repetitive doesn't necessarily mean bad, there's nothing here to make the repetition mostly tolerable. Instead, it ends up just being average.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): Oh honey this song was a bad idea… but points for that instrumental outro moment, that was really nice.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): ok this was a cute 6 but then the ari-chan and the weird outro happened???

**kappyko** (4): [essay on anti-asian racism, activism as performance, how pop artists capitalize on controversy and how talking about it in any respect is what they want because they are literally too big to fail, and anti-blackness in asian-american circles]

**wavingwolves** (3): a big fat no to the "ari-chan" thing. i do like the outro, tho

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): titles that describe the song for $1000

**selegend** (2): some points for the string section, “ari chan”

**vhqv1997** (2): Ariana needs to stop with all these annoying chanting sound bites that play in the background

**bulforster** (0): When I listen to this I feel like it's deadening my brain which I think is kind of intentional but I don't enjoy it at all.

There was about 9 people calling out "loud" comments on this. I was only talking about this one specific song. I'm not trying to take away from the racism, but when you say you're trying to call out racist bias against black women and then call me ignorant, yes I will take it that you are trying to call me out.

This song went back and forth so much with thank u, next for the last spot in the top 10. It wasn’t locked in here until our last ballot, and it dropped two spots. There is less than a 2 point difference between #10/11/12 and if I’m gonna be honest, this deserved top 10 over the next two songs!

Holy shit this is one of my all time favorite Ariana songs. The build, the vocals, the outro? Legend shit.  

---

**lapascalia** (11): My favourite song from this album always changes, but I think this one has to be the best for me. It makes Ariana shine.

**nahaalne** (11): the first chorus with the super minimalist instrumental is everything and more

**Agusarg** (10): Her voice truly shines here, it's so good

**alwayswords** (10): pad thai lyric is ethnic

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This is my second 11. Holy SHIT those high notes.

**frogaranaman** (10): the Ariana song that deserved way more than it got. one of the most powerful and impressive songs she has ever released and doesn't get enough love in general

**hadea0090** (10): this song is my most played from the album. I love the lyrics. the "imaaaaagine" part used to annoy me at first but it has grown to be my favorite part of the song. especially at the end.

**hikkaru** (10): i love this flavour of r&b for ariana, with the bridge piano & whistles it lowkey serves yours truly i love it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is cute and also heartbreaking at the same time

**Johnnytoby** (10): Can you ~imagine~💙💙💙

**JunkyGS** (10): Incredibly close to getting my 11, but yeah this song is so fucking magical but also bittersweet when you reminisce about an ex that you loved.... not that I have done that several times while listening to this song x_X

**mudkip1** (10): come on, trees! come on, shrubs! come on, mariah!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): The superior Imagine.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): john lennon who

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i really wish more songs were in this direction on the album, i love "rnb"ana, i want more of her

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The best opening track out of all 4 albums and if you don’t agree you’re just wrong

**strangergravityfalls** (10): the song gal gadot and friends should have been covering

**Stryxen** (10): anthem. nothing more nothing less

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): it took a few months for this song to click for me and when it did DAMN

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is all you're getting from me

**Tolk1en** (10): pop perfection, what a voice. I still remember the goosebumps when I first heard her live performance. An emotional song with especially great lyrics

**untutorable** (10): ugh the last minute of this song is so fucking GOOD

**vhqv1997** (10): This song reminds me of her best album, Yours Truly. Need more songs like this and Honeymoon Avenue from her.

**wardrum5** (10): Gal Gadot should have covered this instead

**franch** (9.8): perfect start to the post-Sweetener era and it has lyrics about pad thai

**mayolizard** (9.7): really really cute

**1998tweety** (9.5): Okay I hate Ari and this album is so overrated but this is a good opener, so I'll give her that.

**materialqirl** (9.5): starting the album off STRONG

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): those fucking notes man

**puberty1** (9.5): :(

**twat\_brained** (9.5): If she said "step off the tour bus" like I first thought it was I'd be giving it a 10

**AnimationJava** (9): The whistlenotes on this still amaze me to this day.

**Awkward\_King** (9): remember that time they tried to make a fake feud between ariana and mariah lmao

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): Such a lovely song. The music is absolutely perfect and even though some of the lyrics are a little off, it still paints a beautiful picture in my mind. And dear god that Whistle note.

**bespectacIed** (9): Ariana's voice is the definition of "we have no choice but to stan"

**Brendon-Urine** (9): that outro is heavenly

**cremeebrulee** (9): i am not a ballad person but i have grown to appreciate this a ton. the whistle notes, the heartbreaking “imagine a world like that”, the instrumental… it’s a great opener

**george\_kaito** (9): the ending is so so pretty

**jayjaysortagay** (9): after listening to Taylor Snooze for an hour, this was the most exciting listening experience of my life. Its only less than a 10 because the overall quality of this rate is magnificent.

**ManofOranges** (9): In general this is a very nice song, and the better of the two popular songs named "imagine." I do have a few gripes here and there, like the build up with the whistle notes I don't think really pays off, at least the whistle notes sound nice though. It's a very nice opener at the very least.

**meiscool132** (9): I love the bittersweetness of this song so much, and it's really made for Ariana's voice. and we stan triggering my dog every time I listen to it and try doing the whistle notes.

**nooodisaster** (9): This song is probably the worst victim to Ariana-lyrics on the album ("we go like up till I'm sleep on your chest" ??? Fix it Jesus). But the producers did their goddamn JOB on this one, with a song I keep going back to. That last minute or so might be the most heavenly soundscape she's ever made.

**selegend** (9): ended john lemon

**SFbby** (9): The superior imagine

**static\_int\_husp** (9): really good vocals, the strings and whistles make it very pleasing to listen to

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): the superior imagine.

**waluigiest** (9): December 2018 when this song dropped was the last time I fully supported and loved ariana grande :-(

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): the perfect choice for a promo single

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.9): Amazing song! but, "bubbles and bubbly"? Seriously Ariana? Well at least that's how we know she did write something lol

**mms82** (8.8): love the beat in this song, the celebs should've sang this imagine

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): I like this song, I think it’s really good, but I never listen to it? It’s very impressive but in a way that’s kind of, like, exhausting just to hear. It’s like weight lifting. Also the shitpost is gonna be celebrities singing “Imagine” isn’t it?

**hawksband** (8.5): ari pls think before u click click click and post :(

**radiofan15** (8.5): Something something John Lennon something something hit his wife something something Gal Gadot..

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I like the juxtaposition of the trap beat, the orchestral instrumentation, and Ariana's soaring vocals. The song takes a while to really get interesting, but it's a solid track.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i had no idea she was capable of those whistle tones damn girl

**WeastofEden44** (8.3): Sis served VOCALS

**avenueroy** (8.2): Oh, I love this

deleted: **anagalisgv** (8): not the imagine we deserve, but the imagine we need

**anothertown** (8): I love the sparseness of this song, and how the end of each verse swings into the prechorus, into the chorus. The bridge is really abrupt though and I do always end up remembering this song as “the one with the whistle notes”

**bandnitos** (8): i am a whore for 3/4 time

**CarlieScion** (8): iiiiiimagine a world like thaaaaaaaaa

**cashewconstellation** (8): It's an entertaining song, kinda chill, I really liked it when it came out and it still holds up!

**cleen\_claire** (8): ari's vocals are unmatched

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is the song that I definitely need to be in the mood for, but the song is still really great and an appropriate opener for this dark album. What I like is how this song is supposed to be sexy, but the lyrics are low-key depressing. I feel your pain, Ariana. :(

**fadedblue09** (8): It’s a pretty decent moodsetter for the album, dark, minimalistic, and weirdly dissonant that displays the conflicting emotions Ariana has in the song.

**goldentayslight** (8): masterpiece omg sounds like it could've been a nice single

**ImADudeDuh** (8): one of the better songs on the album, but the outro goes on too long

**JanuaryFourteenth** (8): Better than the abuser

**leviswift13** (8): didn't hit for me until the album. still don't think it's the strongest opener, but the vocals and emotion are beautiful.

**rhyneston3** (8): John Lennon outsold, but Gal Gadot definitely didn't

**rsmitty99** (8): The chorus never did it for me. It feels empty. I get the minimilistic vibe. And the verse does well with this. But the chorus doesn't really build on it. However, I do lose it every time at those whistle notes. She really jumped away from them earlier in her career when the Mariah comparisons were relentless. I'm glad she brought it back.

**skargardin** (8): :nickising:

**Mysario** (7.9): John Lennon is shaking

**slazenger7** (7.6): Crazy vocals, but somehow feels six minutes long even though it's only three and a half.

**runaway3212** (7.5): This song is carried by Ariana's voice, but it's not bad at all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): This sounds nice but I hate how almost all of Ariana’s newer songs have slang in them bc they sound so awkward being sung? can u not say skkrt in your tragic love song please

**Anthony-Vince** (7): The song is good, but it's not my favorite. Love the whistle notes though.

**Evanbrooks324** (7): cute opener but was never a big fan of this song

**kappyko** (7): this is aight but i overrated it on the ph jukebox

**Kromorei** (7): aged like milk

**pearllouise** (7): John Legend is shaking in his graves. Edit: I just realized I mistyped John Lennon. I know I should erase it but it's too iconic to erase so I'll just leave it.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): liked this more at release but it's not that interesting in hindsight

**wavingwolves** (7): john lemon been real silent since this was released

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.6): I want to like it more, but it's a bit underwhelming

**akanewasright** (6.5): I like this song, but I’d never listen to it on its own, and some of the lyrics are clunky. I’m trying really hard to be fair to all the albums, okay

**ladililn** (6.5): I like to play this and 7 rings back to back so I can go straight from remembering that I’m alone to remembering that I'm poor.

**walkeddowntheblock** (6.5): The song is ok. Mostly I'd like to thank Ariana for introducing me to Pad Thai. ok, next.

**eeveefan01** (6): imaaaaagine a world where song titles had Caps

**lilacsweetener** (6): I don’t really enjoy listening to this but the emotional importance of this song to Ariana is very clear.

**dreamingoutloud92** (5): Hmmm. I like a lot of the lyrics, but the elongated pronunciation threw me off. Not sure it’s a great album opener?

**nick1372** (5): I don't think these a cappella intros are my thing, but this one isn't even as good as raindrops

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): Not my favourite. Kinda goes on for too long, but it's a good opener thematically

**vayyiqra** (5): :notes: Imagine there's no heaven

**Nickl00** (4): I really don’t get this song and don’t see much appeal besides the vocals

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): Repetitive, not memorable

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.6): i know this is a fan favorite but the melody in the chorus is SO aggravating to me

**anagalisgv** (10): i feel like i'm the only person who actually loved this

**CritneySpearz** (10): SLAPS, POPHEADS HAS NO TASTE IF THIS DOESN’T WIN BONUS RATE

**ggodisawomann** (10): love it

**mayolizard** (10): smash idc idc

**runaway3212** (10): The hate this song got is truly undeserved.

**mms82** (9.9): I get that it's super discombulated and three different songs but all 3 are awesome

**Mysario** (9.8): #JusticeForLDR in this rate! I actually really liked this movie even if it has a bunch of stupid "what a twist!" moments. This track too also slaps. Miley's verse is a great opener that slaps me, Lana's voice works so well as a bridge, and Ariana does a nice job filling in the gaps

**jayjaysortagay** (9): idgaf how much people clown on this, I love it and I know every single damn word.

**materialqirl** (9): the way this slapped but the movie flopped immmmm

**meiscool132** (9): it's not a 10 because there's an edit on YouTube that makes this song what it should've been, but still a great song please don't attack me

**sandyfishnets** (9): because of Lana

**hawksband** (8): i genuinely like this

**lapascalia** (8): I really like this song, I don’t get the hate over it!

**patcheso8** (8): a grower

**Austine567** (7.5): oh what could have and should have been

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This would have been better if they didn’t try to mash up all 3 of them together. Each of their parts work better on their own.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): this kinda grew on me, not really because it got better the more i listened to it, but mostly because i refuse to accept that this trio delivered just a subpar collaboration

**avenueroy** (7.4): I was actively avoiding this song since it was released, and I now know that was stupid, because this fucking slaps

**1998tweety** (7): I love Lana but this ain't it.

**axestogrind** (7): This is overhated it's literally fine

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): This song is NOT as bad as y'all make it out to be. It could have been better for sure but it's still pretty good.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): I always liked the beat on this song

**HolyGroundTS** (7): Lana Del Rey saved this song, whew chile

**nooodisaster** (7): even tho this

**pearllouise** (7): Mom says it's MY turn to criticize this song

**wasian-invasion** (7): drop it loowww lana woot

**puberty1** (6.5): look, this song is actually fine, but the gays were expecting this thing to be the song of the century which was never going to happen because the only great 3 pop girls feature we ever got was Lady Marmalade

**TiltControls** (6.5): I think Lana does fantastic here, but the other two end up being pretty forgettable

**asdivval** (6.4): crying for what could have been

**alwayswords** (6): love how lana’s verse just goes against what miley and ariana are saying

**bandnitos** (6): this is all for lana's verse that's the only good part

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): This is such a really messy collaboration. Despite being the main artist, Ariana feels out of place for this kind of song. Maybe it's her soft vocals and the lyrics. Lana's bridge alone is a 10.

**franch** (6): i wanted this to be better than it was

**Tedyonce** (6): I DROP IT DOWN I PICK IT UP something something OVER THE COUNTY LINE

**vayyiqra** (6): ok I won't then I promise

**wardrum5** (6): It's three different demos slapped together

**WeastofEden44** (6): The beat is as plastic as the ass I have in my dreams

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): the charlie’s angels soundtrack was nowhere near as bad as the sub says it was. that said this song was a huge mess & felt like the one true mistake in ariana’s 2019 run

**radiofan15** (5.5): I really LIKE and also really DISLIKE DCMA. I love most of its parts individually... but together the song is a fucking mess.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): it's not that bad, it's just aggressively mediocre with the exception of Lana's bridge which is pretty transcendent

**static\_int\_husp** (5.5): I love how Ari and Miley bring like 110% intensity to this song then they just stick Lana's xanax voice into the bridge

**abysmalglimmer** (5): ehh I don’t hate it as much as I should

**cremeebrulee** (5): this song is a mess lmfao i think i listened to it that first time it came out and never went near it again.

**Kromorei** (5): poor miley and lana

**Nickl00** (5): I don’t think it’s terrible, but it’s such a missed opportunity for everyone involved

**rotating3Dtext** (5): mm wasted potential?

**Tolk1en** (5): I would like to say this song is overhated but I won't pretend it's good, especially compared to the talent of the 3 artists

**waluigiest** (5): I love how unimportant this crossover ended up being lol

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): I don’t really like this song but somehow find myself putting it on repeat sometimes

**AnimationJava** (4.5): I, like a lot of people on popheads, felt let-down by this collab. What mainly saved the song for me was Lana's bridge.

**cashewconstellation** (4): what the fuck is that

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4): I'm unsure how to feel about this being Lana's biggest hit in a hot minute.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Lana’s part is bad, sorry guys, it is. She sounds cool but she’s out of place and she’s singing about dropping it low in a song that shouldn’t be about dropping it low.

**Johnnytoby** (4): lana is the only reason this song is not a one

**shesdoingyoga** (4): The chord progression (or lack thereof) in this is so boring, there is barely any real movement and that makes it difficult to listen to

**skargardin** (4): disjointed mess

**wavingwolves** (4): the only good thing this brought us was that one thread where ppl thought max martin died

**FluffyNobody** (3.5): Marginal improvement over boyfriend

**PointlessBibliophage** (3.5): if only we were judging just lana's part

**E3-NotTheConvention** (3): A hot , such wasted potential

**hadea0090** (3): lana's verse is....

**hockey\_newfoundland** (3): The most disappointing crossover since

**leviswift13** (3): i unforunately have heard this song.

**NotWith10000Men** (3): remember when we thought this was gonna be good?

**RandomHypnotica** (3): I have an edit of this that is literally just Lana's bridge and I listen to that part on it's own. The rest actively takes away from that

**Stryxen** (3): I have to laugh

**vhqv1997** (3): Whatever each of them is singing sounds like a really good song. Not what they all sing together though.

**Awkward\_King** (2): it's a 7 if you play from 1:56 onwards

**bespectacIed** (2): biggest pop implosion of all time

**CarlieScion** (2): who the fuck thought this song was good enough to release

**cleen\_claire** (2): i started laughing when this played oml it's so funny

**nick1372** (2): Absolutely nothing about this song makes sense. Lana is singing about TWERKING for fuck's sake.

**fadedblue09** (1): Anyway, stream Feel Good Time by P!nk for the superior Charlie's Angels song.

**frogaranaman** (1): nothing about this song is redeemable

**ImADudeDuh** (1): when everyone was so hyped for this and then it was awful :gaga:

**ManofOranges** (1): Just a mess. They probably tried to have some kind of Lady Marmalade type moment but they missed the mark by about a light year. I understand some people think Lana's verse is the best part of this song, but I disagree, I think they're all just equally bad in their own right. The best part of this song is when it's not playing.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): they see demon, I see angel, angel, angel

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): Ariana what the actual fuck is this?

**RosaPalms** (1): can I really not use my 0 in the bonus rate? This is one of the worst songs I've ever heard.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i hate lana del rey

Lizzo has done a phenomenal job at making everyone think they are amazing and cute. Everyone last year thought they were 100% that bitch, and no one really disagreed. That’s Lizzo’s power, anyone can be 100% that bitch and feel good saying it. I said it yesterday, but her themes as an artist have been so amazingly consistent, it is such a pleasure to just hear about Lizzo and hear from her. She is just so positive and a joy to listen to and see on my timeline (as long as it isn’t people making fun of her weight, grow up). 

---

**Austine567** (11): come lizzo is that bitch

**bandnitos** (10): my friends and i made this our anthem right before this blew up so its special to me

**bespectacIed** (10): Still amazing after all the overplaying. I'm glad for what this song brought to Lizzo's career, she deserves everything.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): idc if it's overplayed and old it still SLAPS and was absolutely my anthem when i ended my first long-term relationship lmao

**cremeebrulee** (10): yes this is another songs that’s been overplayed, but i think like tun the song, it truly was A Moment so i’m gonna give it a 10 for that

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The only acceptable minimum score for this song is 10 and that's the tea.

**gannade** (10): im a bad bitch

**hikkaru** (10): basic bitch anthem yup yup

**imasalesman** (10): AB6IX did it better

**J\_Toe** (10): I love the literal lyric video for this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0xPBl7PECU

**Jimmy345960** (10): still gotta give my baby a ten

**Johnnytoby** (10): it's a really great karaoke song yall, just dont say the n word yall (or curse words if that's ur vibe grandma)

**leviswift13** (10): i mean it's a classic luv

**lilacsweetener** (10): Unbelievable from start to finish every line is a sucker punch to the face. Try listening with fresh ears because this is a lyrical masterpiece. Also those background harmonies.

**mayolizard** (10): woah vicky smash video

**meiscool132** (10): it never gets old for me

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): we just keep it pushin like ay ay ay

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I was afraid I was gonna be sick of this song but it still sounds as good as ever.

**nick1372** (10): ok listen I was very confised about how this one, out of all Lizzo singles, was her breakout. She's had better vocals and more original melodies. But every single lyric on this is unforgetabble, even the bum bum bay shit. Every line in this song has been used on some rich girl's insta vacation photos and that's why it will last forever.

**patcheso8** (10): another 11 contender. It's so fun!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): iconic

**redgold51** (10): As overplayed as this song was, I still have never gotten bored of singing along to every word

**RosaPalms** (10): I know we're all sick to death of this song but the shit goes off

**rsmitty99** (10): A classic

**skargardin** (10): it's not hard to see why this was her breakthrough hit, it slaps hard

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i think this song is considered pretty "local" at this point on the subreddit but i'm still super happy it got so big

**wardrum5** (10): I was gonna give it a nine but literally every single line is iconic

**wavingwolves** (10): i don't care if people think this is corny i still love to sing along to it

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): the way she commanded our attention and our coin with this bop

**Mysario** (9.8): one of 2019's Grammy award-winning top songs being from 2017 either tells you the quality of this song... or the quality of the songs that came out in 2019. or even the standards of the Grammy's

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this blowing up was such a surprise but felt so right

**radiofan15** (9.5): I can't wait for the Kim Petras/Doja Cat-loving white twinks to sink this one because it topped the Billboard charts in a way those twinks haven't been topped in a while...

**slazenger7** (9.4): Biggest song of the year for a reason.

**akanewasright** (9): Every line of this song is iconic.

**anagalisgv** (9): so overplayed at this point but still slaps

**AnimationJava** (9): Iconic for simply being the Lizzo song that put her on the map.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): The little song that could. I'm still not as sick of this song as everyone else is.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): I don't understand how this is the song of hers that got big. Not because I dislike it, but of all songs, this one?

**eeveefan01** (9): Took a DNA test turns out izza bop

**franch** (9): this is a bop for sure. not sure if it's the old "couple bangers on an album of filler" formula or just a little lizzo goes a long way for me.

**hawksband** (9): hate this song sm

**ImADudeDuh** (9): its a bop! This is gonna be day 1 cause ppl will complain about overplay, ugh.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% a Lizzo stan

**Kanne\_** (9): the line about the sidechick, yes

**Kromorei** (9): good fucking food

**pearllouise** (9): Yeah gunshots are painful but have you ever been hit with the truth? (that was probably a very unfunny attempt at humor but hey fuck it)

**ReallyCreative** (9): a tad tired of this song, the lyrics are still everything and I've watched enough live performances to know that Lizzo will always deliver

**waluigiest** (9): at the end of 2018 I made a playlist with the kind of music I wanted to listen to in 2019 and this song was on it and whew my mind!!!

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8.8): still holds up well (all these years later lmfao)

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'm not giving this my 11 again but I will certainly continue to slightly nod my head or my foot along when it comes on the radio. But it's on the radio too much. Why did we decry Sue Sylvester marrying herself in 2010 when Lizzo does it herself in the video?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I like this song but also it’s grating sometimes. Idk if it cause it’s overplayed but it’s a shrinker for me

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): The plunky saloon piano gets really annoying after hearing this song multiple times a day every day on the radio at work, but the lyrics and her delivery are the strong part of the song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): probably the most overplayed song in this rate, but it’s still a good song and i’d rather have good songs overplayed than bad ones.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): even through all the overplay, perfect karaoke song

**fadedblue09** (8.4): Please don't drag this. It's actually very good.

**WeastofEden44** (8.1): This song grew on me but like every other Lizzo song deserved the hype this song got more lol

**Clearer-Skies** (8): a smash for a reason

**cleen\_claire** (8): This was a hit for a reason!

**george\_kaito** (8): JUST TOOK A DNA TEST TURNS OUT IM 100% THAT BITCH!!

**Nickl00** (8): I honestly liked it more the more popular it got and it’s nice that a Lizzo song is so popular

**nooodisaster** (8): I feel like I'm annoyed of this song now, but gotta give it this score bc of the times I've had.

**rhyneston3** (8): Overplay has definitely ruined it but that BET performance is GOAT

**runaway3212** (8): I never got the hype around this one, but it's still pretty good.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): I understand why her old songs are more popular than the ones she wrote for the album, they far more catchier and memorable

**untutorable** (8): her other singles outsold imo but this still hits

deleted: 
**ManofOranges** (7.5): I know I'm not the first to say that truth hurts is not the best that Lizzo has to offer but I will say it anyway. I think on the radio this song can stand on its own but like in the context of this album, where you have song like Juice, Water Me, Boys, etc., it just isn't up to par.

**hadea0090** (7): even karens love it

**kappyko** (7): overplayed but this is good for a bit

**RandomHypnotica** (7): Who knew one line and a netflix movie was all it took to make a song blow up?

**TiltControls** (7): It's iconic for sure, but that might be all it has going for it. Juice does this better in almost every way

**FluffyNobody** (6.5): this gets better the more you play it, but still, it's not my jam. Also, the kid bops version ended men and outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I hate that this was her big hit, she has so many good songs that aren’t just yelling

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): This song really peaks with the first line and doesn't really go anywhere. It's an actual SHAME that none of the songs from the standard edition of the album achieved the commercial success of Truth Hurts.

**JanuaryFourteenth** (6): I just took a DNA test turns out I’m 100% a Black Beatle

**materialqirl** (6): this song just took a DNA test and came out overrated

**NotWith10000Men** (6): so beyond done with this song but I still like it

**Stryxen** (6): it’s fine but I wish she broke out for a different song

**vayyiqra** (6): I JUST TOOK A DNA TEST TURNS OUT Around 1–4% of all non-Subsaharan African genomes (Eurasians, Oceanians, Native Americans, and North Africans) derive from Neanderthals

**1998tweety** (5.5): Another song where I'll be linking my jukebox review instead. It has grown on me though which is why my score is higher.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): It’s catchy and rather pleasant

**vhqv1997** (4): A string of Instagram captions doesn't make a song good. I like the bars she threw here but the song is really bare-bones and there isn't much exciting about it. Might as well watch her hold a TED talk instead.

**frogaranaman** (3): another Lizzo song I shotgunned a White Claw to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): im so tired of hearing this

**ggodisawomann** (2): stop it, I didn't care for this when it came out and the fact that this is the song that made her famous and that she's known for...PLEASE

=====

kappyko: fwiw the beginning of my comment refers to how many songs it’s been since cuz i love you went out i’m in this thread late

you’re right about it being a pattern. i’m not going to be naïve and pretend Lizzo being black doesn’t play a role in how people address her music and there is a lot of ignorance in the lower scores. i think part of my qualms are just how it feels like it’s being co-opted in bad faith rather than actually being the source of like an actual conversation re: how people are addressing Lizzo’s music and how it *sounds.*
[/r/popheads/comments/gll3dy/the_2019_main_pop_girls_rate_day_3_well_its_lover/fqyr7vl/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Okay. As a non-black POC, this is a fair criticism. But there are a lot of comments on Lizzo's other songs where she was called "loud". But the thing is that she wasn't even that "loud" on those songs, whatever the definition of "loud" is.  

Perhaps this is where my frustration came from but this shouldn't be applied for Cuz I Love You (the song) cause the production is intended to be loud. I apologize to the people who commented on the song as "loud" but didn't on other songs.

What a strange driving force to a new era. It cemented her place as a main pop girl in 2019, and it all started on a Saturday night to coincide with ex, Pete Davidson appearing on SNL and the drama of their break up. The entire era felt strange and rushed at first, but it turns out there was a full plan behind the release, and lead to her first #1. It was the benchmark for her most successful era, several Grammy nominations, and one of the strangest arena tours and led to the discussion of the prioritization of profit over mental health in the music industry again. 

---

**bulforster** (11): Her best song and the song that cemented her as an icon.

**gannade** (11): yes im a twink, thank u next.

**mms82** (11): fantastic. so poignant, what a cultural moment. also the perfect song for when it came out in my life dealing with a super loving breakup for the first time so itll always hold a special part in my heart for that. there's not many songs that capture that feeling so perfectly, and I love this song for that

**nooodisaster** (11): ;_; When this dropped it was a revelation, and it's still a beacon as the effective closer to the album. The extremely personal yet raw and relatable lyrics combined with pitch perfect melodies. The chill production matched with an iceberg of emotional weight underneath. A rare chart topper that was 100% quality, and I've loved it ever since.

**radiofan15** (11): Not the greatest song on the rate... but even I can't deny that the release of this song was a CULTURAL RESET, a moment in history... she truly did THAT

**akanewasright** (10): Perfect ending to a masterful album. This album is much greater than the sum of its parts. Honest to God, this is the only great song that could be released as a single from this album. I like ALMOST all of the other songs (fuck you buwyg), but it’s them connecting to this song in the end that makes the album great.

**alwayswords** (10): cultural reset

**Anthony-Vince** (10): I can objectively appreciate this song, its lyrics and its cultural impact, but I don't listen to it much anymore just because I think I overplayed it.

**Awkward\_King** (10): theres a reason its her first number one and her staple song

**bespectacIed** (10): Her first number 1!!! This song's special to my heart because the circumstances that led to the release of this song are huge moments in pop history. It's heartfelt, if not lyrically and sonically impressive. Love ariana to bits

**cashewconstellation** (10): It's great!

**cleen\_claire** (10): i still listen to this on an almost daily basis

**cremeebrulee** (10): high? yeah but this song was literally a cultural reset so i’ll give it what it deserves

**cyborglilith** (10): iconic

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely one of the contenders for my 11. What makes this song great is that this is a huge statement of how she was feeling. Her ex-boyfriend died, she broke up with her fiance. Her fans disliked Sweetener despite critical acclaim from critics. She was torn and mentally exhausted as a person. What a better way than to write those feelings and make it an empowering anthem? This is obviously a classic and I am sure this is going to be the song that people will think of first when Ariana is mentioned. This could have been the perfect closer to the album.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): loved this song when it came out, a very good lead single to the album of what it represents

**fadedblue09** (10): An instant classic. The perfect thesis statement to the album, and maybe even her artistry in general.

**franch** (10): this deserves a 10 alone for her subtweet of Pete tbh...

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Not to meme but like, a literal cultural reset. I really think that this was the foghorn that ushered the return of pure pop music that we’re currently seeing on the charts. This is unquestionably one of the best songs in the rate, I’m still amazed by how maturely the song handles a tricky situation and how original and organic it feels. Whatever else can be said about how messy all of the stuff that followed in the *thank u, next* era, this will forever be a flawless pop culture moment.

**hunnybee12** (10): almost my 11. truly a one-of-a-kind pop culture moment. and it feels like authentic ariana in every single way.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): ughhhh so beautiful I wish we could all be this mature after a breakup.

**Johnnytoby** (10): even locals like this, a classic

**JunkyGS** (10): a cultural reset

**leviswift13** (10): signature song stuff!!

**lilacsweetener** (10): Obviously a career defining song and moment. She took back her narrative and disallowed gossip in a way that dehumanised her. She reminded everyone she’s a person and that all good comes with bad, it’s a learning experience no matter what. Maybe she snapped.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song really is great. I am reluctant to call it genius but everything about it is just very very smart. The lyrics and the sound of it in context of when it was released, it's just a very good move to make. Couple that with the fact that the song already sounds nice, it's definitely a gem.

**mayolizard** (10): Cultural reset!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): A song of hope and seeing the bright side of the end of the tunnel. Really makes me feel good in these exhausting and terrifying times.

**nick1372** (10): a once in a lifetime song. one of those cultural moments that will be remembered for decades.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I thought after all this time I'd be tired of this song… but I ain't

**redgold51** (10): The genius of this song is insane!

**rsmitty99** (10): Depending on where this falls on this rate, I mentioned I went through a break up a few months before the release of this album. My ex broke up with me the day this song was released. So naturally, this song was played 50 times that day. It really put a positive spin on losing a guy I really cared about. I never went through a break up before so I never connected truly with break up songs. So this will always be that first song that "got me through it". It deserves an 11. But Cruel Summer is just that song. Sorry Ari.

**runaway3212** (10): Ariana had made good songs before, she had even made great songs, but this was truly her first amazing song.

**skargardin** (10): still slaps as hard as it did on its release date

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this song also follows up the previous three so well. such a cultural moment. iconic.

**twat\_brained** (10): the winner will either be this or Juice. It'll be close but I'm expecting this to be right up there.

**untutorable** (10): a banger through and through

**wasian-invasion** (10): this'll be a 2010s classic, definitely her defining song

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): a career defining song, it's flawless

deleted: **LeninaCrowne94** (9.7): I'm so fucking grateful for this song

**Mysario** (9.7): my favourite thing about this song isn't how personal it is or how quick it came out or how great this is as a song, but it's the music video that references Mean Girls, Bring It On, 13 Going on 30, and Legally Blonde. besides them all starring women, what's the theme? there's no reason for it. it's great!

**anothertown** (9.5): :nicki voice: i hate, hate, HATE that this isn't the last song on the album

**materialqirl** (9.5): solid lead single

**WeastofEden44** (9.5): This song blew me a way when I first heard it and it still does... after not listening to it for like 9 months lol

**1998tweety** (9): Another song where imma just slap a high score on it and head out. I really don't wanna read the comments for the 1s and 0s and whatever mess gannade typed up saying that Ari is taking advantage of her ex's death.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): a good choice for the lead single but I have always thought this was slightly overrated but I appreciate the song still.

**meiscool132** (9): iconic song, iconic video, iconic moment in history

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song still hits a little different as someone who has really been interested in Ariana's persona and trajectory as much as her music. This song could get robbed but it's a treat and a standout in this rate.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): i’m not sure that it has withstood the test of time all that well, but boy what a moment this was

**Stryxen** (8.9): can’t relate but same

**JanuaryFourteenth** (8.5): Self-reflection is always a fun song concept for the listener

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): iconic moment in music history but tbh also a bit weaker than the rest of the album

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): Not my favorite but she really needed to make this song and I'm happy for her success with it.

**CarlieScion** (8): a cultural moment

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): This should have been her biggest hit.

**eeveefan01** (8): a good lead, it came and went though

**FluffyNobody** (8): the tweet is honestly more iconic than the song

**george\_kaito** (8): why is the genius page so long

**Nickl00** (8): it’s a really good single that should’ve been the closure

**RandomHypnotica** (8): it's good sure but not the best on the album.

**waluigiest** (8): I want to go back to the joy that I felt when I heard this song for the first month after it came out

**wavingwolves** (8): tbh i love the "at least this song is a smash" thing. it's bold and it paid off

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.8): Simple, catchy and honest

**slazenger7** (7.2): As a cultural touchstone: priceless. As a song: meh.

**bandnitos** (7): it's boring tbh but it's alright

**muchopartymuchomoney** (7): cute and i'm glad she got her long awaited first #1 with this, but it's kinda overrated and i'm tired of it for now

**pearllouise** (7): I'm not a regular song, I'm a cool song

**puberty1** (7): overplayed as all hell but probably my favorite lead single of hers

**rhyneston3** (7): Great lyrics, but the melody gets a little tiresome after a while

**vhqv1997** (7): Bacon eggs

**AnimationJava** (6.5): A chill r&b song that will almost definitely become Ariana's legacy.

**hadea0090** (6.5): I liked it when it first came out but it lowkey aged like milk and i didn't even play it that much

**plantp0wer** (6.5): the self love in this song is sweet. I don’t really get how this song became a hit though

**TiltControls** (6.5): sweet, but I wish she did a little more with the chorus

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): Lyrically this is really good, but not a single thing about the production grabs me or makes me interested in hearing it again

**ggodisawomann** (6): this is okay but this album is full of way better songs

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its alright

**Jimmy345960** (6): This one was overrplayed but I liked it when it first came out.

**kappyko** (6): eh

**Kromorei** (6): boring, actually. not gonna lie.

**Kanne\_** (5.5): idc for tu,n i'm sorry

**frogaranaman** (5): never really liked this song, lmao

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): Okay, I've never liked that one. Naming your exes is mean spirited and tacky and if anyone other than miss Manchester Bombing Victim had done it, people would lose their minds.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.3): grew on me a bit after my breakup but still ultimately just bland and overhyped

**PoppyPigglet** (4): The entire ariana/pete saga was so weird and the context of this release is kinda off-putting for this song.

**strangergravityfalls** (4): please don't make me feel sorry for pete davidson, i do not like that feeling

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i genuinely can’t tell if this song is supposed to be sarcastic or not

**vayyiqra** (2): I really cannot get into this song because I admit I totally misinterpreted it the first time I heard it - I thought it was a bragging kind of narcissist song about how she used all these men and discarded them. Of course, it's not like that at all and is quite a wholesome song, but the damage was done. As well, I just find the chorus annoying. There's my biased reasoning for tanking its score, lest I be accused of sabotage.

**animefangrant62** (1): (I don't like Mean Girls and nothing you gays can say will change that.)

**TragicKingdom1 (1): giving this a 1 because moderating it was a nightmare**

#taylor leaked the call to promo The Man

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Look sis, we don't know if Taylor actually leaked that phone call. I would like to definitely believe that Kris Jenner might be involved with this. I mean, the week the full phone call was leaked was the same week that the latest season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premiered. If anything, Ms. Jenner is trying to get material for the next season. Anyways, I am so glad what Taylor said turned out to be true all this time. When that snippet of the phone call leaked back in 2016, I was initially disappointed in her to the point of unstanning her. It's crazy that I considered cutting out a huge portion of my life just over that. As we get to know the circumstances of that phone call in the years that followed, including Scotter's involvement and Kanye involved in the feud with Drake and Pusha T, there is no way to conclude other than Kanye is a fucking rat. And that's on period.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I don't think she leaked it personally, but it's still an iconic moment that's absolutely worth it even if it gives Swifties literal years of ammo to infantize her and absolve her of any criticism

**LeninaCrowne94** (8): I don't think she was the one who leaked it, but we all needed some celebrity drama

**Nivster** (8): she did not though.

**RosaPalms** (8): TIL Taylor is Kris Jenner

**runaway3212** (8): did taylor leak it? I thought it just got leaked. Anyway it was pretty entertaining to see she was right all this time.

**vhqv1997** (4): Did Taylor really leak it because I don't think we have any proof of that. Either way, the original controversy was fun and juicy, every following iteration of it is just dumb.

# #kanyewestisoverparty

**jimmy345960** (11): this is almost as iconic as every kanye/kim stan in that thread saying they were "so over it" but had a fucking field day in 2016. Weren't over it then sweaty.

**1998tweety** (10): she was ALWAYS right, eat SHIT kanye stans especially [redacted] you know who you are

**evanbrooks324** (10): (11 if we can??) *(ricki note: you were able to but i didnt read comments until now so rip)*

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSTN3mHEAOA

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Who had this? Why did it take so long? It's sad because the damage was already done and when it came out, all this got was a 'who cares? Get over it!' And I mean it's true we should be focusing on bigger issues but it really just comes off as unfortunate for her.

# #taylorseiftisoverparty

**wavingwolves** (4): [jojo's voice] it's just a little too late

**Agusarg** (6): It was an old drama by that point, and people once again tried to cancel Kanye when it's just not going to happen.

**mudkip1** (3): so stale

**fadedblue09** (2): Imagine how tired we are. Glad she didn't make it much of a big deal this time though.

**lilacsweetener** (1): huh???

[Well it’s (l)over](https://youtu.be/ZbwDdljoZ8c). This started the rate on top and for a long time it was able to keep the spot, but as more submissions came, it kept on dropping, even at one point being outside of the Top 10. A painful journey to witness.

*Lover* feels like the song Taylor’s entire career was leading to. From her beginnings she was writing about relationships and heartache, and she mastered it quickly, writing some of the best breakup songs in recent years, but her love songs were lacking a bit. She had nice songs about love, like *Love Story* or *Mine*, but they usually were on someone else’s perspective, or about a crush, or the beginning stages of a relationship, she didn’t have a song about just being in love and just wanting to be with that person forever ^(and ever) ^^and ^^ah , and after a decade of working as a songwriter,whatever was going to fill that void in her discography ought to be a masterpiece, and boy did she deliver.

There’s not a single miss in this track. Its sound is one of the most interesting she has in her repertoire, giving a dreamy, timeless vibe with  the reverbed instrumental and soft vocals, and the lyrics are pure poetry. It describes being in love in the most intimate way, appreciating the small details that makes you adore your significant other so deeply. Having followed her career for so long and cried to her saddest songs, I can’t help but truly enjoy listening to her being so sincerely happy ~~and it also makes me want to be able to relate to it someday~~. ^(someone please date me)

---

**JunkyGS** (11): One of her best songs, I know this won't win due to people sabotaging but whatever it honestly deserves.

**Mazike** (11): iconic legendary bop of the century

**Nivster** (11): Absolutely beautiful. A classic for centuries to come

**patcheso8** (11): among my favorites of hers EVER. This is so sweet and lovely.

**redgold51** (11): Taylor’s all-time best track !

**1998tweety** (10): Okay now this is perfection. This song is so damn cute and feels genuine. Lowkey should've been the 5th song cause it fits a lot more than The Archer. Taylor knows how to nail a bridge and Lover is no exception, she brings the song up to the amazing climax, really driving home the feelings conveyed.

**Agusarg** (10): One of her best songs, so beautiful

**alwayswords** (10): lover is to love songs is what all too well is to breakup songs

**Awkward\_King** (10): should've pushed this harder at xmas it's phenomenal

**bandnitos** (10): i almost cried to this at my homecoming dance

**bespectacIed** (10): "All's well that ends well to end up with you" - proof of Taylor's songwriting genius when she actually cared enough to show it in this album

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Why couldn't the entire album be like this, dammit? Just her, singing honest songs about love? It's not rocket science! She nails it!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Listening to this song, you can tell how much Taylor has matured since her early days, especially her perspective on romance. In Love Story, Taylor fantasizes a Romeo and Juliet romance with a fairy-tale happy ending. In Lover, Taylor sings about a more realistic kind of love story where she finds romance in the most mundane things like leaving the Christmas lights until January (For Filipinos, it's up to March) and admits that she is insecure with people around her lover. It's a plus that Taylor wrote this song alone so this is really coming from her. The fact that Lover has an old-timey appeal means this song is already a new classic and it's definitely going to be played in generations to come. Props to Taylor and Jack Antonoff for having the idea of the song to be played with instructions made before the 70s.

**dreamingoutloud92** (10): Who else cried the first time you saw the music video?

**eeveefan01** (10): An amazing single, how to right a love song

**FluffyNobody** (10): This is truly timeless, a wedding song for the ages. I can understand why she considers it her best song

**george\_kaito** (10): lover (first dance remix) outsold but this is such a sweet, wholesome song. a classic.

**hikkaru** (10): :comfy:

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I remember I first didn’t like this song, but I grew on me over time and warmed my cold heart. It’s one of my favourites from her and it’s the perfect winter time vibes.

**J\_Toe** (10): lol, remember that thread where r/popheads was like 'Lover really reminds me of Christmas, I have no idea why' and it's like, the first lyric literally mentions Christmas

**Jimmy345960** (10): I don't have a strong connection to this song yet. I understand the message of Daylight a lot more. I hope as time goes on I can understand what she is going through. I am giving this a ten out of hope of a happy future in this crazy life.

**leviswift13** (10): so close to an 11. this will be my first dance song when i marry my boyfriend. it's just a perfectly crafted piece of music. so many killer lyrics, but i have a special place in my heart for "there's a dazzling way, a mysterious haze about you, dear/have i known you twenty seconds or twenty years?" the chorus is a wedding classic for the ages.

**MaximumFriendship** (10): this song makes me so sad that I am single, but also so happy that someone can feel love rn

**mayolizard** (10): Wow this instrumental. Holy shit! I love everything about this song.

**nick1372** (10): Taylor's best bridge maybe ever?

**pearllouise** (10): My non-existent husband walked me down the aisle to this song.

**SFbby** (10): Makes me wish I had a lover :'(

**shaniquasharkesha** (10): I will play this at my wedding don't come for me

**skargardin** (10): what a sweet song, if only the whole album was filled with this type of serene love songs. The bridge is among my favorite parts of the album, period

**Stryxen** (10): this is like her favourite track and I get it it’s cute

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): the only Taylor Swift song I could ever give a 10 too. immaculate songwriting.

**TiltControls** (10): Just by listening to this song I have achieved love. There is nothing else to do. This song provides the full romantic experience.

**twat\_brained** (10): It's like a new and improved version of Thinking Out Loud without Ed's tacky or shouty lyrics and no pointless filler guitar solo. A lovely song which only a lover could write. This might just be the song to help convert me into a Swiftie once and for all.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): Sounds like a classic, it's simple but beautifully conveys the feeling of contented and settled love

**wavingwolves** (10): i resent this song for making me feel like a shell of a human being for never experiencing this kind of love but i'm choosing to forgive and move on. the "at every table i'll save you a seat'' line hits like a million bricks falling over my head and makes me want to cry in a corner while drunk

deleted: **franch** (9.5): i can't give a song with the word "LOVER" in the chorus a 10

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9.5): This feels like the high school slow dance with the person you’ve been flirting with for years and finally got the courage to ask out. It just fucking SOARS.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): this was such a return to form ugh

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9.5): Easily the best song on the album. Why it wasn't the blueprint for the entire album baffles me.

**Mysario** (9.4): wicked cute song

**radiofan15** (9.3): If this was the remix with the strings this would be an easy 10

**slazenger7** (9.2): Not something that's talked about much, but this would have made so much sense as a lead single as a way of introducing the new era instead of a late-breaking single at release. Then follow up with Cruel Summer instead of YNTCD...sigh.

**Anthony-Vince** (9): Beautiful song, not quite as replay-able as other but great songwriting and melody.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): Cutest song on the album. The bridge gets a little cringey but man the rest of the song makes up for it.

**berober04** (9): My fiancee will kill me if I don't rate this any lower than a 9

**CritneySpearz** (9): it's cute actually, and this is coming from a single cold hearted gay

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9): One of the best songs she's ever made

**fadedblue09** (9): Cute, but let’s be honest: Ed Sheeran can make a song like this and y’all be trashing it.

**lapascalia** (9): This song really grew on me, it’s so lovely.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This is really cute.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the shawn version is literally a 2

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song grew on me as I went through my first relationship this past fall. I think I kinda finally get the feelings of love and longing and even though the relationship is over, I can appreciate this song a lot more, and it is a really really good song, among Taylor's best.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This is just such an adorable song and a pretty picture of a happy relationship that I actually get a bit annoyed when I listen to it

**static\_int\_husp** (9): the only think that irks me is the way she says "lover" otherwise it's a cute bop

**vhqv1997** (9): The second verse is a bit lyrically whack but the chorus and the overall melody saved it

**waluigiest** (9): it’s warm and lovely. What a world we’d be in if this had been the lead single....

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is a genuinely beautiful, and enchanting record. I love everything about it. It makes me happy, what else can I say?

**materialqirl** (8.5): cute

**mms82** (8.5): queen of making calling someone your lover not totally creepy

**muchopartymuchomoney** (8.5): i found it boring the first time i listened to it, but now i like it

**rsmitty99** (8.5): As far as ballads go, it's sweet. It's hard for me. I grew up with 90s ballads from women who could sing you through the wall. So I always have that expectation going into ballads and it's turned me off from artists like Taylor, Selena Gomez, Billie Eillish, etc. doing ballads. But this is why I think Taylor is one of the most ingenious songwriters. This is a rare ballad by a non-vocalist that catches my ear. The production is so lush and effective. I know I sound like a rolling stone critic and probably you stopped reading 2 sentences ago. But I haven't listened to this album in maybe a year and I'm really appreciating it. Plus I'm bored at work.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): my boyfriend loves this song so tbh it'll probably be played at my wedding. also one of Taylor's best music videos!

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8.5): i don't think it'll be a classic like her fans do, but I do like the song

**cleen\_claire** (8): Taylor somehow managed to make the word "lover" cute we love

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this had to grow on me, but it did eventually grow on me!

**jayjaysortagay** (8): of the songs I already know from this album, this is the best by far. I don't really like the vocal production but everything else is beautiful.

**mudkip1** (8): cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is cute

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the only song on this album to succeed at being an authentic love song

**wasian-invasion** (8): taylor who doesn’t leave the christmas lights up till january its only one week

**WeastofEden44** (8): This is the most overrated song of last year, I said it. We all know that if Shawn Mendes sang this y'all would say it's the most boring basic shit alive. It still slaps tho

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.6): Old Taylor lives

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): It's nice!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): It's nice but it gives me perhaps unintended christmas song vibes

**runaway3212** (7.5): Amazing lyrically, but I'm not the biggest fan of it sound-wise

**agentofscranton** (7): yes i WILL be playing this at my wedding. yes i AM basic.

**Evanbrooks324** (7): a cute ballad but overrated tbh

**hadea0090** (7): I like it.

**hunnybee12** (7): mazzy star legends https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImKY6TZEyrI

**nooodisaster** (7): youre my, my, my, my................ liver.

**xosam** (6.5): I don't really get the hype of this song, maybe it just isn't my style but Lover personally does nothing for me.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): this would be much higher but that line about the christmas lights… girl leaving them up for a week or two after christmas is normal the symbolism doesn’t work

**anagalisgv** (6): it's sweet but so boring

**CarlieScion** (6): this is NOT that great lyrically, no matter what stans say!!! It’s lovely melodically tho

**ggodisawomann** (6): this is not as good as everyone makes it out to be butttt still not a bad song! I do bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): It’s meh, I’ve heard this kind of song better from other people. Once again we have a song with potential that Taylor just isn’t equipped to deliver, she sounds particularly annoying on the chorus of this song. I wish she’d give more of her songs away to other singers because someone like CRJ or Alessia Cara could have done something with this.

**kappyko** (6): yay

**ManofOranges** (6): So, from what I recall, when this came out some people were really in love with this song, and.... why? I think this song is, for lack of a better word, boring. Like I understand that the girl is in love and it's very that, but you know what I've never been in love, so I don't know what that's like! Also I'm not really a fan of Taylor's falsetto. So, I don't hate the song, but I'm certainly not in love with it.

**Nickl00** (6): I really loved this song for a while but the more I listened to it the less I like it

**rhyneston3** (6): I love Thinking Out Loud Part 2: White woman edition

**strangergravityfalls** (6): imagine if this had a good bridge

**untutorable** (6): i hate the word lover i absolutely despise it, it sounds so weird to me! it's a good song but i docked points for how much she says lover in this song. idk what i expected tho it is called lover

**anothertown** (5): taylor swift will get married in a barn

**Johnnytoby** (5): sh(y)awn mendes

**Kromorei** (5): i think i've heard more entertaining noise coming from drying paint

**puberty1** (5): i know this will most likely get top 5 but it's just too straight for me sorry

**Brendon-Urine** (4): Never understood why people went crazy for this one :/

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Mind-numbingly BORING, but at the same time The "MY MY MY LUVAH" part is irritating as fuck. The sentiment is what saves this song from being a total dud.

**vayyiqra** (4): I have a problem with this song. First of all, I don't like the word "lover" - irrational, but it makes me cringe. Secondly, I don't like the doo-wop kind of feel it has, or the slide guitar, and find it kind of cute but basic. I guess it's okay, but not good enough to be a title track.

**Sliemy** (3): I generally love ballads, but Lover honestly drags out a little bit too much for me, and Taylor isn't a strong enough singer to really make me invested into it so I generally get sleepy listening to it. The Shawn remix is alright for me though.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.2): loser

**AnimationJava** (0): Honestly kinda was underwhelmed at first but now I find the slow beat of the song kinda grating. I do respect that she seemed to gain back a lot of old fans from it but it's so boring imo.

**frogaranaman** (0): ah yes, the sound of white Christian fall weddings

All I have to say is that if you are not Black, it would be wise to just not say anything regarding race if you think people are gonna get pissed. Yes, Lizzo’s Music is louder than all of the other albums but let’s not pretend this sub doesn’t have a race problem. I’m not saying disliking Lizzo makes you a racist, but you should explore *why* you don’t like Lizzo. You may hold biases you didn’t even know you held.

**1998tweety** (10): Stop giving a song 1s cause the original is better. Yeah the remix is a step-down but it's still good.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): better than the original YAS!

**rhyneston3** (10): Lmao this is a hot take but this is better than the original one

**wardrum5** (9.4): crazy that I'm the only person to give this over a 9, but this is the superior version of the song. Shawn gives it the boost it needed.

**mms82** (9.2): not the best mixing but this song works so much better as a duet

**patcheso8** (8.5): this works as a duet but I don't like the choice of Shawn on the track

**moooo566** (8): what is even the purpose of this remix (its money)

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Shawn doesn’t add any thing to the song, but his presence doesn’t really hurt it as bad as some of you think. I like that they changed some of the lyrics to make it at least a little different than the original

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): fuck you popheads this is just as good as the original

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): yeah this remix is bleh and doesn’t do anything

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): This isn't as terrible as everyone acts like it is. But yeah I agree they should have filtered his vocals in the same style as Taylor. It's kind of weird they didn't. I do like that he actually wrote new lyrics. Hate when they bring in a new artist for a remix and they just sing the old lyrics.

**dreamingoutloud92** (7): Minus 3 points for Shawn Mendes.

**FluffyNobody** (7): It got points for the changed intro (so dreamy and christmassy) but for the rest, Shawn ruins the song

**jayjaysortagay** (7): he fits in nicely but there's a kinda desperation around this cause the label was pushing it sooo hard.

**ManofOranges** (7): I don't quite understand the idea behind this remix. Like at all. Who requested a version with Shawn Mendes on it??? I do not understand. It's kinda pointless. I don't think Shawn ruins the song but he doesn't elevate it either. In my opinion he's a non-entity. So I'm just giving this the same score as the regular version.

**materialqirl** (7): what in the white-

**muchopartymuchomoney** (7): all the remixes here are useless but Shawn Mendes is the least damaging additional feature of them all

**Mazike** (6.9): made a perfect song so much worse

**rickikardashian** (6.8): shawn does not have a way with words to insert himself into this song

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6.4): Purely sonically, it’s actually good; the holiday twist is cute & Shawn has a lovely smooth voice. But lyrically it aggressively cheapens a song that was perfect and timeless the way it was

**avenueroy** (6.2): Same problem as the version of Perfect with Beyonce, there is no chemistry between Shawn and Taylor. I love his music, love his voice, but him being there takes away from the song and actively makes it weaker.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): She really had the lyrics change in the second verse and bridge but she left the Christmas lights in January line untouched huh

**Agusarg** (6): Is it a lot worse than the original? Yes, but the main appeal is still there

**ceebs\_** (6): shawn mendes adds nothin'

**gannade** (6): this is better than the og

**ggodisawomann** (6): I like this more than everyone else I think skdskfsdk

**leviswift13** (6): shawn no one wanted your canadian ass here. go talk to chameleon we don't want you on our titanic!

**nick1372** (6): Shawn trying to be romantic already makes me uncomfortable and then I remember he's talking about Camila Cabello

**Tolk1en** (6): this song didn't need a remix

**abysmalglimmer** (5.9): straight up just worse than the original

**meiscool132** (5.5): Shawn only sounds good with Camila change my mind.

**radiofan15** (5.5): The slight changes to the mix kinda annoys me and Shawn's presence doesn't really do anything to me... also, their harmonizing sounds tragic

**mayolizard** (5): original outsold

**plantp0wer** (5): I don’t like Shawn’s voice

**TiltControls** (5): It's still a good song, despite Shawn's best efforts

**vayyiqra** (5): Sorry popheads I'm Canadian and i met shawn and he said "idk why Popheads keeps thinking I'm gay and want to top them, I'm as straight as an arrow and I just nutted in Camila last night" and then we did a bro-ey high five and laughed and chugged our beers anyway this remix is pointless but isn't every remix

**franch** (4.7): - 9.5 for "Lover", but only the Taylor half of the remix

**fadedblue09** (4.2): Everything was okay until Shawn started ad-libbing.

**Awkward\_King** (4): okay i dont like it but of all the forced remixes (7 rings, bad guy, good as hell) this is by far my favourite, it still sounds unfinished and unnecessarily cheesy, and it cuts part of the bridge which was the best part of the song, but shawn fits the vibe of the song

**ladililn** (4): I like the extra-Christmassy instrumentation, at least.

**LeninaCrowne94** (4): You don’t realise how great Taylor’s lyrics are until you hear them next to Shawn’s

**nooodisaster** (4): honestly this just highlights that taylor really isnt in the same league as the rest of these pop girlies. the difference in lyrical quality... eek.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): Shawn's voice feels REALLY at odds with Taylor's

**runaway3212** (4): Shawn Mendes has good songs, but he really adds nothing to this song

**static\_int\_husp** (4): completely unneccesary

**twat\_brained** (4): Shawn… I **like** you. Please don't so this

**axestogrind** (3): The way Shawn and Justin teamed up to ruin two of the best songs in this rate with an unnecessary remix... their power

**bandnitos** (3): don't make me get the spray bottle mr mendes

**Brendon-Urine** (3): this song was meh to begin with. no thanks

**hockey\_newfoundland** (3): Bland remix.

**ReallyCreative** (3): the mixing on Shawn's vocals... Shawn's "harmony" on the chorus... his part in the bridge... I just don't see why this needed to happen

**redgold51** (3): Shawn’s cringy Titanic lyric has haunted me forever

**alwayswords** (2): I have information that could lead to the arrest of Shawn Mendes.

**CritneySpearz** (2): wut is dis hunny..

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (2): I really like the remixed intro but eh. What's frustrating is that Shawn's contribution feels so lazy. Shawn's vocals don't even sync to the echo-y feel of Taylor's vocals. So fucking lazy. The fact that Taylor unironically called this as a "COLLABARSHAWN" is uh........Taylor, I love you ghorl and your puns but this ain't it.

**eeveefan01** (2): Who asked for this?

**lapascalia** (2): Why did this happen?

**Mysario** (2): I love the original, but on principle I have to score this so low because it feels like he recorded this on his phone in his tour bus because his manager told him to so they could try and compete with the titans that were Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish's remixes but he didn't know what to write so he wrote the cheesiest dumbest lines ever and then tries to upstage Taylor but we all see through you, Shawn Mendes

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): NO.

**Nickl00** (2): they really couldn’t try any harder?

**NotWith10000Men** (2): did i fucking stutter?

**waluigiest** (2): from the start it’s worse. Why did they add that annoying plucking. Shawn’s verse sucks and what he did to the bridge is unforgivable

**PointlessBibliophage** (1.5): no

**AnimationJava** (1): I didn't really like the original version of Lover and Shawn adds nothing to it.

**bbfan132** (1): this is beyond awful, shawn made the song ten times worse

**bespectacIed** (1): ruined an amazing song with an awfully sung, half-assed guest verse that didn't even help the song in the charts. This is so tragic.

**CarlieScion** (1): no.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): are you SURE I can't give bonus rate songs my 0

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Pass.

**frogaranaman** (1): compulsory heterosexuality if it was a song

**JunkyGS** (1): Shut the fuck up Shawn Mendes. Get your wonder bread mayonnaise infected ass vocals away from this master piece.

**pearllouise** (1): Shawn is me in every group project

**puberty1** (1): this is the first time im listening to this because I didn't cared about it on release and yeah good thing I didn't

**RosaPalms** (1): I will never forgive Taylor for putting a feature on "Lover" and not on "The Man"

**sandyfishnets** (1): meh

**skargardin** (1): sh*wns inclusion really made me absolute hate this song instead of loving it

**slazenger7** (1): Shawn made a great song into something wildly mediocre. Like what the fuck is the Titanic reference about? God it's awful.

**vhqv1997** (1): I'm not saying that Shawn bribed somebody to be able to appear on this remix but I'm not saying this happened because Taylor thought he would fit on the song either

**wavingwolves** (1): i wonder if anyone actually likes this

TBH I’ve been a massive supporter of Lizzo’s positivity but I did not expect this to make it top 10. It was another song that balanced between lower half of the top 10 and barely in the top 20, but it ended up re-peaking and hitting the top 10 by the end of the rate. 

This is the sassier, girls night sister of Truth Hurts. It feels like the next step from Truth Hurts. Go out, look *good as hell* and don’t give a shit because sis is fire. I just think it was a bit short in its themes than other Lizzo songs. 

---

**TragicKingdom1** (11): yall better not sabotage this because it doesn't exactly fit the mood of the world right now...it hasn't once failed to lift me up just a bit since i first heard it in 2016 after tr*mp's election

**1998tweety** (10): Big bop, the bridge into the last chorus is great.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): Should have been her number 1.

**bespectacIed** (10): My intro to Lizzo's music thru the Monet vs Kameron lip sync, I'm ashamed. Been a Lizzbian ever since. Still amazing to this day.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This is like, a shot of dopamine.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song really makes me feel good as hell. (GOOD AS HELL!!!!) It's amazing how a song from 2016 finally got success in 2020. Strange times we live in.

**fadedblue09** (10): Hmmm...so apparently this was from her older releases...but damn, I wished more songs on the album were like this. It's not as overproduced and it shows off her voice well. Maybe I'll like her older stuff better?

**george\_kaito** (10): banger

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I found this song on YouTube a bit after it came out and listened to the whole *Coconut Oil EP*, and then rode my bike to school and plugged my headphones into my friend’s ear and played it for her and watched her jaw drop. “Who is this goddess?” she asked me. And that goddess… was Lizzo.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song makes me want to break up with my non existent man

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A FUCKING MOMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**JMez2613** (10): this song would be my eleven, but I think I love Soulmate a little bit more. It's such a feel-good anthem

**kappyko** (10): Good as Hell

**Kromorei** (10): OPRAHGIF

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is good as hell.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): might as well be the best positivity anthem ever made

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Queen of spreading positivity.

**pearllouise** (10): If you have stanned this song since Monet v. Kameron on Drag Race you deserve a senior discount

**runaway3212** (10): Me having heard this song in 2017 is going to be my only personality trait for the rest of my life.

**skargardin** (10): come thru self loving anthem

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): original is still better than the remix thank u

**Tedyonce** (10): it finally became the hit it was meant to be

**untutorable** (10): this song..... it really always lifts my mood

**wasian-invasion** (10): thanks lizzo i do feel good as hell now

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): timeless

**ladywolvs** (9.9): for variety

**puberty1** (9.5): this song is just the correct way to do commercial pop ugh i honestly have heard a thousand times in the radio but i can't get tired of it

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): What Shake It Off tried to be

**Mysario** (9.3): I heard this chorus for months because it was in some commercial and I'd hear the commercial like a dozen times a day. JC Penny? Marshal's? Lil Caesar's? I have no idea. I miss life. But I also have Animal Crossing now. Praise be to Ankha!

**cleen\_claire** (9): I'm so glad this blew up too

**ggodisawomann** (9): BOPBOP

**hadea0090** (9): this album is

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): I’m glad Lizzo is happy it makes me happy

**jayjaysortagay** (9): Monet X Change was robbed but now she's unbothered with a crown, so 9

**meiscool132** (9): the ultimate feel good anthem for sure

**Nickl00** (9): what got me and many others into her, it’s my favorite positivity song

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This song is good as hell

**vhqv1997** (9): God I hate the fact that this song used trumpets cause I am never not a sucker for those horns. At least this song sounded way smoother than all her other empowerment songs

**waluigiest** (9): this was what propelled her to being a college campus staple I love her so much!!!

**slazenger7** (8.8): Feels like there are three or four versions of this same idea on this album. This is the best expression of it.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.5): Yayyy One of the highlights of the album. Glad she made it a single

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): When I first heard this song, I was shocked that it hadn't been a #1 hit for multiple weeks. It shoulda been a home run, glad the GP finally caught on

**radiofan15** (8.2): Another unexplained belated hit for Lizzo... and even if it was almost as overplayed as Truth Hurts, that doesn't take away from how much of a BOP this is

**twat\_brained** (8.2): So seeing both videos for this song, I enjoy both but the SU one to me is just so much more fun to me.

**bandnitos** (8): i needed this

**Kanne\_** (8): i didnt remember liking this album this much and it's incredible how high each score was

**leviswift13** (8): i always think i don't like it, but when i listen to i do like it. i do i do ido

**nick1372** (8): It's honestly not easy to make an empowerment song that is this easily accessible but still authentic

**rhyneston3** (8): My mom loves this song, this is for you mom

**SFbby** (8): Something about the instrumentals always makes this song sounds a little sad to me

**vayyiqra** (8): woke

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song should not be on this album or in this rate. But I do like it.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): the only Lizzo song I knew before 2019

**alwayswords** (7): this commercial classic

**cremeebrulee** (7): eh never a huge fan of this song

**FluffyNobody** (7): I love the trumpets and that's about it, but at least this is a song I can think of listening, so it gets an extra point for that

**nooodisaster** (7): Monet leaving the runway during this lipsync is still iconic

**Stryxen** (6.3): ...why do I have nothing to say

**Johnnytoby** (6): literally made for commercials

**mayolizard** (6): ariana version outsold

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): so beyond tired of this one

**AnimationJava** (5): This song sounds like it was MADE for makeup/beauty product commercials.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like a fake pop song that would be written for a teen romcom

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): this song annoys the fuck out of me

**Awkward\_King** (3): i don't dislike it and it's nothing against the song it's just never really done anything for me

**Brendon-Urine** (0): GOD this song is annoying. no thank you.

**Jimmy345960** (0): So sad that this is my zero. I wouldve given it a four but its my lowest score. Every single song on these albums is legenedary and all these ladies are wonderful. I could never get into this song. It dosent make sense because i love songs that are upbeat and positive but it doesnt do it for me. Sorry.......

This was REALLY slow on first listen, but this is now one of my favorite songs from her ever. It’s such a fun beat (I know fun really isn’t the word to describe this, but it really isn’t a good way to describe most of Billie’s stuff). 

It’s driving, haunting lyrics, and it comes at a point where her era needed an extra push and it fits her album so well that it felt like a seamless extension.

---

**Stryxen** (11): how can she do this to me. she plays towards her strengths sounding simultaneously indifferent and terrified and the lyrics are wow. I can’t listen to this too often because I’ll need a lie down. everyth1ng 1 wanted

**anagalisgv** (10): my favorite sad bop

**Austine567** (10): perfect billie song

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song was kind of meh to me on release but it really clicks now, idk what changed

**bandnitos** (10): a muted dance pop song. we love that

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): Without a doubt her best song. It was the first song I heard by her and got me really excited to listen to her. Gotta say she didn't live up to the hype. At least there's always this song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This was in the run for my 11, and to me, proves that everything we just heard isn't a fluke. Sleeper hit of year.

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh i didn’t know this was on the album. regardless, this is an excellent song and i am really glad it’s doing well on the charts!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is such a beautiful song about suicidal thoughts and getting through it. I really felt Billie's pain here. Damn.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): one of my favorite songs from her, I love the vibes and the production and I hope she makes more songs like this <3

**FluffyNobody** (10): Completely unrelated rant, a few weeks my boyfriend comes to me and he's like "Do you know this Billie Eilish? This song is really good". I knew her and the song already, of course, but since we usually don't listen to the same music, I almost never talk to him about it. I found it cute that we can like the same songs sometimes.

**hadea0090** (10): crine

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is one of my rare in my feelings songs. I love how Finneas comes in on the chorus like he talking to Billie and I think this is another heartbreaking but beautifully haunting song. One of my favourites for sure

**jayjaysortagay** (10): ughhh the message of this is wonderful. Stan Billie. Stan Finneas.

**mayolizard** (10): don't know why this was put into the album section but serve yas

**meiscool132** (10): one of Billie's and Finneas's best imo. also recommend listening to this in the car with your friends at night with the bass turned wayyy up for an experience™

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this song is everything i wanted

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Another mastery of atmosphere. chef’s kiss

**radiofan15** (10): I didn't... but I'm not mad at all...

**redgold51** (10): Best Billie song and best sad dance pop song ever

**strangergravityfalls** (10): look the relationship between finneas and billie is cute idk them driving to their death in the ocean is cute, i will not be reading any further into it, anyone calling finneas predatory because of his relationship with billie needs to get a life

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/622/366/7d1.jpg

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): not sure why this is here (probably explained in the post but i can’t look at that rn) but it’s an easy 10

**twat\_brained** (10): This is the Generation Z "Ribs" but you're not ready for that conversation yet. the video is me on GTA V online

**waluigiest** (10): I definitely dont consider this to be in the universe of the album but WOW what a song

**wavingwolves** (10): perfect

**AnimationJava** (9.5): A very haunting song about the downsides of fame, Billie once again illustrates her unique view on life.

**materialqirl** (9.5): got me through a really tough time

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9.5): introspective, real, devastating, authentic. billie said fuck your "teen girls are faking depression" mentality

**Mysario** (9.1): i actually love this song but I'm shaving off points for the sole reason that it's part of a reissue and not part of the original release REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

**akanewasright** (9): This song shouldn’t be tagged on the end of this album, but I love it anyway, so I’m glad we’re rating it.

**Anthony-Vince** (9): Wasn't a big fan at first, but now I think it's a really beautiful song

**axestogrind** (9): If Billie and Finneas had taste they'd lean into this smooth groovy lo-fi beat type energy in the next album

**hikkaru** (9): i hope she does more like this in the future

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): Issa vibe

**Kromorei** (9): this song made me cry.

**ReallyCreative** (9): give me an entire album of this please

**rhyneston3** (9): Dark song, but I love her voice in it

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I would love to see her do more with this sound.

**skargardin** (9): I'm slightly confused as to why this is in the main rate bc afaik it isnt on any version of the album

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (9): easily my fave billie song, great tune

**Tolk1en** (9): This song is the ultimate proof that Billie is incredibly talented

**fadedblue09** (8.3): I love the beats and her voice here! Though I'm not sure why this was included though.

**wardrum5** (8.2): she sounds extra quiet on this one but I still like it

**1998tweety** (8): It's cute, better than most of the album. Still kind of overrated though.

**cleen\_claire** (8): i'm sad

**george\_kaito** (8): just a lil boring but the lyrics are so hauntingly beautiful

**J\_Toe** (8): I didn't realise the cover art was the Golden Gate Bridge, or get the references to it as just 'stepping off the golden' till I read genius :(

**leviswift13** (8): the only song of hers that seems to get better with each listen.

**ManofOranges** (8): I honestly can't believe that this song has charted pretty high and for a decent amount of time. Probably just because I couldn't imagine anyone listening to this on the radio or something and being like "oh yes turn it UP" like I would probably switch the station or change the channel. Ignoring that, the song itself is pretty good I think. It doesn't quite have everything I wanted though.

**nick1372** (8): how is this so quiet but goes SO hard

**Nickl00** (8): this honestly isn’t super memorable but I love it every time it comes on

**puberty1** (8): basically a b-side song but nice enough

**runaway3212** (8): Not her best song, but still very solid

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): Seems like she was more concerned with exorcising her feelings than making an unique song. This is good, but very on brand for her.

**wasian-invasion** (8): oh this isnt on the bonus rate? But it wasn’t on the album…

deleted: **E3-NotTheConvention** (7.9): Love the chill beat, it would've been great if it would build up to something more powerful.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): Not a Billie fan but I'm surprised that I actually kinda like this?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I remember seeing the single art for this song popping up on everybody’s 5x5s after it came out and I was like “who is that” but now that I’m finally listening to it it’s nice. There’s some really nice moments but also some really boring ones (like the second verse) that drag the song down. Maybe it’s just that I’m from a somewhat dysfunctional family but like… stop holding hands with your brother girl. Not to shame but like…

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): great song, beautiful lyrics, I've just heard it a zillion times now

**untutorable** (7.5): i'm very close with my sister so this one hits tbh

**WeastofEden44** (7.5): I'm glad to see some growth from Billie but this song does feel a bit non-essential

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): maybe a bit too chill but decent

**kappyko** (7): eh

**vayyiqra** (7): I've never heard this before but it's really nice

**bespectacIed** (6): bop

**franch** (6): again this seems to go on too long

**nooodisaster** (6): Pretty standard Billie at this point.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): did anything happen in this song

**ggodisawomann** (4): meh

**pearllouise** (4): when Billie said "ehiehiiieheiiiieheiiiiiieeeiii" I felt that

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: > DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy (10): This is such a beautiful song about suicidal thoughts and getting through it. I really felt Billie's pain here. Damn.

TW: suicide

I gave "listen before i go" a low score for its similar theme so I just want to clarify my comment. "everything i wanted" tackles more on thoughts, rather than the action. I find that song that tackles on suicidal thoughts more relatable than a song where the character actually attempts to commit suicide and it highly disturbs me, hence the low score for that song for personal reasons. Both songs are beautiful on their own way but "everything I wanted" is much easier to listen.

---

So amazingly written, she’s so great at getting basic concepts to sound like absolute pure gold. 

This reminds me of Here by Alessia Cara but more depressed but also with better staying power. 

---

**bandnitos** (11): this is such a basic 11 but fuck it's just so beautiful

**ComeOnPupperfish** (11): I throw this around a lot, but this is the quintessential perfect minimalist pop song, because it isn't minimalistic as in a lack of elements. But this is a song that knows who the main characters are (the lyricism and Billie's voice) and does the most that it can to put them in the best light possible. This is the song I always use as an example of how Billie is the best new artist we've gotten in the past 5 years.

**Evanbrooks324** (11): , easily my favorite off the album and the whole rate, everything about it is Billie and it's an amazing song

**frogaranaman** (11): haunting

**hockey\_newfoundland** (11): Just an amazing song

**hunnybee12** (11): the atmosphere in this song is unmatched… even with the modern, minimalist production it feels timeless. a modern classic tbh

**Kanne\_** (11): yes im basic no i don't care

**plantp0wer** (11): Billie is at her best with songs like this I think

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): very few songs hold the power to make me miserable like this one. but there’s also something about its replay value that makes me think it’s going to be a song that’s listened to for years and years to come.

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (11): if billie is the next lorde, this is her ribs moment

**1998tweety** (10): Okay she actually made a big point here. This is this style of song done well, it's a ballad but still has Billie's unique spin on it. Perfect.

**agentofscranton** (10): billificent's ballads are kinda everything. the fragility in her voice, coupled with the production, and those lyrics oh my god. it's just a quality pop ballad.

**Agusarg** (10): What a stunning song. The harmonies are so good

**akanewasright** (10): This song is just too damn gorgeous.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Beautiful track. Not the kind I usually listen to but there's something about this song that just pulls you in.

**CarlieScion** (10): gorgeous, show stopping, never the same, iconic etc

**cleen\_claire** (10): i'm speechless, what can i even say about this masterpiece

**FluffyNobody** (10): This song fucking breaks my heart and then plays with the pieces

**george\_kaito** (10): such a beautiful song. her vocals popped off too

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is absolutely gorgeous and I will come for anyone just writes this is off as boring or lame.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): jesus christ this song fucking hits

**jayjaysortagay** (10): idk if I can honestly rate this, it has the best music video I've ever seen and I can't separate that from the song. Love the vocals.

**kappyko** (10): yes

**leviswift13** (10): one of her best songs. really beautiful and vulnerable and just dreamy.

**mayolizard** (10): omg smash classic

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): i love ballads with subtly quirky production elements, so this song is just meant for me

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Billie Eilish has mastered the art of silence and subtlety as instruments themselves. Her voice is a deep well of emotion and the production fits her immaculately.

**pearllouise** (10): In all seriousness, this is my favorite Billie Eilish song because it is so raw especially considering she wrote and recorded it at such a young age. It's just an amazing song.

**puberty1** (10): i guess the zoomers made some points...

**radiofan15** (10): love the minimalistic atmosphere and her vocals on this one... it is appropriately haunting yet catchy enough to really stand out even among several songs of her that sound alike

**rhyneston3** (10): This is how you do a ballad but keep it interesting! Love this

**rsmitty99** (10): Beuatiful. All I can say

**runaway3212** (10): This song really captures a certain mood

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The best way to listen to this song is at night with all the lights off, looking out a window while it snows. The song is so pretty and it has my favorite lyrics from the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is really one of those once in a lifetime songs huh

**Tedyonce** (10): i'll never get over "bad guy" killing this at radio, it had SUCH GOOD

**TragicKingdom1** (10): billie's best song because it shows off the depth of her songwriting and emotion. it's by no means a traditional ballad but reels in the listener irregardless

**twat\_brained** (10): I've lost count of how many times I've seen the video just because I love how the ink just pours down Billie's face. It completely inspired my Halloween 2018 costume

**wasian-invasion** (10): this is what I play at night when i want to feel all my emotions

**wavingwolves** (10): this encapsulates the feeling of coming down after a party so perfectly, it's pretty masterful

**xosam** (10): This is the first song I ever heard by Billie and its still my favourite of hers

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.8): Mimimalistic masterpiece. And the video elevates it even more.

**Kromorei** (9.5): one of her best songs

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): her voice is so soft and beautiful

**slazenger7** (9.5): Best song on this album by far. She's much better with complex vocal harmonies than overwrought digital production.

**anothertown** (9): why is this the best ballad of recent years… CALL ME BACK

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Used to skip this a lot of the time, but now I've learned to appreciate it. "I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that" is ethereal.

**hadea0090** (9): this song ends too soon

**meiscool132** (9): just great

**nooodisaster** (9): we are CRYING!!

**skargardin** (9): ethereal

**waluigiest** (9): CALL ME BACK

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): lovely voice

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This music video was SUCH a moment, it was actually my first exposure to her and I was like “wtf is this.” It’s such a simple visual but instantly memorable. The song didn’t capture me back then though and while I’m still not super into it I can’t deny it’s an intimate, beautiful track. But also stop consuming activated charcoal, it’s a scam.

**vayyiqra** (8): :pensive:

**WeastofEden44** (8): Really nice but this got so overplayed lol

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.8): A very pretty song, just a little too vanilla for me.

**alwayswords** (7): :icannotsee:

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Guessing this is considered the 'ballad' of the album... a little weird to say when the whole album is pretty downbeat and emo already. It is pretty though.

**Johnnytoby** (7): you know the first time I heard this I didnt understand it but it's so raw

**mms82** (7): boring but beautiful

**nick1372** (7): the incredible use of silence in this song makes it actually hard to listen to

**Nickl00** (7): I wish it wasn’t that slow, but still pretty good

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's fine but it doesn't stand out to me

**Stryxen** (7): guessing popheads balladphobia is gonna hit this hard

**untutorable** (7): bit of a spooky one

**vhqv1997** (7): I once saw a dude on Tinder who said this song was the best song ever written and I had to swipe left despite the fact he was kinda cute.

deleted: **Mysario** (6.6): Billie, why are you at parties? you're underage! I'm calling the popo 5-0

**ManofOranges** (6): I mean this song exists I guess. It feels like it's just yet another sad girl type song with minimal instrumentation for extra sad oomph, but that doesn't really justify its existence in my mind. Anyways, the part where she says "and I could lie, say I like it like that" never ceases to remind of I Like It and sheer contrast between this song and the song that it reminds me of always makes me laugh.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6): song's not for me but i think Billie's voice really shines in this

**Tolk1en** (5): so boring I fell asleep

**bespectacIed** (4): zzz

**fadedblue09** (4): I appreciate her attempt at a ballad, but think you'll only like this if you love her voice.

**franch** (4): zzzz

**ggodisawomann** (4): not bad, but not my taste

**AnimationJava** (2): When this song first came out, I was turned off from Billie for a while because it didn't fit my tastes at all.

throwback when Taylor started talking about her masters, and we all had to become experts on the subject in a few hours just to be able to discuss it

---

#the two serious comments we got

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): Taylor's frustration with Scott and Scotter is part of a wider problem in the music industry where artists don't get to own the art they created. Among all of the things Taylor was outspoken for, this is my favorite one yet. This is the one that is truly close to her heart as an artist and I am with Taylor every second of the way. I wrote a thinkpiece on why Taylor should fight for her artistry from Big Machine for my student paper and I hope my editors like it enough for it to be published.

**slazenger7** (10): This is actual legitimate news and could potentially impact U.S. copyright law if things continue down this path, so this has got to be the highest-rated "controversy."

#stan twitter

**puberty1** (11): i mean she really snapped

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): Messy and dramatic and yet Taylor pretty much comes out on top in every single round. I wonder how long it will take until Scooter is tired of being the Swifties' punching bag?

**bespectacIed** (10): Fuck scooter

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): our song

**E3-NotTheConvention** (10): it was inescapable

**fadedblue09** (10): Team Taylor on this obviously.

**glencocoisrealmate** (10): cause I learned so much from that hell

**jimmy345960** (10): This ones ok

**leviswift13** (10): give. her. back. her. masters.

**Nivster** (10): Taking down the man yeah!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): stream the man

**radiofan15** (10): GO OF QUEEN...

**runaway3212** (10): honestly drama that keeps on giving. I feel bad for her and I will defend her forever, but it’s also pretty entertaining.

**tedyonce** (10): she gave us everything we wanted this year drama-wise

**Tolk1en** (10): I absolutely enjoyed everything about it. Read all the news, spent hours and hours on social medias. Overdose of tea

**TragicKingdom1** (10): we love a controversy that's brought up in my music industry class every other week

**vhqv1997** (10): Okay this controversy actually mattered and not just pointless drama between bored rich people.

**WeastofEden44** (10): Some Mimi Imfurst vs. Everyone level shit lmaooo

**lilacsweetener** (9): don’t know about controversial since she’s far from the first to encounter this issue but certainly a headline grabber and point of interest. How far does her power truly extend and can she eventually reclaim her work? Tune in next time on The Swift Life.

**Agusarg** (8): It was pretty entertaining and helped showcase how shitty the music industry can be

**hadea0090** (8): the scooter memes were funny and she did what she had to do

**ImAMessyBitchDuh** (8): ok taylor was robbed with this one

**meiscool132** (8): regardless of who's right, it's a big oof

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): I still have no idea how this is even legal like what the fuck

**anothertown** (5): girl don't you get it, nothing matters.

**1998tweety** (1): i hate this awful awful men

---

**ManofOranges** (9): I like the majority of 2 Chainz's verse so it's overall not really a downgrade from the original.

**fadedblue09** (8): Doesn't really improve the song but doesn't ruin it either? Don't get the hate tbh.

**ggodisawomann** (8): I really like this! original did outsell tho

**rhyneston3** (8): Does my taste in music suck cause I am actually rating this higher than the original

**cremeebrulee** (7): this was a thing wtf lmao??

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7): nope

**meiscool132** (7): a downgrade but still fun

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Good PR move on her part, kinda wish the 2 Chainz verse was better.

**Mysario** (6.9): his addition is not that good and really ruins the flow of the song but his delivery of some of these lines are so goofy that I just have to stan. the entire first four bars are silly as well as "and I'm well respected so she feel protected". [good luck with that respect!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h81HESbEmI)

**materialqirl** (6.5): uhm..what was the reason to ruin a great song with a collab

**shesdoingyoga** (6.5): I don’t like the effect on 2 Chainz’s voice and I don’t like his verse either

**ceebs\_** (6): i forgot about this

**cleen\_claire** (6): i don't know how to feel

**mayolizard** (6): anyways wheres the nicki remix

**PointlessBibliophage** (6): i'm sorry was this supposed to improve the song i didn't realize

**wardrum5** (6): 2 Chainz wrote his verse on his way to the studio and it shows. Wish this was better because he has some great features and she totally stole his aesthetic, but it's nowhere near as good as the original

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): 2 Chainz clearly wrote this verse in like 2 minutes or less but please stream Pretty Girls Like Trap Music anyway

**AnimationJava** (5): As much as I love the original, 2 Chainz did nothing for me on this.

**avenueroy** (5): Definitely better than the original but still not great

**bandnitos** (5): the original's better

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (5): Let's not.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): two Chainz dragged this down

**Kromorei** (5): why does this exist

**nick1372** (5): the song wasn't good to begin with but this doesn't make it better or wose

**pearllouise** (5): Thank you Ariana for reminding me that 2 Chainz is still alive

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): The feature is too slow and disrupts the song, I don’t like it

**WeastofEden44** (5): This song if the epitome of useless remixes

**puberty1** (4): i actually like 2 Chainz here but the feature is just so shoehorned

**Tolk1en** (4): A disaster 2 Chainz destroyed the song. Ariana please keep singing alone

**franch** (3.5): why did this happen

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (3): UMMMM.....AND WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPRESSED BY 2CHAINZ'S VERSE? LMAOOOOOO.

**Johnnytoby** (3): uhneccessary

**LeninaCrowne94** (3): He killed this song

**leviswift13** (3): does this sound familiar to you? cuz it sounds really fameeleeyar to me

**Nickl00** (3): usually a remix doesn’t ruin a song this much but I can’t stand this

**RosaPalms** (3): "Rule the World" is a fucking 10 though

**runaway3212** (3): This song is just a drag.

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): a mediocre song with a mediocre rap added, 2 Chainz could not give less energy there lmao

**berober04** (2): Chainz

**bespectacIed** (2): This is awful, 2 Chainz sounds like Google Translate

**CarlieScion** (2): I will respect this

**skargardin** (2): k bye

**vhqv1997** (2): Ariana was the better rapper on this song

**1998tweety** (1): Not good lmao.

**Awkward\_King** (1): im glad she got him on the track but like, that's all im glad about. this is not a good verse

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): are you SURE I can't give bonus rate songs my 0

**dreamingoutloud92** (1): I didn’t think anything could be worse than the original but here we are.

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): The sampled verses were the only good part, why take one out?

**hadea0090** (1): still bad

**hockey\_newfoundland** (1): Didn't like 7 Rings to begin with and I already used a 0 on it so I guess this gets an 1

**ImADudeDuh** (1): we love a song made to get fans to shut the fuck up

**jayjaysortagay** (1): absolutely not, why does this exist. I had never heard this before and I hate that you brought it to my attention. I want to give it a -10.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (1): Since I already gave OG 7 rings a 0, can I give this a negative 1?

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): the original is already trash but holy shit 2 Chainz makes it unbelievably worse

**nooodisaster** (1): me at 3am: 2 chainz has to be a parody persona, 2 chainz has to be a parody persona, 2 chainz has-

**radiofan15** (1): I never thought this turd of a song could get any worse but lo and behold... Ariana and Titty Boy found a way!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): a terrible song made even worse by a completely unfitting phoned in feature!

**TiltControls** (1): not much you can do to improve the song

**vayyiqra** (1): please no this song is unbearable enough without a stupid shitty remix and he just sounds bored this is an abomination

**waluigiest** (1): bruh you took a bad appropriative song and made it so much worse how??? MESS

**wavingwolves** (1): i had no idea this existed and i hate it

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I just want to apologize for my comments regarding the "Lizzo is loud" argument. I admit that it does come off too sensitive and preachy, especially in a Popheads rate where it's supposed to be fun and light-hearted (other than the trashtalking).

My main frustration was that I never see Lizzo being commented as "loud" often compared to her other peers. Perhaps for a song like the titular song of the album, it's intended to be loud with its production and her vocals compliment it well.

I am apologizing because as a non-black POC, this is probably not the discourse to participate but listen instead.

I will end this comment by saying that while we should have fun, we definitely need to assess our own biases and listen to criticism. As /u/nerdy_boy_chris said perfectly, we may hold biases we don't even know we had.

**mms82** (9.9): I really actually like the remix, it's not as good as the og but this song would have 100s of plays by me if it was the only version

**wardrum5** (9.5): I wish JB's lyrics actually fit the song, but I love his part

**ggodisawomann** (9): I really like this! I know people think Justin's piece in it is awful but lowkey it bops idc idc

**Mysario** (8.2): as far as celebrity tacked on remixes go, JBiebs does a good job staying relevant

**dreamingoutloud92** (8): Minus 2 points for Justin Bieber.

**alwayswords** (7): dare i say overhated

**puberty1** (7): yes i also hate myself for actually liking it

**TragicKingdom1** (7): bieber does not ruin this as much as people say he does

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): i don’t love this song, but i love that it exists as a concept. like the fact that billie put this out to try to beat out OTR and LNX just put out ANOTHER remix. that shit was so funny. not to mention this cover is incredible.

**materialqirl** (6.5): you did this for what..

**franch** (6): why do all these remixes just make it worse

**Tolk1en** (6): an amazing song before 1'13 and afer 2'01.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.7): Up until the horrific adlibs at the end, I was willing to accept it, since Justin’s voice is nice and I like how he twisted the melody a bit

**abysmalglimmer** (5): well at least she got the #1

**bandnitos** (5): why did he have to show up

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (5): Bieber brings this WAY down... God how many times has that been said?

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I’m scoring this a 10 for Billie and a zero for Justin so it averages to a 5

**rhyneston3** (5): I love the Biebs, but this was a bad choice

**shesdoingyoga** (5): The cover art has more emotion than Justin’s part. I’m glad Billie got the chance to work with someone she was a fan of but that doesn’t mean it had to be released to the public. At least the changes to the melody that Justin does are mildly interesting

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): i’m sorry billie but what was this

**vayyiqra** (5): what remix this doesn't exist there has been an error so I must give it a perfectly average score how can one rate it if it doesn't exist

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Bieber surprisingly blends in with her style but no one should be wasting time on this.

**anagalisgv** (4): this remix somehow managed to massacre a fantastic song

**FluffyNobody** (4): who thought this was a good idea

**meiscool132** (4): I get that it was a dream for Billie and all but... why, just why

**moooo566** (4): honestly what a way to kill a good song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): God fuck you Justin

**strangergravityfalls** (4): what if the real treasure bad guy was the friends we made along the way justin bieber

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.6): I’m glad she had her fun.

**slazenger7** (3.5): Like Shawn, he makes a good tune godawful.

**AnimationJava** (3): Like much of popheads, I don't really think Bieber adds much to the osng.

**LeninaCrowne94** (3): Yes, he definitely is a “bad guy”

**ManofOranges** (3): Justin's verse is awful. I hate it. End of subject!

**nootnoot781** (3): just as ajay said, "he actually, successfully, made it sound worse"

**TiltControls** (3): leaving the JB's sections blank would have been better than this

**wasian-invasion** (3): ew ruined

**CritneySpearz** (2): ruined..

**E3-NotTheConvention** (2): it just doesn't work, it gives the exact opposite vibe

**jayjaysortagay** (2): NO. stop putting flop men on my pop girl songs.

**Johnnytoby** (2): ew

**Kanne\_** (2): why tho

**Kromorei** (2): i hate justin bieber

**leviswift13** (2): no thank u next

**nick1372** (2): Justin Bieber is an empty void of personality

**Nickl00** (2): like the lover remix, they coulda tried a little harder

**static\_int\_husp** (2): Absolutely not

**axestogrind** (1.5): The 0.5 is for the single cover art

**radiofan15** (1.1): At least the artwork is nice

**1998tweety** (1): Trash

**Awkward\_King** (1): im starting this song right now and im honestly dreading listening to it oh no justin just did the yeah yeah thing STOP IT STOP this song is fucking terrible it makes sense that billie would agree to it because she loves justin so much but wow he does not fit the vibe of this song at all and completely misses the point in all the lyrics, its a fucking fat no

**bbfan132** (1): trash trash trash

**bespectacIed** (1): worst song in existence

**Brendon-Urine** (1): nope nope nope nope nope nope nope

**CarlieScion** (1): WHYYYYYYYY

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): are you SURE I can't give bonus rate songs my 0

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (1): If I can give this remix a 0, I would. Like Justin’s lyrics don’t even make sense. The ab-libs are hella corny too. And what was he burping as an ad-lib? Fucking disgusting The best part of the remix was the cover art.

**frogaranaman** (1): I'm impressed that Justin Bieber was able to remove a 0 from this song's score.

**hockey\_newfoundland** (1): A remix that ruined a perfectly great song

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i fucking hate scooter braun and billie’s justin standom

**jackisboredtoday** (1): I still don’t know what Justin means by saying “it’s not political” on this song…. was anyone thinking it was? were people annoyed thinking it was?? why say that?

**Jimmy345960** (1): ruins the fucking song

**JunkyGS** (1): GET AWAY FROM HER! GET A JOB!

**kappyko** (1): no

**ladililn** (1): I moved last year, and now this is the only version of the song my local radio station plays, because apparently I moved to HELL.

**lapascalia** (1): Unbelivably bad.

**mayolizard** (1): bad bad bad!

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): until this rate i had completely ignored this remix's existence, and i had never listened to it (except for a tiny snippet from Todd's best of 2019 video). this is so cringe-worthy. complete trash. wtf are those adlibs in the outro. thankfully bad guy didn't get Despacito'd and the Bieber version never got credited on the Hot 100.

**Nivster** (1): I understand she loves him but his verse is unnecessary and takes away from the vibe of the song.

**nooodisaster** (1): bold of you to assume i still wont give this a 0

**NotWith10000Men** (1): fuck it

**pearllouise** (1): Are negative numbers an option for this rate?

**PointlessBibliophage** (1): i'm sorry but has justin bieber ever contributed anything good to a remix

**RandomHypnotica** (1): this is proof that god has abandoned us

**ReallyCreative** (1): horrible lyrics, a mediocre vocal delivery that does not mesh with the original that well, obnoxious, no point, please stop

**rickikardashian** (1): When wailord and I were thinking of what the bonus rate would be, I suggested 5 different Billie songs, and this wasn’t one of those, not because I think it’s one of the worst things to happen to one of the best hit songs we had last decade (which I do), but because I had forgotten about it. I remembered the existence of bitches broken heart, the AB6IX remix of Truth Hurts, the song Taylor sings in Cats, and Ariana’s cover of you Don’t Own Me with Kristin Chenoweth, and I didn’t remember this, and I’m 100% sure it was my brain repressing this remix to protect my mental health.

**rotating3Dtext** (1): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**runaway3212** (1): The worst song ever, would get my 0 if I could give it

**skargardin** (1): jesus fuck NO, I don't care how much you idolize and wanted him on this song Billie, just like Shawn ruins Lover, Bieber DEMOLISHES this song in all the wrong ways

**Stryxen** (1): but imagine how tired we are of it. imagine how tired we are

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): mods can we make an exception just this once and let me give a 0 to a bonus rate song

**Tedyonce** (1): SKRR SKRR

**waluigiest** (1): it’s so much worse. Putting a man on this song was an unforgivable crime

**wavingwolves** (1): a mistake luv

**WeastofEden44** (1): This disgusts me

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): not a day goes by where i don’t question the existence of this version of bad guy

The music video and release of this song was INSANE. The production value of the video and just how strangely creepy it all was got me hooked and I was subsequently obsessed with the roll out of this album. 

The song is also one of the few intentionally upbeat and boppy regardless of the lyrics and message. This is definitely the song I want to hear live from her if I ever get the opportunity you $400 a ticket scalper mother fuckers. 

---

**cashewconstellation** (11): The best song on the album and in the rate, it made me somewhat of a Billie fan.

**agentofscranton** (10): the peak of billucifer's spooky ooky bops.

**alwayswords** (10): the drill sound… who is doing it like her???

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I remember hearing this for the first time, and realizing Billie was up to something awesome.

**cleen\_claire** (10): billie flawlessly pulls off this edgy image

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Name drop that album, sis! Sidenote, I genuinely find the music video for this song extremely eery.

**cremeebrulee** (10): another banger. i love how creepy it is and it definitely fits with the sleep paralysis vibe i think she was going for

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Literally me when Billie sang the album's title

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The only really eerie song on the album. Even the mildest feelings of terror make me dislike things right away, but not this time. This is haunting in the best kind of way.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): was snatched when I first heard it and even more by the music video

**george\_kaito** (10): this is genuinely terrifying

**ggodisawomann** (10): second or third Billie song I ever heard and I love it lol

**hadea0090** (10): This song is kinda all over the place but still extremely catchy and interesting.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): billie.

**Jimmy345960** (10): HOLY FUCK this is good

**JMez2613** (10): this is my favorite Billie song and deserves to be her most popular

**Johnnytoby** (10): love the time signature

**kappyko** (10): yes

**lapascalia** (10): So good! Her personality really shines through here, love it.

**mayolizard** (10): omg this is a classic

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): the whole album has a bizarre flair, but this song is the peak of it. a song as weird and disturbing as this can only either be terrible or fantastic. this is the latter. it's amazing this song charted enough to make the year-end.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This girl is honestly terrifying and she needs to make more horror-pop PLEASE.

**nick1372** (10): honestly this is the song that cemented Billie as an icon for me. I haven't heard a song in years that was this focused on a capturing a very specific vibe and did it SO well. Pop music really is gonna sound like this for the next 5 years.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the music video still fucks me up

**pearllouise** (10): boo

**plastichaxan** (10): so close to being my eleven damn

**radiofan15** (10): Billie

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I still love bad guy, but I really wish this got all the praise it was getting instead, it's just honestly so refreshing, unique and yet familiar.

**rhyneston3** (10): Yes Billie!! I love evil pop

**shesdoingyoga** (10): My favorite part of this one is the sound effects that match the lyrics, like the shovel sound after she says bury a friend

**Stryxen** (10): this is probably the best track on the album. It fits the themes of every other track and takes their sounds to another level

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If Lizzo wasn’t in this rate this wouldve easily been my 11

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this is the song that converted me into a billie fan. i remember watching the video and thinking “wow this is not like anything in pop music right now”.

**twat\_brained** (10): **I WANNA END ME. I BELONG IN HELL.**

**waluigiest** (10): the production the beats the lyrics the vocals.... billie at her best!!!

**wardrum5** (10): her best song and the perfect coronavirus anthem

**wavingwolves** (10): this is how my intrusive thoughts sound like

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): who else could pull this off? literally i want to know

**anothertown** (9.5): you have to face facts that this is iconic

**jackisboredtoday** (9.4): so freaking good and one of the most unique songs on the album even if its influences are clear. one of the only moments on this album that genuinely justifies all the “this is the future” hype around Billie to me

**akanewasright** (9): This was my first Billie song, and it gave a me a fever that I’ll be feeling forever. It’s so damn cool sounding and GOOD! Ugh, it’s not fair how good this song sounds.

**AnimationJava** (9): Everything about this single was amazing! Billie served visuals, a coherent theme, and a well-crafted tune.

**bandnitos** (9): I LOVE TRIPLETS!!! i love triplets

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): talk about ATMOSPHERE

**ignitethephoenix** (9): lots of people say this is headphones kind of album and this song definitely is one that’s better with headphones on than off. Also the bridge here is definitely the best part of the song

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): I don’t know what this song is about but I choose this song to be about dating someone with mental illness because I can see a lot of parallels with this and a prior relationship.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): love the harmonies omg

**Kromorei** (9): amazing except its about XXXTentacion

**meiscool132** (9): I think this is the song that got me into Billie and I'm thankful for it

**Nickl00** (9): deserved to be as big as bad guy

**puberty1** (9): the better billboard top 20 song of her career

**skargardin** (9): While Im not a fan of the direction this album took i can acknowledge that this is a pretty great song, the atmosphere is so haunting. Even so i dont come back to it a whole lot because of that.

**TiltControls** (9): spooky

**untutorable** (9): my fave billie song probably

**vhqv1997** (9): This is what stepping on broken glass in a dark room feels like in audio form

**wasian-invasion** (9): my tongue cries in sympathy everytime

**Mysario** (8.8): the main hook is one of the best from that year but the rest of the song is very decent

**WeastofEden44** (8.6): This is what depression feels like at times

**1998tweety** (8.5): This bops a bit tbh even though some of the lyrics are cringey.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (8.5): A very interesting song structurally, not my absolute favorite to listen to but I respect it

**frogaranaman** (8): I remember watching this music video during its debut in a coffee shop and people leaning over to say "what the fuck is that" 💀

**nooodisaster** (8): Points for being different in this landscape while still being catchy and fun.

**vayyiqra** (8): Now that's what I call EDGY

**runaway3212** (7.5): I love the chorus and I don't really mind the rest.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): dark and kind of interesting.

**leviswift13** (7): a really bold offering. i love the point of view of the monster under her bed. doesn't really stick, but it's super different and experimental and weird.

**ReallyCreative** (7): the vocal effects show a lot of promise but I don't think it takes advantage of them, it's a little hollow

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6.9): Not for me, but I get the fuss about it.

**Anthony-Vince** (6): I liked it at first but it got old quick

**CarlieScion** (6): I love black skinhead by Kanye west

**ManofOranges** (6): This song is also just fine. I don't enjoy it like some of the other songs on the album. Even if this song were sonically enjoyable for me though, I don't know if I could like it to the fullest extent though because some of the lyrics just fully are too like depressing I guess? I don't know if that's the right word but I'm fully taken out of it and am just left wondering if she is okay.

**FluffyNobody** (5): I thought I was gonna give this song a higher rating to be honest, but I listened to it again and... it doesn't work for me?

**fadedblue09** (4.9): Appreciate the grim vibes but too much unnecessary effects, and overall very forgettable. Love the title drop though

**Kanne\_** (4): not as bad as i thought it was

**bespectacIed** (1): I understand we humans all have to experience teenhood, a time where we think everything we do is new and cool and edgy. We eventually learn better and grow out of it. I hope Billie does too, because this song (and her music) is the exemplification of everything cringeworthy about that phase in our life.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Since all the remixes in the bonus rate got dragged hard, I just want to say Megan Thee Stallion's Savage remix with Beyonce should be a standard on how to make a good remix. It provides a significant change to the production with some fire lyrics.

To the team managing our pop girls, if you attempt to do a remix especially for the song to climb on the charts, at least make some effort to make the remix have some replay value.

Nerdy_boy_chris: I said that the only remixes in recent memory that mattered are Old Town Road & Finesse. 

But say what you will about Lover, Good As Hell, Truth Hurts, etc. those are just mid or simply not as good as the original. The Bad Guy remix actively takes away every positive element the song had going for it.

Billie: "Bad Guy", a song that despite 21 weeks on the Dance Club Songs chart never broke the Top 20

Lizzo: "Juice", a song that despite 12 weeks on the Dance Club Songs chart never broke the Top 40

Ariana: "Ghostin", a tasteful and moving ballad

Taylor: "Cruel Summer", a song that Swiffers want as a single acting like she can give it the outdoor promo it would need which oh my god...

For this I wanted to highlight my favorite comment because I don’t have as deep of a connection to this: 

**agentofscranton** (11): this is the saddest song of all time. someone on popjustice said it feels like an intrusion to be able to listen to this song and honestly they're not wrong. this is so intensely private, and personal, and it's so incredibly devastating that it exists. her voice is gorgeous, the production is immaculate, and the lyricism is some of the best that pop music will EVER have to offer. he just comes to visit me when I'm dreaming every now and then is just the most heartbreaking thing to hear, and I'm sorry she ever had to go through this.

---



**bbfan132** (11): wasn’t expecting this stunning ballad from ariana when tu,n came out but this is easily one of her best songs and probably my favorite song in the rate. i will never grow sick of this track.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (11): This is it. Go home everybody else. I already know y'all are going to screw this one over for something stupid. But dammit this song is perfect.

**jmedina16** (11): a once in a career kind of song few artists achieve

**Kromorei** (11): one of the best songs in her discog if not the best. if this gets scores less than a 7 you people need therapy.

**letsallpoo** (11): thank god for scooter

**mayolizard** (11): Oh! MY GOD! I LOVE(R) THIS SONG!!!! IT'S SO GOOD HOLY SHIT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!! SO PRETTY!!!! SO SAD!!!! LITERALLY EVERY EMOTION IS WHAT I FEEL!!!! WOAH!

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I'm not gonna say something like this is only a song ariana could make like she's the only person who ever lost someone she loved, but it's rare that someone who is in the public eye more than ever to be able to articulate their feelings after such an awful series of events and create something as powerful as this song.

**Tedyonce** (11): the best song of her career. wow. popheads' balladphobia better not affect this too much.

**xosam** (11): Ugh words cannot describe how much i love this song, I just had to give it my 11. This is definitely the most raw track shes ever released and you can really feel the emotion through her voice

**1998tweety** (10): Okay this is actually incredibly good and easily one of the best songs in the rate. She made several points here, I love this song.

**akanewasright** (10): Words cannot describe how good I think this song is. It’s so good I can’t believe Ariana wrote it. Like, her lyrics are always a little terrible, but these lyrics are just so damn gorgeous and plain spoken. And there’s literally no one in the world who could have written this besides her.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Her best song to date. It's so beautiful and real and when the orchestra comes in at the end, it's pure heaven.

**bandnitos** (10): i am distraught your honor

**bulforster** (10): :(

**cleen\_claire** (10): this shit hunted me :'(

**cremeebrulee** (10): wow. this song took my breath away on a first listen. i am still shocked she put it out. its just a gorgeous, heartbreaking song. the way she says she should be “ghosting” mac …… i am just in awe. the easiest 10 i’ve given.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely the best song on the album. Ariana really gave it all with the lyrics and the vocals. It's a shame Scter forced Ariana to include the song on the album though. But judging the song itself, "ghosting" is definitely the highlight of the album.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Do not let y'all's intolerance for ballads prevent this perfection from getting into day 3.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): Ironic that I'm giving this song off the album a 10 since she didn't want to put it on the album but rat Scooter gave us one of my favorite song all time from her

**fadedblue09** (10): Truly heart-wrenching. This was the moment my respect for Ariana as an artist really went up, as it shows how she can be personal with her music. Also, I loved how you can interpret the song as being written towards Mac or Pete. If this wins, it honestly deserved it.

**FluffyNobody** (10): Scooter is a POS and this must've been super hard to record, but my oh my if it's not the best song in this album (and one of the bests in this rate)

**george\_kaito** (10): she making me feel things

**hikkaru** (10): sob

**ignitethephoenix** (10): going to judge anyone who gives this song a score below 7. This is one of her best and the most personal song she has ever done and it’s absolutely gorgeous especially with the vocals at the end.

**JanuaryFourteenth** (10): This is truly beautiful like everything just works

**Jimmy345960** (10): DAMN this one should be boring but it fucking kills.

**Johnnytoby** (10): beautiful

**kappyko** (10): not writing an essay but yeah, this would be my 11 if i wasn't just mad instead of depressed right now

**lapascalia** (10): So sad

**leviswift13** (10): see my write-up for the top tracks of 2019 https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/etwkpe/the_top_100_tracks_of_2019_according_to_rpopheads/

**lilacsweetener** (10): What can really be said about such a heart wrenching moment in time? It’s amazing she could even put this into words much less record it and release it. Beautiful harmonies, high notes and such warmth in her voice where you’d think there’d only be coldness and pain.

**meiscool132** (10): amazing to cry to

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): smooth and wonderful, and keeps getting better as the song goes on

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): a tidal wave of emotional devastation. Easily one of the best things she’s ever done

**NotWith10000Men** (10): sonically beautiful. Lyrically beautiful. Perfect.

**pearllouise** (10): screams in gay

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): astonishingly heavenly

**Pooter215218** (10): aris best

**rhyneston3** (10): Wow absolutely beautiful

**runaway3212** (10): Not a single line is wasted in this lyrical masterpiece

**shesdoingyoga** (10): There is not a single flaw to be found

**skargardin** (10): THE best song on the album and that's on periodt

**Stryxen** (10): in my first draft of this my comment was just "periodt!" and yeah... i agree

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): one of the few songs that have made me cry, i'm an Ari stan but i never though we'd see this side to her

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): come on now. a beautiful flawless perfect song

**TiltControls** (10): Gorgeous song and my favourite off the album

**waluigiest** (10): this is the most important song on the record, and shows why the era was not over when Sweetener was released. It really gets at the absolute horror that her life has been the past few years. She’s been through it all and homegirl needs a break.

**wasian-invasion** (10): this song hits me in the gut everytime, no way she could ever perform this live

**wavingwolves** (10): this is by far (we're talking miles and miles here) the best song on this album

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): i understand why she never performed this song live, but damn what i would give to hear it

**materialqirl** (9.5): omg so beautiful + tragic i rlly need to listen more

**Nickl00** (9): like soon you’ll get better, I just love such genuinely sad songs

**nooodisaster** (9): yea, we cryin. from her words to the orchestra to her angelic singing this is heartbreaking on so many levels.

**rsmitty99** (9): Tough song, man.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): ok fuck it im crying

**untutorable** (9): it's so fucking sad i'm emo

**alwayswords** (8.5): i dont listen to this enough because it makes me sad emofish

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): probably ari's best ballad and the only song on the album that was worth releasing so soon after sweetener

**radiofan15** (8.3): Cute and heavenly song that only someone like Ariana could pull off

**anothertown** (8): :wendy williams voice: aw

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Underrated bop.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Gorgeous but it drags a bit. Ending doesn't quite feel as cathartic as I feel like it should, but you can't deny the vo-kills on this one

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Arianators will hate me for this but it doesn't feel like this song does Mac's life the justice Ariana wanted it to.

**wardrum5** (7.5): This isn't the emotional ballad this sub seems to think it is

**anagalisgv** (7): :(

**hadea0090** (7): Lowkey overrated by stans, it's not bad at all. It's quite good but i'm not crying over it uk?

**mms82** (7): beautiful and boring, lyrics are great but it doesn't save the song

**AnimationJava** (6.5): While I think that needy was the best ballad on the album, ghostin is a very hauntingly beautiful song that deserves some credit.

**nick1372** (6): maybe slightly overrated but I really do appreciate the effort

**vayyiqra** (6): :pensive:

**PoppyPigglet** (5.5): It drags a little and I feel like it is a bit directionless...

**Mysario** (5.3): I almost feel like this song would be better without instruments

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is boring sorry

**ManofOranges** (5): I've seen this being one of the songs on this album that people on this sub really praise and personally I don't get it. Well, actually I do get it but it's just not for me. It sounds nice but I feel like I'm just waiting for the next song.

**CarlieScion** (4): Ari you simply cannot have songs be this quiet when you dont ENUNCIATE

**slazenger7** (4): I wouldn't listen to this song voluntarily.

**frogaranaman** (2): girl you're both toxic

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Is this song a genetically engineered termite? Because it’s super boring. I still remember posting my thoughts on this album the day after it came out and singling this out as the most boring track and finding out that everyone else loved it, to this day I don’t understand why because this song is nothing.

**JMez2613** (0): This is super controversial, but I ALWAYS skip this song. It just feels like a soulless take on a super emotional subject, and I feel like it's just telling me to be sad, rather than making me FEEL sad. Even Ari herself on Zach Sang's show just didn't really care for the song too much. Idk, it just doesn't make me sad at all in comparison to say imagine or thank u, next.

**Overall Average**: 7.547 **// Average Controversy:** 2.132

---

**mayolizard** (9.767): omg i LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!! one of my all time faves.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.500): Honestly this album hasn’t aged as well as Sweetener has, but it’s definitely a perfect snapshot of a specific time in Ariana’s life. And I hope that making it healed her in some way.

**franch** (9.225): sorry this is way better than Sweetener

**xosam** (8.958): Probably by favourite album by miss Ariana, there isn't one skippable song for me

**meiscool132** (8.625): more like thank u, repeat

**WeastofEden44** (8.600): While the highs on Sweetener are higher, this is obviously Ari's most consistent album. This is random but I see a lot of myself in Ari and in this album. I see someone who is constantly looking for assurance and struggles with confidence at times. I see someone who has experienced great pain and despite having grown immensely, still feels the effects. I feel for her so deeply and hope she truly finds peace soon. This is an album that has multiple songs that feel somewhat ripped from my life and it's assuring to know that I'm not the only one who feels so deeply isolated at times.

**bespectacIed** (8.417): Should have won AOTY. Ariana being a toptier vocalist excuses the fact that this album is so badly written for the most part. A comedown from Sweetener but it gets a pass because it's impossible to top perfection

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.333): A good album that got kind of outshined by a lot of other records by the end of the year. 11 contenders: imagine, needy, in my head.

**nooodisaster** (8.317): Cover art review - Africana Grande snapped, we need more POC representation like this. 1/10

**wasian-invasion** (8.292): objectively her best album, but idk it's hard to listen to sometimes unless youre in the mood for it

**agentofscranton** (8.167): thank u next > sweetener and that's on pyramid.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.167): It's such a shame that her previous effort Sweetener has been criminally criticized by many of her fans because it's actually a really good album. (I stand by what I said) With that being said, I am glad Ariana made this album just a few months after releasing Sweetener. Given that Ariana received so much coverage during 2018, this is the perfect album that summarized how she felt at that time. Probably thank u, next is a better representation of her mindset in 2018 than Sweetener.

**cremeebrulee** (8.125): 2019 was absolutely ariana’s year. this album is so interesting when you compare it to sweetener (which i loved) because so many of these songs come from a place of pain. i don’t revisit it as much as i do the other albums, but it is also the only album i’ve seen performed live so i wonder how that’ll affect my scores.

**Stryxen** (7.783): this was the only album I didn’t know well going in and every time I listened, I was just as amazed as the time before. just good music innit.

**strangergravityfalls** (7.750): does anyone else think pete davidson is kind of... hot

**nick1372** (7.750): Really thought this one was gonna be an instant classic album but a lot of the tracks don't have the replay value I expected. Still Ariana's most mature and thematically consistent album yet, though.

**Mazike** (7.708): some of the songs are def overrated but it still changed the game

**Mysario** (7.667): kind of a filler-y album overall IMO and I feel that a lot of that just comes down to the history of the album. i think these songs, as incredibly okay a lot of them are, were therapeutic for Ariana to make and that's what matters to her. whether she wanted to show them to the world or she was pressured into it by her label who knows and who cares at this point

**leviswift13** (7.417): ariana's peak. the story she has crafted is incredibly moving and so inspiring. i think there are moments that we could've lived without, but tbh it's a pop classic.

**puberty1** (7.292): my most listened album of 2019, i feel like it didn't age that good (whereas Sweetener is the opposite), but still is pretty good.

**dreamingoutloud92** (7.292): So please feel free to revoke my popheads membership because of this, but I’ve never listened to an Ariana Grande album before. Seriously very impressed with the quality of the production and how personal the lyrics are.

**akanewasright** (7.250): Rating this album track by track feels wrong. This album isn’t a collection of tracks, but a work designed to be heard all at once. It’s one of very few albums that fully transports me and tells a genuine story without being convoluted or anything.

**ManofOranges** (7.167): This is another album that was honestly a disappointment for me on first listen. When it came out I saw many people saying this album was great and when I listened to it for the first time I was left wanting. I've slowly come around on at least part of it, but I really only think that somewhere between a half to two thirds of this album is worth remembering. I would also like to say that I am perplexed by people who think this should've won album of the year, but anyways that's beside the point. This album is fine.

**avenueroy** (7.158): This is my first time listening to this album. Honestly, I was avoiding it because I thought I would dislike it based on how much I hated 7 Rings and BUWYG,IB. I was right to stay away, I really don't like this album. The only two songs I really like are Imagine and Thank U, Next. And Thank U, Next definitely should have been the album closer.

**ReallyCreative** (7.092): A lot of people think this album is worse than Sweetner and while I get that there aren't as many highs, there also aren't as many lows, and the "average" song on this album is just a step up. There are duds on here, there are home runs on here, but I generally enjoy listening to the "filler" of this album more than I do the filler of Sweetner. A respectable third place for me in this rate.

**bulforster** (7.000): Even though this has some of my absolute favourite Ari songs on it, I don't care for pretty much half of it which kind of torpedoes my enjoyment of it as an album.

**cyborglilith** (6.875): has some bops, I like the aesthetic

**fadedblue09** (6.833): I put this in my AOTY Top Ten list last year, but honestly it felt more like a proxy vote for Sweetener, which I only heard after this and I enjoyed more IMO. My biggest issue with this album is that a lot of the songs felt like rehashes of each other, and not all of them were executed well. I felt like if Ariana had taken more time in making the album, we would’ve gotten more interesting stories and perspectives about her experiences. Musically wise, it’s more derivative and not as interesting as Sweetener. Despite that, this album gained my respect for Ariana and I now see her as a full-blown artist. Overall, I understand the acclaim it got and I don’t mind it, even though I felt it could’ve been better.

**hadea0090** (6.792): I liked sweetener much more in terms of production but the production on here is still really good and creative. Lyrically, it's not that much better than sweetener tbh. Lyrics don't bother me for the most part and I listen to ari for the bops, not the heartwrenching lyrics so it's all good.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.667): Honestly, a simple but lovely overview on how her mental health has affected her love life. This is such a good topic to approach, and I think she pulls it off wonderfully.

**FluffyNobody** (6.583): I have reevaluated the album ever since it came back. There are some gems in here, and ghostin is amazing, but all in all, the trap pop style is not something I favour.

**radiofan15** (6.575): Even with some of her most personal and rawest songwriting yet, the very samey production and rushed nature truly sinks this album's full potential [Score: C+]

**mayerjunejuly** (6.208): Ariana's most personal album is aesthetically and sonically pleasing

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.142): This is such a strange album because it has some of Ari’s best and worst moments. It contains some of her most mature, vulnerable, and interesting songwriting, but it also shows her at her trashiest and laziest. Basically a few amazing songs with a lot of filler around them. I used to LOVE Ariana and while I’m still a big fan, this era was where I kind of started to tune out because it just wasn’t worth it to wade through all the bs to find what I like about her. Still very curious about what her next step is going to be, if the next album is fantastic she’ll definitely have me on board.

deleted: **goldentayslight** (6.000): A personal masterpiece

**RandomHypnotica** (5.958): i think that this album was in part a reaction to the slightly negative reactions of some fans to sweetener, but that's a shame, because I think whilst tun has some higher highs, it also has way lower lows. Sweetener as an album feels more cohesive and complete (when are we rating sweetener btw)

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.858): Good album, but the singles are significantly better than the album cuts

**TiltControls** (5.583): I wish I liked this album more than I did. Obviously there are some standouts I really enjoyed (imagine, ghostin, and bad idea especially) but overall the album just feels inconsistent. I've heard to just listen to the album and have fun, but honestly most of this album isn't that enjoyable for me to listen to - especially compared to the other 3 in the rate. She is obviously very talented and it's great that so many have enjoyed this album, but it just didn't work for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.875): half of this album is bops and the other half is god awful so idk how i feel about this

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.533): imagine following up an interesting and well crafted work like sweetener with this

**vayyiqra** (4.417): I do not fuck with this album, I'm sad to say, and I really did try to like it. I've listened to the whole thing quite a few times and don't see what many Popheads see in it. There is some good songwriting, but it feels like every single song here does the same formula of trap beat + keyboard + inarticulate singing with lots of "yuh"s. In an alternate universe, I can see myself really enjoying this, but I think it was spoiled by me hating the lead single when it came out (explained in my comment on it) and taking a while to fully understand the themes of the album. I like that it has a concept, it's very cohesive, it's just a little too samey and underwhelming. On the whole, I vastly prefer Sweetener, which took more risks and was more uneven but is more interesting for it. (Yuh.)

**AlbinoAbsol** (4.208): I have never enjoyed Ariana's voice and this album did not help that feeling in retrospect.

**kappyko** (4.167): am i the only person that thinks, asides from a few songs, this sounds VERY underproduced? like "bloodline" and "NASA" feel like demos

**selegend** (4.083): her worst album by far

DUH. 

This song (not the video, she can choke) is such a song for our time. It is so minimalistic but all of the details that are shown are actually really impressive. The song slaps, it is still something you need to play with the volume all the way up in the car, and DUH has become a massive meme. It’s a perfect recipe for a year defining hit, and the pieces and parts of the song lead to an absolutely deserved Grammys Sweep. 

Bye Billie. You lead the top 10 until you lost it. Farewell sweet princess.

---

**alwayswords** (11): you dont understand… im OBSESSED

**mudkip1** (11): yep she did that

**plastichaxan** (11): this eleven was earned last year as soon as the song completely switched

**1998tweety** (10): Occasionally Billie makes a point and she makes a strong point. I'm glad this smashed cause it's easily one of her best songs. It's cool and different but still super catchy.

**AnimationJava** (10): A masterpiece, Billie's biggest hit by far so far and it's deserved. I can't wait to see her follow-up in the next album cycle.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): There's something about this song that hypes me up even though it's pretty low-key.

**bandnitos** (10): still goes off

**berober04** (10): My #2 11 pointer, may Lizzo not be in the rate next time.

**bespectacIed** (10): This is undeniably a smash, even a non-fan like me could admit. That beat stands out as one of the most enjoyable and memorable beats of the year. The "DUH" is an iconic pop moment. I wanted to deduct a point because that ending breakdown is so unnecessary but the rest of the song is just too good to not be a 10

**bulforster** (10): Duh.

**cashewconstellation** (10): I like it, it made me excited about the album when it came out. Like, it was an event.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): honestly one of the most interesting pop smashes in recent memory. really crisp production and a great melody and that's all you really need

**dreamingoutloud92** (10): I love this as the album opener.

**eeveefan01** (10): this song gets a 10 cause it dethroned Old Town Road

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): duh

**Evanbrooks324** (10): one of my favorites if not my most, I absolutely loved it when I first heard it and I'm glad it smashed on the charts

**frogaranaman** (10): I too love to seduce dads

**ggodisawomann** (10): anyone who doesn't put this at a 10 is w r o n g

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a classic. One of the best and most interesting pop songs to come out recently and she deserves all this success just solely for this song (although her other songs are good too)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way this was legitimately a cultural reset

**J\_Toe** (10): being Australian, I love how fascinated she is with out traffic light noises

**Jimmy345960** (10): remember running to this one, great track even now.

**Johnnytoby** (10): classic, her brother phineas did that

**JunkyGS** (10): fucking bop

**kappyko** (10): yes

**lilacsweetener** (10): Obviously one of the defining 2010s hits and was her first legit push toward icon status. If she’s this strong now, I’m scared of how powerful she’ll be in her 20s.

**mayolizard** (10): smash classic. Literally reset the culture, so you could say it's a cultural reset.

**mms82** (10): ugh such a close contender for my 11. best beat and best billie song. badass billie beats ballad billie every day, and this is peak badass billie. this song deserved all its awards

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this song (and the video) are so creepy and goofy at the same time it's amazing

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song kinda perfectly explains why teenagers are so goddamn terrifying.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): d u h

**radiofan15** (10): DUH

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love this song but ever since I learnt the "drums" in the background of the chorus are actually that noise traffic lights make in Australia I can't help but hear it and it drives me crazy

**rsmitty99** (10): I use to not like this song. But that bass line just gets in your bloodstream. The constant harmony. It's so minimal and works so well

**skargardin** (10): cultural reset to be quite honest, no wonder that this song made her a real household name

**strangergravityfalls** (10): i mean anything based on the wizards of waverly place theme song is bound to be a banger

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): i wasn’t too huge on it when it first came out, but it has grown on me a lot and at this point it’s one of the most important pop songs in recent history. game changer.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): One of the best pop songs in recent memory. The break-down is amazing

**vhqv1997** (10): As tired as I am of having to listen to this song every single day at work, I can't deny that this is a massively well-produced and well-sung song. There's definitely nobody who could pull off this song as well as Billie and Phineas, and this feels like a rare, unique thing that will define how the culture will evolve in the future years.

**waluigiest** (10): I listened to this album the night it came out, not having known her music very well before, and I was FLOORED by this song. I’m glad it got the praise it deserved

**wavingwolves** (10): this song deserved every award it won and that's on that

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): it's a 10, duh

**Mysario** (9.9): one of the biggest songs of the year and (debatably) decade doing well in this rate? colour me surprised!!!

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): duh (yuh)

**FluffyNobody** (9.5): Pure fire

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): This was the perfect choice for the single released with the album drop, I don’t think it would have done as well if it was released before the album

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): I love the braggadocio of this song, compulsively listenable

**anagalisgv** (9): obsessed with the lack of a traditional song structure whatsoever

**cleen\_claire** (9): still bangs idc it ain't overplayed yet baby

**cremeebrulee** (9): an immense grower. the first time my friend introduced it to me, i was like lmao what is this. but overexposure did eventually get to me enjoy it LOL the outro is definitely the best part, although the nonchalant way billie says “duh” is a close second

**george\_kaito** (9): a bop but it starts dragging

**hadea0090** (9): circus music but make it bang

**hawksband** (9): ate ariana up at the grammys

**jayjaysortagay** (9): it's already revolutionising pop music, full stop periodt.

**Kromorei** (9): itsaclassic.gif

**ManofOranges** (9): This song is very very very good. The harmonies and the instrumentals it's all very good. Only issue I have with it is the fucking ending. In my opinion, it ends all the momentum the song had going and just takes me out of it.

**nick1372** (9): this one was a grower but man, it goes hard

**Nickl00** (9): probably the best single of last year

**twat\_brained** (9): If the music video didn't completely rip off Toiletpaper Magazine it'd be a 10

**vayyiqra** (9): The Becky "yuh" vs. the Stacy "duh".

**wardrum5** (9): the first twenty seven times I heard it, I didn't get it. But on the twenty eighth listen, it clicked. It's so unique. The "duh" chorus is amazing. Don't care for the last third as much

**wasian-invasion** (9): im a bad guy im a im a bad guy

deleted: **E3-NotTheConvention** (8.8): Fresh when it came out, fresh today (if u ignore how overplayed it was)

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.6): Why did I resist hopping on this bandwagon for so long?

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): gays and girls who wanted to seduce their friends' dads growing up and do not want to address that part of their psyche in therapy make some fucking noise

**akanewasright** (8.5): It slaps. What else can I say? I might be mad if it wins, but it’s a huge bop.

**anothertown** (8.5): you can really tell the difference in production quality in this song with her backing vocals & harmonies, they sound so much tighter than other girls out there

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Dead obvious that this was going to be the hit of the album, it stood out to me immediately on my first listen of the album and still is great.

**runaway3212** (8.5): This song is truly amazing.

**untutorable** (8.5): the only part i don't like is the weird drop near the end?? other than that....banger

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): The production and melody on this song are great but I wish that the lyrics were a littttle more substantial.

**agentofscranton** (8): i'm getting kinda over it but it still objectively slaps

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): I've listened to this album about seven times now and this is one of the few songs that I actually remember. It's not perfect by any means but I do like it and understand the hype for this one. Not big on the ending though.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSPuRXkUWoU

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This song is really great and catchy. However, she had better songs she released before "bad guy" that deserved more recognition. I am looking at you, Bellyache. That could have been her first huge hit before "bad guy".

**franch** (8): i wanted to like this more than i did

**meiscool132** (8): by now we all know it's really good. and I live for the breakdown

**NotWith10000Men** (8): love this song but I've just heard it so much now

**puberty1** (8): not my favorite single of hers but still pretty good. i was gonna give it a 7 but then remembered about the bridge/outro and that alone deserves one extra point

**rhyneston3** (8): Would be a ten if !!!! was included

**Stryxen** (8): I genuinely don’t understand how people hate this song so much

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8): it's a testament to this song's popularity in australia that i have never gone out of my way to listen to it (till now) and i know every word

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): its good just once youve heard any song so much it's hard to like it as much as you once did

**Austine567** (7): despite being the biggest hit it's my least favorite off of here

**CarlieScion** (7): overplayed as hell but a bop

**Kanne\_** (7): i like the song it's just i heard it too many times, rip

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): /u/imadudeduh [+7]..... DUH!

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This is the same score I gave it in the Billboard rate, don't @ me. It's mostly the beat saving the song here.

**leviswift13** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1e-e_HIZck

**materialqirl** (6): overrated tbh

**JMez2613** (4): this song is too simple and bland to deserve the hype it got

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): ok so this BARELY grew on me in between the decade end rate and this one, but i still don’t understand all the acclaim this song gets. the only good things to come out of this song were all the parodies of it

**RainbowRaider2** (3): Overplayed and overrated.

**pearllouise** (1): lana deserved

**JanuaryFourteenth** (0): Words can’t describe how much this song rubs me the wrong way. It’s somehow both creepy and unconvincing, the lyrics are simple, and worst of all it’s boring, it’s just whispers of stilted bait, and then that drop comes in and it gets even more posturing like Billie I’m sorry but you’re not doing anything to convince me that you can carry this image

**Overall Average**: 7.479 **// Average Controversy:** 1.936

---

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.286): This album deserved each and every single one of its Grammys and I will hear nothing else about it.

**radiofan15** (9.207): Despite some (minor) missteps, this is a generally strong debut and solid collection of tastefully-produced tunes that proves Billie to be worthy of the hype and success she's been getting ever since 2017 [Score: A]

**hadea0090** (8.857): I love how this album tackles multiple subjects and does so with very interesting and fresh production. This album came out while I was transitioning from highschool to college and I've been playing it all of 2019 and it's kind of the soundtrack to my 2019. The fact that it was made by a teenager just made me connect to it even more.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.786): this album is the highlight of these for me, it's just so fresh, passionate and cohesive

**moooo566** (8.643): is this the best album in the rate? yes.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.500): Saboteurs, BTFO. The Grammy sweep wasn't undeserved. 11 contenders: you should see me in a crown, my strange addiction, ilomilo.

**kappyko** (8.429): yeah

**akanewasright** (8.393): I realized as I was rating the album track by track that it’s a little more inconsistent than I remembered it being. The first half is honestly full of songs that I’m conflicted about. But after the midway point, we get a few bops and some of the best music of last year.

**Stryxen** (8.350): iconic album, and even though it can drag a bit at places, it never gets boring. idk what but she said Something Rights!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.321): This is such a great debut album for Billie. Billie's honest songwriting mixed with her brother Finneas' interesting production really made this entire album work.

**wavingwolves** (8.143): this is a very consistent album and i love how it plays around and experiments with different sound textures. it's really interesting and has a lot of little details that elevate the listening experience. it's crazy how huge it was and i love it.

**mayolizard** (8.143): i ended up rating these higher than originally thought

**WeastofEden44** (7.836): Did Billie deserve to sweep like she did? No, but this is still a strong debut and Billie still is an artist with a vision. I still don't quite get what some people like Fantano see in Billie (like she's the most unbelievably amazing artist to come along in years) but I appreciate seeing someone young like her get praise for going against the grain.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.829): Billie Eilish is someone who I think came out too late for me, a pop artist with a theatrical sensibility and a horror focused aesthetic? If she’d been around in high school I would have been OBSESSED and who knows where I would have ended up? But as it stands I think I’m just a bit too jaded to embrace her like I’ve embraced some other artists. I’m very impressed though by how many people DON’T seem to feel the same way and have connected with her no matter what their age or gender or sexuality or whatever. I’ve met straight adult men with children who rave about Billie and have been to her concerts, that’s power. This is going to be an iconic album of the 2010s and I hope Billie can keep her momentum and become one of the defining music forces of the 2020s because she’s a very interesting artist.

**frogaranaman** (7.786): this album is surprisingly strong on this revisit

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.714): I think we'll look back at WWAFA as a classic that'll define the generation, with Billie Eilish being one of the popstars of the future. (any 'plant' comments, your coochie stinks.)

**ReallyCreative** (7.621): It's weird. This isn't an album I would choose to listen to very often, but it's very good. It's not really my style or tempo but it's hard to deny there's a lot of artistry here. My biggest complaint is that too many tracks feel a little barren or compressed. wish you were gay and my strange addiction are two examples of very good songs that get just shy of being truly great songs because of their relatively empty cupboards. Even though it's my second highest rated album here, I'm more interested to see where Billie takes her sound next.

**FluffyNobody** (7.536): I know Billie herself prefers this to the EP, but I have to say, I have a softer spot for that one (it might just be that it's less experimental, so more in line with my taste - I'm too old for teenage music). That said, I love her voice, and this is an incredibly strong debut album

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.457): Great album with an amazing atmosphere, uptempo songs are stronger than the ballads. This album made me a Billie fan

**slazenger7** (7.379): Billie very hit or miss for me. When she's good, she's amazing (e.g., Ocean Eyes). But other times she's just...boring.

**puberty1** (7.321): i wish I didn't liked this one as much as I do tbh

**dreamingoutloud92** (7.321): The album felt a little long for me? I don’t know, a few of the ending, slower songs blended together for me but man, the first half went hard and was a ton of fun. Not sure I’ll revisit, but I can definitely see why people are so excited for her career.

**leviswift13** (7.071): i want to love this album. you don't know how badly i want to love billie. i've tried really hard to *get* her, but i just can't. i think it comes down to the songwriting. i don't think she has really found her groove in the craft of writing. her lyrics just always leave a lot to be desired for me. some really good moments and i def think she is talented (i mean that voice is so good), i just don't love this like i wanted to.

**nick1372** (7.071): I'm probably not enough of a sad teen to really appreciate this album (don't smile at me was way better don't @me) but it's impossible to deny that Billie is a fantastic creative force and will shape pop in the 2010s

**wasian-invasion** (7.036): Really impressive debut but the last few songs kinda die off

**skargardin** (6.857): This wasn't the direction I wanted the album to go in but it was the smartest move career wise for billie obviously, as she gained a unique, strong image that set her apart from well, anyone else really. I don't really listen to it that much but I do appreciate it for what it is. Will be exciting to see how she can follow this one up.

**fadedblue09** (6.857): Among the four albums here, this one is easily the most innovative in terms of production, and I gave her points mostly because of that. Unfortunately, this isn’t really my cup of tea in angst music, and I can only take these in small doses. I’m not fond of her whispery vocal style (which is inaudible sometimes), and some production choices felt questionable or unnecessary. That being said, this is definitely a good showcase of her talent and it easily shows her unique imprint on pop music, as well as a deserving AOTY winner.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.821): The correct AOTY

**Mysario** (6.800): production on this album is fantastic and it sounds ear-gasmic, it deserved every accolade it was awarded. however, that sound is overall not for me... and that's okay!

**vayyiqra** (6.786): Billie really impressed me with this debut. Not in a "this deserves to sweep the Grammys and utterly destroy the competition" way; I wouldn't go that far. However, it was one of the best pop albums from last year for sure, though it didn't make my top 10 (but it would've definitely been in my top 20). I don't love every song on it and I think it wavers a bit at the end with a few weaker tracks, but on the whole this is a very strong album and quite an achievement for someone of her age.

**nooodisaster** (6.536): Cover art review - Matches the album perfectly. In that it's superficially spooky, kinda cringe, clumsy, and super try-hard. 4/10 (6.42 avg)

**ManofOranges** (6.429): This album is definitely my least favorite out of the four in this rate. I would normally just attribute that to the fact that Billie makes music that is different from what I conventionally like but I absolutely love her EP so I am not quite sure what it is that doesn't quite click with me. It also further kinda cements my shock that this won album of the year but I can understand that this is at least very different and can see the justification behind it. It's certainly an.... interesting album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.143): I’ll admit that I dismissed Billie as an overated “edgy” girl for a while but ever since her AOTY win (which she completely deserved, lana stans dni), I’ve taken her much more seriously as an artist. There’s a fair amount of songs on this that don’t click with me but overall, for someone as young as Billie was during this album’s recording, debuts don’t get much more cohesive.

**Mazike** (6.107): I mean it was good but it's not really my personal taste

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.807): This is interesting I guess, but goddamn, NFR deserved that AOTY

**franch** (5.607): i remember when i was so hyped for her based on her EP and how bummed i was when this album sucked. hadn't listened since then. still bummed.

**mayerjunejuly** (5.436): a weirdly satisfying project that goes downhill as it progresses

**goldentayslight** (5.107): unique but lowkey full of skips

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.307): she already swept the grammys she really does not need my internet gay cosign

**bespectacIed** (4.000): I swear I am not sabotaging her, I'm genuinely just not a fan of Billie's vibe and music. I understand that many people do, and that's okay, but I just never found anything enjoyable and interesting from this album. I find Billie so inauthentic and unlikeable. Sorry.

This is the pinnacle of Taylor’s pop deep cuts. This, Getaway Car, Style, the holy trinity of her pure pop masterpieces imo. St. Vincent is also included here, and it was a massive wet dream for me seeing the info come out leading into the album. The chaotic good of this song can be so easily linked to Annie’s hands, and their constant praise of each other is such a feel good thing for me. 

This was number 1 for a long time and almost came back from a 60 point deficit at the very end, we had to wait for the last ballots to decide the winner. 

In the end, Cruel Summer takes 2nd, but at least another great song wins it!

---

**1998tweety** (11): The complete whiplash going from IFTYE to this. Good Lorde now this is a mother fucking song. This is another Taylor song where you can really tell a lot about someone from their score. 7 is the absolute MINIMUM you should be giving this, and no "its overrated" is not a valid reason to score it lowly not matter what you keep telling yourself to justify your complete hatred for a woman you've never met and has never wronged you just because you're bitter she's not a complete bitch like you hoped she was. Anyway. it's always the usual suspects at the bottom of these scores, I hope we've already realized we shouldn't pay them any mind by now ddd

**ceebs\_** (11): absolute bop of last year and this year!

**ggodisawomann** (11): I couldn't not give this my 11. I have nearly 300 plays of it because...well, it's a bop. I will never not sing "he looks up grinning like a devil" as "he looks so pretty like a devil" though

**Jimmy345960** (11): WOW, this song hit my like a truck. I remember listening to this in awe, it reminds me of getaway car but in a cool new different direction. Getaway Car feels like the outside and this feels like the inside of her perspective. This is an amazing track.

**ladililn** (11): I’M DRUNK IN THE BACK OF THE CAR AND I CRIED LIKE A BABY COMING HOME FROM THE BAR, SAID I’M FINE BUT IT WASN’T TRUE I DON’T WANNA KEEP SECRETS JUST TO KEEP YOU! AND I SNUCK IN THROUGH THE GARDEN GATE EVERY NIGHT THAT SUMMER JUST TO SEAL MY FATE, AND I SCREAMED FOR WHATEVER IT’S WORTH I LOVE! YOU! AIN’T! THAT! THE WORST! THING! YOU! EVER HEARD!!!!!!

**leviswift13** (11): i'm not going to say that this song invented music, but i think we all know why mozart and beethoven have been pretty quiet since taylor released this song. it's perfect in every way. the melody is sooooo killer. the way it twists and curves from speak-singing in the verses to the glorious oooooo's of the chorus to the melodramatic chanting of the bridge is SO intoxicating. lyrically, she is at her best. it's a poetic, dramatic, romantic, vivid, emotional and tragic tale of a love that is too much of a, well, breakable heaven. it's pop music at its best.

**lordeofmylife** (11): pop perfection

**materialqirl** (11): BEST SONG ON THIS RATE PERIOD

**MaximumFriendship** (11): Frenzied and feels like the musical equivalent of electricity

**PoppyPigglet** (11): I really forget about I Forgot That You Existed because of this song. I typically start listening to the album from here!

**rsmitty99** (11): I debated giving this an 11 as Ari's album was so much more personal to me. But the whiplash this song gave me after the disappointment of I Forgot that you Existed was palpable. This might be my favorite pop song from the last 10 years. Jack Antonoff always had this care free, outdoor carnival feel to his music and this emphasized that to perfection. This is the best song in this rate. It deserves my 11.

**SFbby** (11): Three minutes of high-speed adrenaline pumping pop perfection mixed with the foreshadowing of corona and a killer scream-along bridge that comes twice

**shhhneak** (11): not making this a single is why 2020 is so cursed.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Taylor didn't have to go and predict Summer 2020 us with this track.

**valus** (11): i cant wait for all the 11s on this (hopefully there is a lot or this is awkward)

**wanderingimpromptu3** (11): A perfect pop song and arguably the best of Swift's career. It's euphoric to listen to, and the care and detail in the lyrics is rare in a song this catchy/uptempo

**wasian-invasion** (11): it’s a cruel cruel summer now pride's gone

**agentofscranton** (10): y'all are gonna drag it and say it's overrated, but I stand by my beliefs when I say this is easily top 5 taylor songs. it's classic taylor songwriting, coupled with amazing pop production. it's the exact kind of music i want her to be making.

**akanewasright** (10): I kinda wish this was the opener. It’s a pure rush of energy, and features the start of Lover’s largest motif - Drunk Taylor. I’m biased because I basically lived this song, but I think the fact that this non-single held the top spot on the r/popheads chart for weeks on end shows that there’s something here.

**alwayswords** (10): if this wins the rate i’m gonna mega fucking fume

**AnimationJava** (10): A masterpiece but I still can't forget how it was such a smash on popheads charts for MONTHS.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Taylor on autopilot, but Taylor on autopilot is SO good! This song is perfection.

**bespectacIed** (10): "We say we'll just screw it up in this trying times, we're not trying" - proof of Taylor's songwriting genius when she actually cared enough to show it in this album

**CarlieScion** (10): this is gonna get sabotaged to hell and back lol. It’s genuinely a GREAT pop song!!!!

**cleen\_claire** (10): Top tier Taylor, should've been the lead single

**CritneySpearz** (10): miss rona ruined her chances at getting a #1 hit with this song SMH SMH

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Taylor always knows how to write a perfect bridge and Cruel Summer is one of them. It's topped with Taylor's emotional vocals in that bridge that perfectly complements the desperation for Taylor's lover in the song.

**dreamingoutloud92** (10): Pop perfection. Could have smashed if it were released as a single in the summer of 2019, Taylor.

**eeveefan01** (10): The lead single that never was, what can i say it was a cruel summer

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I love this, but it's very likely to become a really predictable winner in a rate full of arguably more deserving candidates.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): a big boppp, HE LOOKS SO PRETTY LIKE A DEVIL

**franch** (10): everything i want in a pop girl song tbh

**george\_kaito** (10): HE LOOKS UP GRINNING LIKE A DEVIL

**hawksband** (10): starting to think this wont go #1

**hikkaru** (10): pop perfection periodt

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I can’t believe Taylor predicted COVID-19 /s!Definitely one of the best (if not the best) song on the album. This is the kind of pop stuff I want from Taylor, not whatever ME! and YNTCD are.

**ManofOranges** (10): I fucking loooooooove this song. I know it's been said a million times before but imagine if this were the lead single, truly it would've been amazing to see. I don't think this song is an accurate representation of the rest of the album, but neither is Me, so who cares. It has the tragic lyrics and the 80s sound that make it a grand slam for me. It's transcendental. As much as I'd like to say that this will win, I don't think it will though. It has the disadvantage of being produced by Jack Antonoff, someone who is either loved or hated and nothing in between, and sung by Taylor, who has only ever won one rate, and that was by the narrowest of margins. Truly, I think this song deserves all the praise it gets and then some, but I won't hold my breath.

**meiscool132** (10): Wish I could give two elevens tbh but the "yeah"s throw me a bit off

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i will never ever stop screaming "he looks so pretty like a devil"

**RainbowRaider2** (10): One of my all-time favorite Taylor Swift songs.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Am I tired of this song charting on the Popheads Weekly Top 50? Yes. Am I going to give it a 10 anyway? Yes.

**redgold51** (10): The most fun song to scream in a car

**RosaPalms** (10): I'm not going to say I'm happy that Taylor's public life got eviscerated in 2016, but it got us this song so I mean, kinda?

**shesdoingyoga** (10): If you don’t think the bridge is the best part of the song you’re lying to yourself.

**skargardin** (10): definitely one of Taylor's best pure pop songs. There's hooks for days

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): is there anything to say about this song that hasn't been said

**TiltControls** (10): WHY WAS THIS NOT A SINGLE

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the fact that yall kept this on the popheads charts through the winter was obnoxious however it does live up to the hype. one of her best songs

**twat\_brained** (10): Well, this summer certainly appears to be looking cruel so gg to Taylor for her foreshadowing

**waluigiest** (10): a perfect song. Vocals writing orchestration production everything is BEAUTIFUL

**WeastofEden44** (10): Will this song win the rate? Probably. Is this song a bit overhyped by the twinks? Probably. Is this still a fantastic song? Absolutely

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): why was this not the lead single? what was the reason?

**mms82** (9.9): this isn't the best song on the album or overall, but it's fantastic and earned its spots as the popheads darling

**avenueroy** (9.7): This is going to sweep, and I'm not mad about it

**mayolizard** (9.6): if this wins the rate im k wording myself...

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i want to sabotage this because as much as i adore it, it doesn't deserve the win, but i do just love it so i've knocked it only from a 10 to a 9.5 in protest >:(

**cyborglilith** (9.5): I'M DRUNK IN THE BACK OF THE CAR AND-

**FluffyNobody** (9.5): Did someone already say pop perfection?

**vhqv1997** (9.5): Go off I guess

**anagalisgv** (9): cruuuUUUUUel

**bandnitos** (9): i overplayed this (not as much as y'all did) but it still slaps

**gannade** (9): yes im a twink

**J\_Toe** (9): The vocals compete a bit with the instrumentation (which uses similar techniques to other Jack Antonoff tracks for a number of artists) but it is a good track.

**lapascalia** (9): I hope the rumours that she’ll release this on May 8th are true! Love this.

**nick1372** (9): The lyric is "He looks so pretty like the devil" FUCK you taylor

**Stryxen** (9): I’M grinning like a devil. this just makes me get up and bust a move and I won’t even notice.

**wavingwolves** (9): this surely hits different now that we're living in a pandemic but the bridge is still one of her best

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): overrated by the sub and that chorus melody is done MUCH better on LOONA's Stylish but this is on my running playlist so I cannot hate it

**Mysario** (8.7): this song has not been out long enough to be enjoyed in the middle of Summer

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Ah yes, that one deep cut that Swifties go nuts over. Overall, I do believe it’s overrated, but I will NOT tank this because this album has already enough mediocre songs that are more worthy of low scores.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): This is still slightly overhyped by everyone here but its a fantastic song so I can’t entirely disagree. (also the tomgreg Succession AMV to this song is the most big-brained thing i’ve seen in my life)

**runaway3212** (8.5): An immaculate song but not the best on Lover

**radiofan15** (8.2): How sacrilegious would be to say that this is just cute and slightly overrated?

**letsallpoo** (8): this isn't even better than getaway car

**lilacsweetener** (8): I know this is the golden child song but it’s still the basic Getaway Car. That might be the point though since this is Getaway Car before the benefit of hindsight kicks in.

**Nickl00** (8): pretty good but I don’t see it as anything else

**NotWith10000Men** (8): the bridge gives it an extra point

**plastichaxan** (8): I mean it's a popheads classic for some reasons, y'all made some points

**vayyiqra** (8): Musically it's kind of a rehash of "Getaway Car", but I'm a sucker for Jackoff's 80s synth production, and it was a cruel summer last year around the time this album came out, and it looks like this summer is shaping up to be more of the same. Can't wait!

**cashewconstellation** (7.6): I like it! It's a good song, but far from the best on the album, let alone this rate.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): catchy. anyway cruel winter >>

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.5): I like it more in theory than in execution. Her voice is too under reverb and I constantly want to turn the sound up, because I can't hear her vocals properly.

**untutorable** (7.5): it was an initial fave for me since it sounds like a 1989 reject but it's grown off me a tad. it probably would've been a ten if we had done this rate a few months earlier

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.3): Sorry, but this is just a generically good pop song

**anothertown** (7): A lot of this album is saved by these reverby filters

**axestogrind** (7): This is FINE

**hadea0090** (7): cute and catchy but I would never go out of my way to put it on.

**Johnnytoby** (7): Its kinda stale I dont get the hype also something about the entire audio mixing of this album feels off, highlighted here

**kappyko** (7): it's a cr UwU summer.....

**plantp0wer** (6.7): It sounds a lot like wildest dreams

**puberty1** (6.5): this is 100% winning right

**cremeebrulee** (6): this song is like an 8 AT MOST but no doubt somehow this gonna be top 2 or god forbid, win. y’all are just blinded by how awful the singles were, so this looks amazing in comparison.

**Kromorei** (6): this song is mediocre honestly i think swifties are deaf

**mudkip1** (6): it was good at first now i'm over it. stream future nostalgia xoxo

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (5): It's an okay song. I don't understand everyone's overwhelming love for it, though. And I really don't understand why everyone thinks it would smash? Helloooo, guys, we talk everyday about how songs like this just aren't popular anymore. Many better songs that are just as poppy flop ALL THE TIME.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): The most overrated song of 2019, in my opinion. Style sweetie, I'm sorry for everyone who called this better than you.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): It’s alright but why are y’all replaying this so much? Let the popheads charts breathe!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i liked it until she tried to scream

**jayjaysortagay** (4): not for me, I feel stupid rating this album cause I don't really "get" TS and I know this song is a fan favorite but it's boring to me.

**Sliemy** (4): I honestly find Cruel Summer to be really annoying/noisy, the verses are fine for me, but I do not like the chorus at all on it. I rate mostly on replayability, so like 1 I would instantly change it, 5 not the end of the world but probably would prefer not to listen and 10 is like this is my jam. So like the verses are good, but I dislike the chorus enough that I probably would lean towards skipping it.

**CreepyMannequin** (2): this is….really annoying

---

**Overall Average**: 7.106 **// Average Controversy:** 2.164

---

**leviswift13** (9.500): this is her best record. period. as a swiftie for the past thirteen years, i have watched her grow and change and experiment and transform. i've seen her be a glorious prom queen, a dorky dreamer, an ice queen, a heartbreaker, a star and a young woman looking for a place in this world. after all of that, i think my favorite taylor is taylor swift, the lover. lover, as a record, has everything you could want in a taylor swift album. there's the glorious, dreamy synth-pop of cruel summer, the romantic and hazy waltz of lover, the girlishness of paper rings, the innocence of it's nice to have a friend, the raw self-loathing of the archer, the hushed vulnerability of cornelia street and the hard-won peace of daylight. i am so proud of her for continuing to make art in spite of a 20 year dark night. she is what she loves.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.417): This may be an unpopular opinion within Swifties but Lover is probably in my top three favorite albums by Taylor. Lover shared so many similarities with Red, with both of them being a big volume of songs sharing a main theme with different sounds. Red is about the feelings she had associated with the color, both good and bad. Lover is about her many feelings associated with love, like romance to self-love. While the roll-out may not be perfect, I am also digging the entire aesthetic of Lover as well, even though it may not outsell the ambition of reputation's aesthetic. I think the outro of Daylight perfectly summarized what she wanted to do with this album. "You are what you love", as Taylor said.

**franch** (8.672): soaring past some of the missteps of Reputation, this album is great. not perfect, but every album can't be RED.

**FluffyNobody** (8.544): Shortly after it came out, I said Lover had surpassed Red as my favourite Taylor album. 7 months later, my opinion still holds. It's an amazing album, and even though the lows are particularly low (looking at you, ME!), they're not as bad as other songs in her discography, and they're largely compensated by gorgeous songs. I think t's easier to write about sadness than happiness, and miss Swift here proves she can make you swoon and break your heart just the same, even if she's happy.

**moooo566** (8.500): i love taylor but wow does this album have some serious weak points, and wow she sure did choose to lead with them.

**cyborglilith** (8.428): her second best album, after Red of course

**slazenger7** (8.350): Obviously I love Taylor. That said, there are definitely some misses on this album.

**TiltControls** (8.333): I know some people weren't as big fans of this album, but something about it really fit with me. Though there were a few songs on here I don't think worked (if you're going to put ME! on an album, at least have the Spelling is fun version), the album as a whole was fantastic and was one of my favourites from 2019. DBatC, Daylight, Lover, Cruel Summer, and The Archer would all be easy 11's if rated separately.

**skargardin** (8.222): This is still my favorite Taylor album, even if there are a few missteps, the album as a whole has surprisingly little filler and is just a fun ride throughout the whole thing.

**dreamingoutloud92** (8.139): Overall I think Lover is a great album. It’s not her strongest album by far but I do love the variety the album offers. I think cutting out a few tracks and choosing the correct singles could have improved the album’s reception.

**WeastofEden44** (7.950): This is a frustrating album because if it was a few tracks shorter it would be her best album. So many highs and some stunning deep cuts, but also a lot of filler. The production is pretty nice and it was great to see Taylor mature her writing on some songs, but then there's song like CatastoME! that bring the album down. It wasn't Taylor's overall best and def was not the best album of the year, but there's still a ton to like on the album and I feel like it's... reputation... is worse than it deserves. But I still find myself going back to it and specific songs. It's weird

**Mysario** (7.933): not her best album but it's still a pretty good album with a decent variety of sounds. well, variety when it comes to being a pop superstar. also, can we talk about how this album is the only one of the four that wasn't nominated for Grammy AOTY? the only reason it's in this rate is because PH is dominated by swifites and y'all were scared for 'Norman Fucking Rockwell!' to sweep smh

**twat\_brained** (7.856): this, Red, 1989 and reputation are the only Taylor albums I've heard in full.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.783): So many good songs, but too long and not cohesive enough

**wasian-invasion** (7.722): had the most high points. cut a few songs and it would be my favorite here to replay

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.711): A better version of Red, with a lot of sonic/stylistic diversity. Some of the best songs of her career mixed with some more mediocre work

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.667): Taylor's album discography is the most tired topic in pop music. 11 contenders: The Archer, I Think He Knows, Paper Rings, It's Nice To Have A Friend.

**cashewconstellation** (7.650): The album is good, but not great.

**akanewasright** (7.650): This might be my favorite album of the bunch, but I know it’s not the best. I love it with all most of my heart though.

**Mazike** (7.600): the bops were game changing but damn she could have cut a few tracks

**rsmitty99** (7.350): This album was hit or miss with me. It had some incredible songs including Paper Rings, Lover, The Man, and ESPECIALLY Cruel Summer. But A lot of the ballads just weren't to my liking. It's far too long. A half dozen of these osngs could've been cut to make it more cohesive. It dragged near the end.

**mayolizard** (7.261): its cute but these are mostly worse from my first listen sddsdsgds
[/r/popheads/comments/gll3dy/the_2019_main_pop_girls_rate_day_3_well_its_lover/fqz03sb/]

=====

deleted: **wavingwolves** (7.194): this album could be her best if it wasn't so long and unfocused. what i love here i really love but what i don't... eh. still, it was my most listened album last year because of how much i listened to the same 8 songs of it

**goldentayslight** (7.150): The best album here and that's on period

**ManofOranges** (7.111): I think how much I liked this album when I first came out was severely limited by the expectations I had, and then didn't have when Me came out, for this album. I was expecting something like a return to form I guess since Reputation had come and gone, but that's not what I would call this. I also recall upon first listen thinking that a large portion of the songs on this album were just very generic, and I still hold that opinion, but I think now I just like them more. I can say for certain that I have at least come to really appreciate a select few tracks on this album, and I'm thankful for that, I do however think though that this album is not fantastic and could've been better.

**mayerjunejuly** (7.111): The music industry has never been this immature, full of love and political all at once

**Stryxen** (6.978): this is a GOOD album, but it gets dragged down A LOT by some tracks. Some heavy cutting and this could easily have been some of her best work. As it stands, the Bad gives the rest of it a questionable taste :/

**avenueroy** (6.911): This is honestly the first time I've listened to Lover all the way through, and the first time I've listened to any TS album all the way through since her debut. This kind of makes it seem like I'm not a fan, but I definitely am! I love TS, I was just not a big fan of this album. I think I would be if a handful of songs were shaved off, and the tracks were re-arranged. I've seen other people say similar things here, so I know I'm not alone. I think this album is a bit too long, and is trying to do too many things at once. It's fine. It's fine.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.861): Honestly this is a Top 3 Taylor album, and if you trim the fat a bit, it could honestly be her best.

**agentofscranton** (6.833): so it's coming up on a year now and i think i've finally decided that i don't like this album. cruel summer, death by..., it's nice to have a friend, and miss americana are genuine career highlights, but so much of this album is either just fine / forgettable, or straight up bad, and me is legitimately the worst song she's ever recorded.

**strangergravityfalls** (6.833): love her??? i barely know her

**bespectacIed** (6.722): If you remove I Forgot That You Existed, The Man, Miss Americana, ME, and It's Nice To Have a Friend, the resulting album could have been Taylor's most cohesive and BEST album. That's how misguided Republic, Taylor, and her team are.

**nooodisaster** (6.694): Cover art review - Why does her hair look like it hasn't been washed in 8 weeks and the angle makes her look like a troll. I do love the color scheme tho. 6/10

**cremeebrulee** (6.667): listen this was the first swift era that i was actively invested in— and to say i’m disappointed is like an understatement. i feel like taylor was trying to overcorrect how ““dark”” she went for reputation and in my opinion it just didn’t work. this album is super bloated, has some of her worst songwriting ever, and just feels artificially saccharine. don’t come for me i’m a fan of taylor but i hate that i’m just dismissed as a hater if i talk about how this album is not good.

**fadedblue09** (6.583): Oooh boy, here we go. Personally, as a Swiftie myself, this album still hasn’t clicked with me unlike most fans, and even I liked Reputation (which, despite the trashiness, actually had some interesting moments in it). This album, on the other hand, felt like a record made to pander to the core Swift fanbase, rather than those who see her as a musician. And that would’ve been fine if it weren’t for the glimpses of musical progression Taylor teased in the record, which honestly just left me frustrated for what the album could’ve been (and no, I’m not talking about the promotion for this era. God, I hope Swifties can just let this go).

**nick1372** (6.556): Taylor will never make an album that's just GOOD will she? I had such high hopes...

**radiofan15** (6.422): Featuring some of Taylor's most mature songwriting and also some of her career-lowest points, LOVER is a mixed bad in almost every possible and conceivable way. Also, this album is the perfect example of a release getting dragged down by ludicrous amounts of filler. [Score: C]

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.328): Better than *reputation* but not the return to form I was waiting for. I think my issue with it is that it feels a little… faceless? Like while listening to it I kept thinking “wow this would be great if someone else sang it” because the songs just don’t feel right for Taylor’s voice or persona. I think I’ll give her one more shot with whatever her next album is before I tune out.

**ReallyCreative** (6.233): Oof. This album has some highlights for her career but also has some of least nutritive tracks she's ever released. It's significantly better than reputation, but doesn't come close to 1989 or even Red. Yet another album talking about the haters, yet another album of high school metaphors, this album sets out to do too much in 18 tracks and in many of those tracks accomplishes little to nothing. Bloated beyond belief, just doesn't bring that much new to the equation, and while there are some amazing songs in here, it's a slog to get to them.

**vayyiqra** (6.056): I have mixed feelings about this album, and have since it came out. I like that it's moving towards a lighter, less "edgy" approach after Reputation, because there is only so much of Taylor doing that one can handle before it gets rather silly. I like that she returned to a new wave-inspired sound on some songs, and there are some very pretty ballads. On the whole, I like it less than 1989, but more than all of her pre-1989 work. It's cute, but maybe some songs are a little unsubstantial. She could've left a few cuts out, like the bizarre "London Boy" or the mediocre "You Need to Calm Down", and the album would've been better for it. Side note: why are so many of Taylor's albums so LONG

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.667): I guess Taylor's biggest love, once more, is her reputation. The love songs are nice, tho.

**Tedyonce** (5.667): the most overrated album of 2019. reputation was a lot better

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5.667): easily her most boring album. Has some good songs, but more often than not ends up in synthpop pastiche. I'd lay most of the blame on Antonoff. I get that he's Taylor's friend and they like working together, but I can't help but think how much polished and unique the album could have been if someone better had produced it.

**puberty1** (5.639): yeah, im just not a big fan of this album. too long, a lot of skipabble songs and the good just get lost in the middle. it's my least favorite album of the rate and honestly even though I hated reputation at the time I would probably put before rate in my Taylor album rankings. Speak Now still the GOAT tho

**selegend** (5.500): her worst pop album i’m sorry

**kappyko** (5.222): "quarantine isn't that boring!" quarantine:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.111): If Taylor trimmed this album down to the best 12 or 13 so tracks it would easily be a much better album

**hadea0090** (5.028): I have never been the biggest TS fan but whenever I listen to her albums, I do find a couple of songs that I really like. However, despite being 18 tracks long, no song really stood out to me (except maybe false god) and it felt really bloated. Even though I liked the production of some songs the lyrics really ruin it for me. Also the whole album sounds like 2013 for some reason?

**RandomHypnotica** (4.972): This album, like much of Taylor's discography just never really clicked for me. It can't say any of it was particularly bad, but barely any of it was very memorable either. I'd be dissapointed if this album sweeped the others majorly.

Stream Juice (and Cruel Summer for All Stars 4) 

---

**abysmalglimmer** (11): ik it’s a bit of a meme at this point but this song is fire

**Awkward\_King** (11): f*** u choli exgbox

**bespectacIed** (11): One of the best pop songs released in existence. I remember listening to it the first tike and just being whiplashed by how monumental this is. S T R E A M J U I C E

**cremeebrulee** (11): there was never a competition for my 11. this is the only song that deserves it. stream juice.

**dreamingoutloud92** (11): Confession, I only listened to this song because popheads circle jerk told me too and I have no regrets. This song has been on repeat for the past year and no other song deserves the 11.

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Early January 2019. Depressed after having a shitty NYE, having finished binge-watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine on Netflix, I open up YouTube and see a recommendation of a music video with under 50k views. I ignore it. It doesn't go away. It stays where for a solid few days without going ANYWHERE and the views barely increase. Then, I give in and tap. The rest is herstory.

**hikkaru** (11): juice

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Look there’s multiple 11 possibilities from each artist here for me but I have to give it to this song. This song is what we need right now, just pure happiness and fun. Lizzo really hit it out of the park with and it yes popheads needs to keep telling people to stream juice as it should be a hit especially over some of her other songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): its fine

**J\_Toe** (11): I love how much this album is a celebration of black culture and history through it's eclectic borrowing from music genres created by black artists. Likewise, I appreciate how Lizzo used this video to display the diversity of black hair (candy curls, braids, baby hairs, perms, natural, etc).

**kappyko** (11): IIRC i think i made the juice theme on PHCJ myself actually. in a way you can thank me for this song being as successful as it was among us Pop Heads xo i am directly responsible for the next pop girl

**ManofOranges** (11): Ah yes, the song of seemingly unending affection and circlejerk from this sub and its periphery. When this song first came out I saw the sheer amount of praise it got and totally did not get it. Honestly, the amount of people constantly saying how good it was and all that almost got on my nerves to the point where I almost hated this song. For this rate I promised myself I would try to forget about my soured opinions on this song because of those things though and listened to it with open ears and it really is amazing. Now, do I think it is like THAT bitch? No, and I stand by that, but it is nothing short of astounding. I honestly think it might even get my 11 because I'm still not sure who to give it to and this song is certainly worthy of it.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (11): what you want me to say? all i have to say is that this song is A FUCKING BANGER

**nick1372** (11): listening to this song once made my ass 10x fatter

**ReallyCreative** (11): 100% Pure, Freshly Streamed Juice

**rotating3Dtext** (11): deserved to be a hit

**shaniquasharkesha** (11): r/phcj i am giving you everything i can

**shesdoingyoga** (11): This song has the distinction of being one of the few songs that never fails to improve my mood no matter how down I’m feeling, and for that it gets my 11

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): I could write a full essay about all the things that make this song great, but like, do I really need to? This is just a song that’s clearly perfection from start to finish, it’s greatness is obvious from first listen and doesn’t need a pretentious essay to explain it’s quality. also obligatory stream juice comment

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): so disgusting that this song lost to gone. that autotuned mess of a song will never be able to compare to the amount of talent that juice exudes. really embarrasing that we have devolved this much as a sub. every single one of you twinks should be absolutely ashamed. all of you. maybe some self reflection would do y'all some good but i think it's beyond saving at this point. just going to give this my 11 to be on the right side of history and hopefully it will win. unless all the gays give tun their 11s or something? idk. can't even picture that reality so i won't. enyway stream juice

**twat\_brained** (11): I can't really see any songs other than this one winning. Maybe a Billie song but I'm pretty sure Juice has this on lock. There was just nothing like it in 2019!

**waluigiest** (11): I adored this song when it came out at the start of 2019, and I still love it. This song deserved to be up with OTR, Bad Guy, and Truth Hurts in terms of 2019 cultural impact.

**wavingwolves** (11): i don't care what anyone says this was the top popheads song from 2019

**1998tweety** (10): Stream Juice

**agentofscranton** (10): i had a night out with my friends last spring and ended up hearing this song twice in two different gay clubs. when it's right it's right.

**anagalisgv** (10): STREAM JUICE

**Anthony-Vince** (10): stream Juice

**axestogrind** (10): I do be streaming Juice doe

**bandnitos** (10): stream juice

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): It Ain't her fault no one realized this song should have been more successful. Well hopefully in five years it'll rechart like her other singles.

**bulforster** (10): Stream Juice

**cleen\_claire** (10): Juice? By Lizzo? Never heard of her

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): omg nostalgia for times hearing this in a club feel like pure shit just want public gatherings back

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): r/popheadscirclejerk

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely one of my contenders for my 11 but my Swiftie ass is going to give Taylor an 11. Regardless, the production of this is so fresh and retro at the same time. I am glad I found and stan Lizzo through this song. I just wish Juice got the same level of success as Truth Hurts.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): , hyped for a reason, the lyrics are funny and she sings this really well for what this song is

**fadedblue09** (10): Rate winner WHEW. One of PHCJ's only good contributions to this world.

**FluffyNobody** (10): I played this song with my ex flatmate's Alexa approximately 100 times and pestered everyone around me, and I just gotta say, no regrets

**ggodisawomann** (10): omg also an 11 contender, I STANNED this from the first time I heard it!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): [In case any of you were gonna try and say this is overrated since it’s been meme’d to death, here’s the receipts!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/agn47l/the_popheads_jukebox_week_100/ee7d4w1/) You’ll notice that I gave it a 9 there and a 10 here, and that’s because while I still believe that there are definitely some cracks in the song (it’s a bit plastic and the guitar is repetitive) and there are stronger songs on this very album, there are few songs in the rate stronger than it. This is just… iconic. Plenty of songs in this rate will be *remembered* in years to come, but this is the one that’s gonna make everybody lose their minds when it comes on at a party in six years.

**hadea0090** (10): do i have to say it? stream juice

**jayjaysortagay** (10): stream juice all quarantine boys

**Jimmy345960** (10): What a bop

**Johnnytoby** (10): that same horrid ex also showed me this song so maybe he made some points

**Kromorei** (10): does this rly need explaining

**lapascalia** (10): I still don’t get how Truth Hurts is Lizzo’s breakout song over this one ?!?

**letsallpoo** (10): it's okay

**leviswift13** (10): i can't with this song.

**materialqirl** (10): fave song from her periodt

**mayolizard** (10): if this wins im k wording myself [2] that would be so predictable…. smh

**meiscool132** (10): it's the whole damn meal

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): God I don’t understand why this wasn’t a hit. Stream Juice.

**Nickl00** (10): I didn’t like it at first and I don’t understand how I could ever not like this

**NotWith10000Men** (10): yes I love that groovy shit

**pearllouise** (10): r/popheadscirclejerk loves this song so much it could marry it

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the pinnacle of music, stream juice today for clear skin

**puberty1** (10): i really REALLY hope this song wins. for me, it's the perfect pop song and the one that really represents popheads to me: a messy place that at the end just want to have fun while bopping. stream juice

**radiofan15** (10): #StreamJuiceIGuess

**rhyneston3** (10): So funky, such a jam, just wonderful

**rsmitty99** (10): Can I have two 11s? No? Ughh. Fine.

**runaway3212** (10): STREAM JUICE!

**SFbby** (10): Stream Juice

**skargardin** (10): Loved this the instant I heard it and it still is just as fun as the first time!

**Stryxen** (10): she deserves the win and you ALL know it the low scores are LYING

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): a masterpiece

**TiltControls** (10): stream juice 2021

**untutorable** (10): i'll leave it to /r/popheadscirclejerk to tell you to stream this but there's no denying its quality

**wasian-invasion** (10): poor juice she's gone through so much these past few months but i just couldnt give her my 11

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (10): this song makes for a good meme but it's geniunely worthy of an 11

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): stream juice

**Mysario** (9.9): y'all tryna play [Rock Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCIejHjDM1o)? who wants to be the singer?

**0x976** (9.5): would be a ten if it wasnt for the bridge

**Kanne\_** (9.5): would have given it a 10 but i listened to it one too many times, still love it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): so much fun!

**WeastofEden44** (9.5): Amazing song but the hype on the sub did get old fast

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.1): Never get tired of this, this totally deseved be at least top 5. Not rating it 10 just because that sliglhtly awkward interlude #JusticeForJuice.

**Agusarg** (9): insert stream juice joke here

**Mazike** (7.8): pop heads circlejerk deserved better

**george\_kaito** (7): i thought this was bruno mars for a hot second

**hawksband** (7): like fantano they 7ing me

**nooodisaster** (7): Joyous silly fun.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): its fun and I totally get the love for it, but I always felt like this was more of a collection of instagram captions set to a beat than a song so I’ve only ever been able to enjoy it so much

**JanuaryFourteenth** (6): The juice is loose and it’s disco

**akanewasright** (5.5): This song lost all replay value for me at some point. I’m really sorry, but I overplayed this HARD and I can’t really listen to it anymore. I had to skip it when I was relistening to the album for the rate, and I did not do that for any of the shitty songs in the rate. I did not skip London Boy, for fuck’s sake.

**Brendon-Urine** (5): overrated sorry

**mms82** (5): really don't get the hype for this song

**vhqv1997** (5): I really don't like that chorus. The adlibs are just really annoying and ruined the really good verses in the song.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.5): It’s catchy for sure, don’t like the “ya ya yee” part

**maddieg18** (4): I'm sorry, maybe I just hate fun but this doesn't do anything for me at all. I really like the soulful side of lizzo, cuz I love you and jerome baby, but this just doesn't seem right?

**AnimationJava** (3.5): STREAM JUICE STREAM JUICE STREAM JUICE STREAM JUICE

**gannade** (3.5): this is a CRJ song but somehow whiter

**animefangrant62** (2): (The epitome of mom pop.)

**PoppyPigglet** (2): im sorry im sorry im sorry but watching this sub ride this song's dick for so long made me despise it and it is a bit cringe inducing when I hear it now.

**Overall Average**: 7.511 **// Average Controversy:** 1.829

---

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.400): A fantastic R&B record. Lizzo really can do it all and she deserves every bit of success she gets. Stream Juice.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.133): The score says it all. 11 contenders: Juice, Tempo, Boys, Water Me.

**ReallyCreative** (8.947): A fun album from start to finish, with the deluxe tracks being familiar power bops from Lizzo's discography. Easily the most consistent album in this rate, the least filler, the highest highs, and the fewest lows. Lizzo served excellence and fun the way only she could. Juice remains the track of the century, stream Juice!

**wavingwolves** (8.833): the most enjoyable album of 2019 by a large margin. i love lizzo's energy and i think she's really charismatic. i can't imagine anyone else singing most of these songs, which makes her very authentic in my eyes.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.700): The album was fire from start to finish. Lizzo delivered a great, cohesive debut and I really can't wait where Lizzo will go next.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.647): The best album in the rate, hands down, bar none, and it’s neither funny nor a contest. I’ve heard people complain that this album is “too loud” but if it’s the word of the lord, why should you whisper it? The biggest flaw that this album has is the tacked on deluxe tracks and how they disrupt the flow of it, and maybe that the tracks are too short. Otherwise it’s nonstop feel good fun that I can put on at a moment’s notice and enjoy. I’ve been a Lizzo fan for years and her inexplicably meteoric rise to fame is beyond my wildest dreams, she’s the popstar that we need and I desperately hope that whatever her next album is can continue this success (though I unfortunately don’t see it happening given the lukewarm commercial success of the songs actually written for this album).

**WeastofEden44** (8.647): This was such an incredible surprise. I had gotten use to the idea of Lizzo being an unkown icon and then everything changed overnight. This album is the culmination of so much work for her, both in reference to her creation of the album and the work she's put in her entire career. I love this album. It's a breath of fresh air. Truthfully, I don't return to it much anymore but I'm kinda fine with that. When I do listen to it, I'm reminded of why I fell in love with her to begin with.

**bespectacIed** (8.533): Undeniably the best album in this rate. I won't yield to the Lizzo hate that has started to fester after she got her biggest commercial break. Lizzo is a talented, charismatic pop star and Cuz I Love You is a testament to that.

**cremeebrulee** (8.400): not to be all annoying about this but i’m glad popheads introduced me to lizzo before she blew up. this album is full of bops and honestly all the confidence and self-love that lizzo preached on it is soooo contagious. i played this for my girlfriends on a road trip once and they were all enjoying it and pretty soon this album was on heavy rotation for all of us last year. even my least favorite song on the album (boys) is a still an objectively great pop song. this will probably be my highest rated album and it def deserves it.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.333): I feel bad for giving high scores for all the non-album tracks that got slapped here, but at the same time, I didn't lie.

**hadea0090** (8.267): I love how energetic this album is. The vocals and the production are really grand and

**Mysario** (8.227): you could put Lizzo's voice over anything and it would sound amazing. there's a lot to appreciate in this album but I'm not the right person to ask to articulate that properly

**agentofscranton** (8.200): for an artist so exciting and bouncy as lizzo, this is kind of a drag to listen to. thank god for the added songs (which are all better than 90% of the main album)

**moooo566** (8.133): i'll be honest i never gave lizzo much notice, but ive now concluded that was a mistake

**skargardin** (8.067): A somewhat messy debut album but it gets its point across with a couple of missteps, such as lingerie, like cmon, you could've ended the album on a more euphoric note. And the fact that the super deluxe's songs are among some of the album's best songs is pretty telling.

**radiofan15** (8.033): A serviceable album full of upbeat and catchy songs with just enough memorable songs to truly elevate it from averageness while also having enough bland songs in it to prevent it from reaching a higher spot. [Score: B+]

**Stryxen** (7.947): she snapped, she went OFF, every track just adds and adds, and the bonus tracks could easily fit into the standard album. THAT is what she did.

**kappyko** (7.800): we should have known they were going to do some industry magic for lizzo as soon as her indie albums got removed. this has nothing to do with meghan trainor.

**dreamingoutloud92** (7.800): I wish I had like 1/10th of the creativity Lizzo has - her hooks and one-liners are iconic. Fun album and so glad she’s finally made it big!

**wasian-invasion** (7.733): pretty good, but i'm stealing fantano's line when he said that it feels like a collection of songs trying to be singles

**puberty1** (7.467): it's really hard to rate this album, because I feel like most songs are really good but I'm rarely in the mood for them. I would guess that it got my highest averages, but it's the least listened album of the rate by far.

**nick1372** (7.467): Without all the old songs tacked on, this album's a bit supbar to be completely honest. I can't wait to see what Lizzo does with her next project because she has such potential and such a diverse set of talents, but this one could be a bit cleaner.

**fadedblue09** (7.387): The album was pretty enjoyable. Lizzo’s vocals and personality serve as the highlight of the songs, and her ability to mix hip-hop and soul is what makes her stand out in the ever-crowded field of pop music. My biggest problem is that not all of the songs here do a good job of showcasing her talent. Some songs have structures and production choices that simply don’t work, while there are also times she tends to overuse her voice which sometimes cheapens the songs. Despite that, there really is no awful song here, and I can totally see her making something iconic in the future.

**leviswift13** (7.333): i think lizzo is doing really important stuff in the entertainment industry and society in general. seeing this beautiful, bold, talented plus-size woman of color slaying the game is so inspiring. that said, i still think there's a lot of room to grow and explore. i will say that i tend to respond to emotional songs rather than bops, but i think she has more depth than the album shows. still, some really great pops and melodies.

**ManofOranges** (7.300): This album definitely has its fair share of great songs. It actually got the most 10s from me out of any album in this rate, which I was not at all expecting but do not mind. The main issues I have with this album are, like I mentioned in some comments, the choice lyrics and, like I mentioned in some other comments, the monotony of some of the songs. To me it really does get to a point where I feel like she's yelling a lot and I'm kinda wondering if that's okay for her voice. Although I'm also not a singer nor a vocal coach so I could just be talking out of my ass. Anyways, I'm glad I listened to this album because I think it's actually one of the better albums in this rate, if not the best.

**Mazike** (7.140): no skips

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.100): Lizzo is a burst of high energy fresh air that the pop music world has desperately been needing for a while now. Even at her worst, she still manages to bring her inspiration, feel-good attitude to any track. That being said though, I’m not a big fan of the old songs she tacked on to the deluxe version for extra streams, not only because of the cheapness that such a tactic has, but also because they’re simply not as good as the first 11 tracks of this “debut”.

**nooodisaster** (6.867): Cover art review - The statement this makes is simple but effective. Good color scheme, no weird angle. It's a little too somber for what the album is but beyond that, nice. 8/10

**mayolizard** (6.453): aged pretty poorly for me

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.433): I'm not a fan of this album and Lizzo, but I try to be as fair as I can

**vayyiqra** (6.133): I did the first three albums in this rate right after it the hosts put up the thread and procrastinated on this album for weeks. I have never been interested in Lizzo, aside from a couple of songs ("Tempo" is a banger) and while I respect her for her woke lyrics - here I am using that word unironically - I still don't particularly care for her music. Since this rate was so incredibly fucking long, I would've preferred to leave out this album and put it in a different rate. However I enjoyed it overall and though I probably won't go back to it much, there are some real bops on here. Stream "Juice".

**mayerjunejuly** (5.413): Lizzo's production is dazzling but her voice is somewhat irritating

**FluffyNobody** (5.200): It was the first time I listened to it in full, and I'm sad to report, this didn't blow me away. I was very hopeful when I heard Like a Girl, but then there were many songs that simply were not for me. I'll keep streaming Juice, but that's it

**goldentayslight** (5.033): I don't feel Lizzo's music at all but the overall rhythm is appealing

**franch** (4.533): yeah i don't get it

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3.000): Everything is too loud and yell-y for me, it’s just a grating experience

##2020 Main Nostaglic Pop Rate: Future Nostalgia v. After Hours v. Chromatica

What do you guys think?

cremeebrulee: maybe katy perry's new album instead of after hours? i don't see the weeknd fitting in here since i can only see 3 of the tracks being pop
[/r/popheads/comments/gll3dy/the_2019_main_pop_girls_rate_day_3_well_its_lover/fqz5w9s/]

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I paired After Hours because it fits thematically with Future Nostalgia and Chromatica in terms of nostalgic aesthetic.

However, Weeknd can be easily be switched to Katy and the rate would be just be re-branded as 2020 Main Pop Girls Rate.
