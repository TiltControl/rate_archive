The 2019 Main Pop Girls Rate Day 1: When we all fall asleep, THIS is where we go.
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/gkhho6/the_2019_main_pop_girls_rate_day_1_when_we_all/

Well we made it. 

We will begin revealing day 1 of the 2019 Main Pop Girls Rate here at **6pm EST**. We will be revealing tracks #59 - #41, and the first 6 bonus rate songs

Join us here in this thread as we post total scores and comments for each song, and also in the plug, which we have revived for this reveal, located **[here](https://plug.dj/popheads/)**

--- 

We had 236 amazing participants, all of which can be found **[here](https://pastebin.com/7MiNHmdZ)**. This makes this rate the most participated in rate ever on /r/popheads. 

In addition to that fun fact, here are some additional notes to take into account before we begin revealing: 

The average score was 7.389, that means that anything below this sucks, and anything above it is actually good. 

The average controversy score was 2.021, that means that anything below it is ~~a song by Ariana, and anything above it is a song by Taylor~~ a non-controversial placement, and anything above it was a controversial song.

WeastofEden44: Predictions:

Taylor won't win because Cruel Summer and Lover will split the vote far too much. 

Completely random ass song or two make it into the Top 10. My guesses are Death By A Thousand Cuts, in my head, and Heaven Help Me

Lover is generally agreed to be a very good albeit bloated album, but the tracks themselves are polarizing and aside from laME! and YNTCD, no one can quite agree on which songs should be cut (and even those songs def have their fans). Due to this, Lover will have a wild performance and some songs will have kinda weird scores. The album will span the entire list. 

Lizzo will be the dark horse of the competition. If she isn't steamrolled today, she could end up with a lot of songs placing quite high. 

I could see Billie doing sorta underwhelming. A lot of stans are still pressed over her Grammy clean sweep and could have given her lesser scores.

Top 10 prediction (ordered by artist): Cruel Summer, Lover, Paper Rings, DBATC, bad guy, my strange addiction, thank u next, bad idea, ghostin, Juice

i hate to be the one to say this, but there’s at least 5 free trap tracks available on youtube that sound exactly like 7 rings

---

**TragicKingdom1 (10): throwback to when we all became music theorists and copyright law experts** (*ricki note: this and the dark horse lawsuit taught us everything we need to know about laws**)

**jimmy345960** (0): did not steal from juice

**bespectacIed** (7): If 7 rings were a good song I would be furious but it isn't so no one wins

**fadedblue09 (7): I wouldn't say 'copying' but more like "Frankensteining".

**ReallyCreative** (4): It's a shame it didn't copy any GOOD songs

**radiofan15** (1): Imagine copying so many talented performers and yet coming up with such a crappy tune.


#it’s mine, i bought it, it’s mine, i bought it

**wavingwolves** (10): i love that princess nokia video bc she looks so good ugh i have the biggest crush on her

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): "Oh. Ohhhhhhh. Hmmmm. Does that familiar to you? Cause it does sound familiar to me! Oh my God! Wait, ain't that the little song I made about brown women and her hair? Hmmm....sounds about white."

**puberty1** (2): she got 2 Chainz in a remix and Nokia kinda went nowhere? not a big controversy to be honest

**leviswift13** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRqRvMxyaKw


#everyone does it so it’s fine

**meiscool132** (6): which song doesn't copy others these days, on purpose or not

**Tolk1en** (3): boring controversy, nowadays everyone seems to be "copying"on everyone, that's most of the time exagerated. Where do we stop ? Everyone is also copying on Beethoven and Bach for setting the rules of harmony ?

**E3-NotTheConvention** (2): Meh, is there a pop hit without any copyright accusations?

**LeninaCrowne94** (2): What song isn't accused of copying these days?

**runaway3212** (1): ‘copying’ drama is never entertaining and almost always stupid. Sometimes songs sound alike, that does not mean they are the same

akanewasright: It’s lowkey kinda nice giving your 11 to a song that you know absolutely will not win. I gave mine to a deep cut album track that some people don’t like very much, and it’s nice that I’m not ~~gonna be disappointed when Cruel Summer loses~~ going to be too invested in this. 

I will yell at people needlessly, though. That’s just the culture of these rates.

I’m doing this write-up a whole month in advance, because at no point in this rate has this song left the last spot.

ME!, the song responsible for sad tears of Swifties and multiple thinkpieces and discussion thread titled “DAE Taylor Swift Flop?”. Although it being far from the worst releases from last year, it sure was one of the most disappointing. After the dark themed *reputation*, releasing the song equivalent of a *Justice* t-shirt was a polarizing move, but the saccharine hook and production weren’t the things that doomed this song, it was the incredibly weak lyrics that talk down to its audience so much it’s insulting. It’s dumb, and not the *innocent, joyous and fun” type of dumb, but the “idiotic, badly thought-out and unclever* type of dumb. ME! tried to be the first seasons of *Spongebob*, and it ended up being *Fanboy & Chum Chum*. The album was not by any means a failure, but releasing this song as a lead single made a lot of damage to the *reputation™* of this era, which is interesting considering that honestly it’s a pretty inoffensive song, but knowing that Taylor has released songs way better  in every aspect, and some of them are even on Lover, I can’t be angry at people for having some resentment towards this song.

There were also a lot of people upset with the erasure of “Hey kids! Spelling is fun”, which I agree with. You can’t break the internet with one single phrase and then act like it never existed Taylor.
---

**AnimationJava** (10): Overhated.

**animefangrant62** (10): (This reminds me of a song from a Disney Channel Original Movie so how couldn't I love it?)

**bandnitos** (10): FUCK YOU ALL

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I know this song is going to go out on Day 1 so I am giving this a 10. This song really made me so happy because I was under constant stress with school and my personal problems. You have no idea how excited I was when Taylor started teasing the rollout of the era and my classmates got to witness that, unfortunately, LOL. For the song itself, I would argue that ME! is actually the perfect lead single for Lover because it gave us an idea of Taylor's aesthetic for the era. I am still surprised how Brendon Urie's vocals complement well with Taylor's. Who would have thought that an emo rockstar and a country superstar would end up being popstars that collaborate together and they have chemistry actually?????

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Her second best lead single after LWYMMD, don't @ME!.

**fadedblue09** (10): At least this collab sounds like an actual collab!

**kappyko** (10): this is a hotter take than my favorite song on 1989 being shake it off. this is like the only song on the album that feels like living people made it instead of giant aliens. the drums are dynamic. the chorus is buoyant!

**lilacsweetener** (10): fuck all y’all this song is great 🖕🏻 It demonstrates emotional maturity in a serious relationship where one fight isn’t enough to end it, showing they work their way back to each other because they’re in LOVE and want to last. The childish sound is IRONIC and “hey kids” is blatant sarcasm because kids would not get what’s actually being said here. Y’all missed the point so hard she literally deleted it all together. Maybe she didn’t blend the irony well enough but the point of being childlike was never lost on me, the song is literally CALLED ME WHILE BEING A DUET ABOUT HOW TWO PEOPLE BUILD A RELATIONSHIP AS A TEAM!!

**mayolizard** (10): i am leaving a comment saying i really like this song but i am also fearing.. Will I get bullied for this? Please don't bully me popheads

**mms82** (10): would earn my 11 if she didn't cut the spelling is fun line

**wavingwolves** (10): this is mindless fun and people took it way to seriously. i find it very infectious and charming and i don't get the hate.

**walkeddowntheblock** (8.8): It's so joyous, I can't hate it.

**franch** (8.5): i don't get the hate. it's a fun silly bop! justice for "hey kids, spelling is fun!"

**wardrum5** (8.4): If this were a deep-cut, it would be beloved. And Brendon kills it. You guys can complain while I enjoy this

**Anthony-Vince** (8): Anyone who gives this a 0 is wrong

**cyborglilith** (8): grew on me bigly

**hikkaru** (8): taylor is a coward for removing "hey kids, spelling is fun!"

**meiscool132** (8): it's fun! just like [removed]!

**muchopartymuchomoney** (8): i can't decide if this song is cute and overhated, or if it's indeed too bland and Disney-ish and has no business being in an album as good as this. and honestly, i tend towards the former.

**Mysario** (8): HEY KIDS, removing lines from the song and corrupting the artist's vision IS FUN

**patcheso8** (8): cute

**SFbby** (8): This is a good song and

deleted: **akanewasright** (7): I was totally going to give this song a lower score, but I just like this song. It’s dumb, but it makes me happy. I was smiling my ass off and giggling like a 5 year old when I watched the video for the first time. “Spelling is Fun” was honest to god my favorite part though, I dropped this score a little because it got cut from the album.

**cashewconstellation** (7): You know, this is actually kinda good. Not very good, but kinda good.

**dreamingoutloud92** (7): Justice for “spelling is fun!”

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Small brain - ME! Is a terrible song. Big brain - ME! Is an amazing song. Galaxy brain - ME! Is an alright song

**letsallpoo** (7): wouldve been a 10 with the spelling is fun line

**leviswift13** (7): should it have been the lead single? not at all. is it still cute? yes.

**NapsAndNetflix** (7): honestly way over hated

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ok YES i know the lyrics are bad but like…if you ignore the lyrics its a cute bop

**untutorable** (7): you know what i don't feel like justifying the score i'm giving this so i'm just gonna name what is literally my one gripe about this song... the title. and not the me! part. the feature. brendon urie is the only fucking member of panic at the disco. you could've just put (feat. Panic! at the Disco) WE ALL KNOW WHO IT IS. WE ALL KNOW IT'S JUST HIM OK THIS REALLY BOTHERS ME

**vayyiqra** (7): As a longtime rate contrarian, I feel oddly compelled to defend this song. It follows in a fine tradition of dumb, fun Taylor singles like "Shake It Off", "Bad Blood", and "Look What You Made Me Do", all of which I like precisely because they're dumb and fun. It's a little cringe, but Taylor wouldn't be Taylor without that. This is a self-love anthem! And you know what, spelling is fun. I will not be taking phone calls.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): Brendon's part made me realize that the only reason I don't hate this song is because I love Taylor way too much, because as soon as his part starts, I understand the hatred it got

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): well

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): yes it is the kidz bop version of itself however it works for what it is

**WeastofEden44** (6.5): I like this song way more than most but I can't ethically rate it much more than this. For me it's a 7 but in reality it's a like 5 so this score will do.

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.4): You know what? I like it. Spelling is fun.

**abysmalglimmer** (6.3): I feel like I’m supposed to hate this but like I don’t

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.3): i hated this song at first but the catchiness grew on me. also in a weird spot on the album

**slazenger7** (6.2): Not as bad as everyone says, but definitely a letdown after Taylor's whole countdown and everything.

**anagalisgv** (6): turns out spelling isn't that fun

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): Where did we go wrong with this one? I mean, it had potential! It truly does. The production is nice, their voices sound great together, and the video is pretty cute. But maaaaaan those lyrics. Come on, Taylor! You're supposed to be our songwriting queen!

**FluffyNobody** (6): This song came out the day I defended my PhD thesis, and listening to it brings back the memories from that day, the nervousness, the joy, the craziness, everything. Probably deserves less, but my memories with it are so nice, I can't help but like it.

**Kromorei** (6): honestly better than the b sides

**RandomHypnotica** (6): This song gets WAAAYYY too much hate. It's not great, no, but it's certainly not the giant train wreck that it's often made out to be.

**skargardin** (6): i'm not gonna write another thinkpiece on this fucking song ever again

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): not as awful as some of you make it out to be. This isn’t good, and its way too generic, but the production is decent, and there are glimpses of Taylor’s songwriting skill that shine through here and there.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): cute but annoying [3]. Also I thought this would be my 0 but they removed “hey kids, spelling in fun” so this song doesn’t suck as much anymore

**axestogrind** (5): Don't know how to explain it but this is overhated but also not hated enough

**Bajuko** (5): Brendon Urie absolutely ruins this song

**cremeebrulee** (5): this song is going out first for sure so it doesn’t really matter what i give it lmfao

**frogaranaman** (5): the fact that this is one of the best songs on the album- 💀

**hunnybee12** (5): and that’s what you missed on GLEE!

**Jimmy345960** (5): Not as bad as Bad Blood but man I wish I saw what she saw in it. Cruel Summer is right here sis

**ManofOranges** (5): A part of me really wanted to give this song a 10, semi-ironically and semi-not. I think at some point I made the transition from liking this song in the ironic way to just actually liking. The reason it's not a 10 though is because of the sheer disappointment I remember feeling when it released. I watched the youtube video premiered and the entire time my jaw was dropped simply beause I could not believe that *this* is really what the lead single was, the song that was meant to clue me in to what the rest of the album was gonna be like. This song sunk any expectations I had for this album, and honestly I think it was the reason I did not like this album when it first came out as much as I do now.

**shesdoingyoga** (5): This one doesn’t deserve the amount of hate it gets but it’s still not good. Fun fact, this song is what made me realize I don’t like Brendon Urie’s voice and that’s part of why I don’t like it.

**valus** (5): any other song as a lead single would have been superior

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): It's really catchy, but the lyrics are just fine and I can’t stand the sound of the “me-hee-hee! hoo-hoo-hoo!”

**wasian-invasion** (5): honestly i don’t hate this one. Except the whole bridge yikes

**twat\_brained** (4.7): This song was such a gigantic letdown after going a full 18 months without a new Taylor Swift single. And honestly, Brendon doesn't really add anything of value here. The only real redemption for me here is the music video, and extra points for the YNTCD Easter egg, but even then it just further details the whole Sesame Street vibe of it all. Well, save for the obvious nod to The Beatles on Ed Sullivan in 1964. This time the year prior I was relishing Ariana's debut single and music video, also directed by Dave Meyers. I think it's time we stopped letting Dave Meyers direct music videos. More importantly, Taylor Swift and Brendon Urie are no longer teenagers. Hell, they're not even in their 20s anymore. Neither are their core audience.

**puberty1** (4.5): not even bottom 3 of the album but still not good

**Stryxen** (4.5): the silence where “spelling is fun” used to be is absolutely deafening and it lasts forever… anyways a kind of cute song but it's too easy to hate on and shouldn’t have been lead single

**1998tweety** (4): It's meh. Overhated but also not undeserving of some of the hate.

**Brendon-Urine** (4): brendon bb make good music again pls :(

**J\_Toe** (4): if you don't point out that spelling is fun, than are you really singing about Me?

**Nickl00** (4): the first chorus is actually pretty good but the rest isn’t

**rotating3Dtext** (4): god I remember waiting for taylor’s single to drop and then hearing this, with the video, and being like… wtf

**rsmitty99** (4): That bridge…yikes. Idk. This song just doesn't do it for me. Brendon has such a phenomenal voice. Kind of a waste. WHY WAS THIS THE FIRST SINGLE?? I remember watching her documentary on netflix and she's writing the song talking about how it's gonna be the first single and I'm screaming at the screen "BABY GURL NOOOOOOOO!!"

**waluigiest** (4): honestly I wanted to believe in this song more after watching Miss Americana. The potential is there, but the writing and orchestration are horrendous. This being the lead single really, really hurt this era’s critical potential.

**ladililn** (3.5): Did I consider giving this my zero? Absolutely. But then it came on shuffle and delivered an immediate dose of SPRING! It’s fun! It’s silly! it’s butterflies and rainbows! Then the bridge hits and we go from “bubblegum pop” to “kindergarten pop.” Can we talk about how the real crime isn't “spelling is fun” but “you can’t spell awesome without me”? Not only is the latter 10000x worse, but it gets REPEATED in the outro, so even that fan edit of the song without the bridge isn’t the safe space I require as a millennial snowflake.

**alwayswords** (3): M3!

**bulforster** (3): Aggressively basic.

**george\_kaito** (3): chile

**JanuaryFourteenth** (3): It’s the climax of a C-tier Broadway musical

**nick1372** (3): why did you have to play me hee hee like this Taylor

**rhyneston3** (3): You know after listening to the full album I finally understand why Taylor Swift fans are so angry at her single choices, 3 of the 5 singles from this album were the worst songs on the album

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (3): Much ink has been spilled over SPELLING IS FUN, we have only left to hope that TS8 will be without any grammar lessons from Taylor. What annoys me the most is Taylor's refusal to leave teen pop behind. She's the same as Rihanna and Adele, can you imagine?

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): bop

deleted: **Ghost-Quartet** (2): Nobody who gives this a good score is allowed to make fun of me for liking Meghan Trainor ever again.

**nootnoot781** (2): JAIL!

**PointlessBibliophage** (2): i actually liked this song way more when "spelling is fun" was still in it. to me, that was a commitment to the lighthearted childishness that made the song work. without it, i find the song void of anything that could make it interesting.

**PoppyPigglet** (2): this gets an ironic 2 for the fact that both people exist and -8 for the fact that they both decided this was a good lead single

**radiofan15** (2): I remember when the video of this song was about to premiere on YouTube and videocalled my BF (who hates Taylor BTW) to watch it with me because I wanted to see what she was gonna do this time... I had to apologize to him halfway through the video just because I felt so ashamed to having been excited for this...

**runaway3212** (2): I absolutely adore Lover but this song is truly amazingly bad

**TiltControls** (2): Getting rid of the 'Hey kids spelling fun' kills the song. If you're going for cheese you might as well go for the full platter

**vhqv1997** (2): Every single man involved in this song made it worse in execution than on paper, but it's not like the sheet was beautiful in the first place anyway. But at least she could have salvaged it with some proper hard-hitting production or a less emotionless featuring vocalist. That single first line was better than the entire song.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (1.5): We all know it's awful, but is catchy I'll give it that

**Agusarg** (1): Spelling sucks

**bespectacIed** (1): White ME!diocrity

**CarlieScion** (1): I own 2 copies of this song. On vinyl AND CD. Yes, not the album. But the song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): this is like a shitty kidz bop parody and deserves every instance of roasting it's ever gotten

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYiHbOCD8Vk&t=18s

**ggodisawomann** (1): also one of the worst songs in Taylor's discography. I wanted so much to like this and was hype for its release bc I LOVE Brendon Urie and Panic in general. hype for his vocals (which I still think are great on the song regardless of the other pieces I don't like about ME!), completely disappointed by this Kidz Bop trash.

**JMez2613** (1): I hope this song gets last place

**nooodisaster** (1): I will never get over the fact that when this was first leaked people thought it was going to be a single for a B-list animated kids movie.

**NotWith10000Men** (1): y'all… this song is garbo

**ReallyCreative** (1): Imagine all the promise of the opening vocal lick to give a reputation-style crone on the first verse. Imagine patching your song after it's released. She's a disaster, She's an embarassment, She's a Taylor Swift lead single.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): compare this to the other lead singles in here. these aoty nominated ladies cannot relate

**agentofscranton** (0): never have i ever been more hyped for a song, and never have i ever been so disappointed

**anothertown** (0): trash

**eeveefan01** (0): Hey Kids, low scores are fun

**Evanbrooks324** (0): one of the worst songs if not her worst song by taylor, the chorus makes me want to die inside

**hadea0090** (0): not even my 4 y/o sister likes it

**hawksband** (0): If you gave me a chance I would take it It's a shot in the dark but i'll make it

**jayjaysortagay** (0): absolutely not, this is the worst lead single from a pop girl ever. I wouldn't even put it on the deluxe version, horrible. It's a minor bop before BU comes in but then it's a drastic, unending dive.

**Johnnytoby** (0): I still remember hearing this the first time, I was so ashamed to be a pophead

**JunkyGS** (0): I not only dislike the song, but HATE what it represents, which is how this song single handedly derailed the entire era along with many people dismissing this album which features some of Taylor's best material.

[We can go drivin' on my scooter, uh, you know, just riding in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGT9jc86EqM)

Taylor Swift built a good chunk of her career writing about her tragic relationships, but now she’s in one that’s going pretty well, and she’s going to let us know how amazing it is to date her 6’ blue eyed, blonde god of a boyfriend. *London Boy* was very controversial, because it’s so bubblegum and cheesy that it’s almost camp, and you either love or hate it, there’s no inbetween. The one thing most people agree with is that you can’t take this song too seriously, you have to listen to this song acknowledging that it isn’t trying to be anything but a literal ball of joy, and a list of different places that you can only enjoy this much being a starry eyed, rich tourist in love. It does stick out sonically and most fans would probably cut this if they needed to make the album 14-15 tracks short ^(as it should be), but I guess having the cheesiest love song she has written on an album called *Lover* makes sense.

This song also marks the second time Taylor has [angered citizens of a place solely by talking overly positive about the city they live in.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7387659/Londoners-mock-Taylor-Swifts-new-song-London-Boy.html)

**LesApfels** (11): LONDON BOY STANS RISE UP

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Hated on for no! Reason! It's cute and catchy and I love it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Gays who love London Boy are definitely the ones who would quote tweet a white man's thirst trap with a GIF/video of Tamera Mowry saying "I get called a white man's whore". It's me, I am the gays.

**mms82** (8): honestly saved by Joe's into

**moooo566** (8): absolutely iconic, imagine being joe alwyn and your girlfriend writes a song about how much she loves how british you are, and when she needs a voice to really represent you she chooses idris elba, who is widely considered to be the most attractive british man

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This song is a bop, y’all are just rude

**nick1372** (8): This one is cute but I can never listen to it without thinking about that one Tumblr meme about wanting to live in Britain

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This one doesn’t deserve the hate it gets

**skargardin** (8): I'm not trying to argue for that this is some deep lyrical poetry or anything but it IS a damn fun time and I love every second of it

**vhqv1997** (8): I once made a remix of this song but I replace every "boy" with "BOI" spoken by Kratos from God of War

**wardrum5** (8): People hate fun

**cashewconstellation** (7.8): I don't care what y'all say, it's fun

**WeastofEden44** (7.8): I love this song don't @ me, but it still is objectively subpar

**avenueroy** (7.6): Okay, this kind of slaps

**Mysario** (7.6): fun-ish song but idk kinda meh lyrically

**twat\_brained** (7.5): it's silly but its a fun silly that's endearing

**1998tweety** (7): It's alright. Grew on me, but it's meh for the album standards. Still a cute bop.

**FluffyNobody** (7): It's cute and also a full rainbow of cringe, but considering how my whole personality has become "omg Greece" ever since I met my boyfriend, I cannot really blame her

**lilacsweetener** (7): Yeah it’s filler and repeats previous points made but it’s so charming. I love hearing how Joe changed her just by being himself. Also Idris Elba’s scooter is the only scooter I ever want to hear about.

**Stryxen** (7): ms Swift don’t frettun me wiv a gud toyme

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): kinda middle of the road but it's cute

**ladililn** (6.4): This is the kind of patented Taylor Swift “corny, but in a fun way!” song I vibe with.

**AnimationJava** (6): Taylor fetishizing British people? jk jk, a cute song.

**bespectacIed** (6): I unironically enjoy this lol. It's so cringey and patronizing that it HAS to be intentional.

**CarlieScion** (6): a song that is somehow more annoying than London as a city. Also who the fuck wants to go to camden

**eeveefan01** (6): Meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Every day I’m grateful that this came out after the *Sherlock*/*Dr. Who*/*Harry Potter*/*One Direction* fandoms quieted down so I’ll politely ignore the more grating elements of it.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): I find this annoying but I'd like it if it was a Kim Petras song so I'm giving it a "pity 6" to not be a hypocrite

**vayyiqra** (6): A truly bizarre song to hear coming from Miss Americana herself, here seen LARPing as Lily Allen. But it's not awful once you get past the instinct to laugh at first at how surreal it is that this song even exists.

**waluigiest** (6): this song is bad but I love it please don’t text

**wasian-invasion** (6): you didn’t need to make this an 18 song album

**bulforster** (5.5): As a proud Londoner, on the one hand I like knowing the places she references, but on the other this is very cringey.

**untutorable** (5.5): yeah it's fine

**anagalisgv** (5): this is petty but i HATE the way she says 'mine'

**Brendon-Urine** (5): Taylor's being horny on the main

**Kanne\_** (5): i don't really click with the lyrics but it's ok i guess

**ManofOranges** (5): There's a part of me that somewhat likes this song and there's a part of me that doesn't so this score is me splitting the difference. I think it's cute and at least parts of it are delicious to the ear, but I also think to the point of annoying. I basically don't like the first minute or minute and a half of this song at all. I have to wait til the end to really get something that I like.

**materialqirl** (5): forgettable

**Nickl00** (5): nah I’m good

**rsmitty99** (5): Eh. I think the London references are pretty surface level.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): the only thing more cringe than this song is me calling something cringe in 2020

**TiltControls** (5): It's fine? I guess?

**anothertown** (4): https://www.tiktok.com/@trader_giotto/video/6820815754024324358

**cleen\_claire** (4): I never want to hear Taylor say rugby again

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4): The Drag Race UK version of American Boy, where you take all the fun slang/stereotypes and ignore, you know, the actual culture.

**hockey\_newfoundland** (4): Looking at London on Google Maps gives you as much of an connection to London as this song

**JanuaryFourteenth** (4): This sounds like a cheap Halloween costume

**Johnnytoby** (4): man whyd the chorus do that

**ladywolvs** (4): the lyrics make me c r i n g e but the beat is ok

**mayolizard** (4): hmm… thinking… many thoughts

**strangergravityfalls** (4): upping this because i live in a london

**franch** (3): this is like the worst aspects of bubblegum pop. i can't deal with it. the lyrics are too bad and not in a cute saccharine way. the music is cutesy in a fun way, i wish i didn't hate this.

**frogaranaman** (3): most of dis album sounds da same, lit rally luv xx

**hadea0090** (3): The production slaps but those lyrics are not it.

**ignitethephoenix** (3): cute (although less cute) but annoying [2]

**kappyko** (3): this entire album is a case of melodic deja vu and a contest between jack antonoff and joel little to see who can flanderize their production style more

**puberty1** (3): ive come around to this song not being the worst but london queen by charli is still better

**rotating3Dtext** (3): HAHAHAHAHA

**static\_int\_husp** (3): "We can go driving in, on my scooter" is my signal usually to turn this album off. Truly the point where this album transitions from one of the best of last year to one of the worst.

**Kromorei** (2): i don't think anyone likes this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): American Boy outsold

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (2): What was she thinking? She sounds about 10 years old on this song. I would also like to say that refering to your SO as "baby boy" is a big fat no.

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (2): belongs on a straight to dvd nickelodeon original

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.4): London boys sweeties I'm so sorry

**akanewasright** (1): I like some of the early lyrics... but Jesus Christ. The hook is repellent, and this is coming from someone who likes Ari’s make up. This is the song that cements Antonoff as the best collaborator on the album. Frank Dukes and crew made some great songs on the album, but this one is so bad that it tarnishes their overall collaboration with Taylor.

**animefangrant62** (1): (Revolting.)

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): No.

**fadedblue09** (1): Great, another zero contender. Awful lyrics, trash production, literally irredeemable. All the hate energy you guys are giving towards ME! and You Need to Calm Down should be directed here. I guess she needs to release this as a single for you to realize how bad this is, huh?

**ImADudeDuh** (1): how do you do, fellow brits?

**nooodisaster** (1): As Stiles Stilinski once said: "No. You want that in Spanish? ¡No!

**pearllouise** (1): Taylor sounds like a rejected Cock Destroyer

**radiofan15** (1): Imma write a song about falling in love with a mythical Icelandic centaur... I know they don't exist and I have never visited Iceland, but if Taylor can get away with writing about London with the bare minimum knowledge of the country/culture and doing such a terrible job with it then I can do the same!

**wavingwolves** (1): people really let her write this, release it AND involve idris elba. as a fan, i don't know if i'll ever forgive her. also, this is a hundred times worse than me!

**Agusarg** (0): Maybe some songs didn't need to be on the album

**Awkward\_King** (0): fuck this fucking song

**axestogrind** (0): There's nothing redeemable about this, it's not self-aware enough to be satire, it's not cutesy enough to be likeable, it's not witty enough to be funny, the production does nothing. One of her worst ever.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (0): I've listened to this album soooo many times and I still couldn't tell you how this song goes. I don't care for it at all. If she disowned it tomorrow and took it off all streaming services, I wouldn't care. Plus doesn't she already have like 8 other songs about fetishizing her having a foreign boyfriend? And who the fuck is Stella McCartney? 

**jackisboredtoday** (0): Honestly I’ve only heard this like twice because it immediately stood out as a skip and one of Taylor’s worst ever songs

**ReallyCreative** (0): Truly awful, I have no idea why this song is here but it makes 0 sense appearing on the album in this order or really at all. ME! at least has that opening vocal chord thing but I enjoy 0 things about this song. We are literaly one reference to her visiting England on a high school field trip/family vacation or something away from the most unholy combination of Swiftisms.

*8* was destined to be the first Billie song out from the beginning, being quite reminiscent of one of her [older songs that also got ^underservely rated poorly](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8rl4fs/2017_ep_rate_day_2_and_the_award_for_biggest/e0s9odo/). Although it being a nice, soothing tune, it was received very poorly because of the very confusing decision to distort Billie’s vocals to make them sound like an actual toddler, making this song a lot less pleasant to listen to and distracts from the heartbreaking lyrics. This song overall feels like an attempt to bridge *ocean eyes* Billie with *bad guy* Billie, but ends up landing in a weird limbo in between both that doesn’t work the way it wants to.

Want a tip to enjoy this song a lot more? [Listen to this live version she did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-oOEV1jfeM), and pretend this was released in the *dont smile at me* EP.
---

**bandnitos** (10): i love the pitch shifting tbh

**runaway3212** (10): Truly amazing

**radiofan15** (9.7): is this death bed (coffee for your head)?

**jayjaysortagay** (9): super cute

**rhyneston3** (9): There's just so many interesting production decisions made on this album, I'm so into it

**puberty1** (8.5): this song is most likely the first one out and i can understand people not being here for the the ukulele + baby voice combo but i actually really like it

**slazenger7** (8.2): This is as close as she comes to changing things up sonically, and it's VERY welcome.

**akanewasright** (8): This song never made much of an impression on me aside from the pitch shifting, but honestly... it’s a pretty cool track.

**alwayswords** (8): overhated

**cashewconstellation** (8): It's unusual but I like it!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Eight!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): The song's production kinda reminds me of her earlier songs "party favor", with some interesting experimentation on the production, especially on Billie's vocals.

**eeveefan01** (8): it just feels natural to give it this score

**Evanbrooks324** (8): i mean do I need to say anything

**Kanne\_** (8): i like the baby voice, sue me

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): haha GET IT?

**nootnoot781** (8): eight

**pearllouise** (8): see what I did there?

**PointlessBibliophage** (8): well it definitely is an 8

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): (eight)

**TiltControls** (8): going for the easy score here (though I think this actually the right score - great, but not as remarkable as her other songs)

**vayyiqra** (8): :banana: :avocado:

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.9): Don't love the baby voice, but I like how it gets mature as the song develops. I'm a fool for ukeleles.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): this song's evidently filler but I wish she'd performed this on her When We All Fall Asleep tour instead of listen before I go

**AnimationJava** (7.5): While the baby voice is a bit weird, I'm a sucker for Billie ukelele songs.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This song is cute, wish I knew what it was about

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): i don't really get the point of the high pitched vocals, it just takes away from the song

**fadedblue09** (7.3): Gets points for picking a unique instrument that gives a much-needed change of pace, but that baby-sounding voice is weirdly grating.

**cleen\_claire** (7): not a fan the baby voice but everything else is art

**CritneySpearz** (7): honestly minus the baby voice parts, it’s rly good

**FluffyNobody** (7): the ukulele reminds me of party favour, which is the superior song

**hadea0090** (7): so overhated. The baby voice doesn't bother me at all I actually think it's cute and creative.

**hawksband** (7): not quite an eight

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Damn, that baby voice at the beginning is weird

**moooo566** (7): really wish this was one point better

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This would be the most forgettable song on the album if it weren’t for the different voice she does

**Tedyonce** (7): i know people will hate this but its pretty

**waluigiest** (7): cute lil uke, she has quite the range

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): once you get past the bad high pitch voice in the beginning, this is actually ok. But every time I hear the start I skip the entire song. I wish she didn’t do that ugh

**plantp0wer** (6.5): I don’t really like the high-pitched parts but it’s cute

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6.4): This song is weird but I honestly kind of enjoy it. The melody is actually excellent, if you can look past the baby voice

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): Not really digging the baby voice. A weird song overall.

**kappyko** (6): extra point because they used this in some weird anti-bullying thing they showed at my school lmfao

**lapascalia** (6): I don’t hate it, but I don’t enjoy it that much either. Wish I could give it an 8.

**mayolizard** (6): the bitches who give this an eight just cuz da title….

**rsmitty99** (6): Is she eight in this recording? What am I listening to? I'm uncomfortable.

**Stryxen** (6): this track gets completely outsold by the rest of the album - she deserves better ):

**untutorable** (6): cute but not gorgeous

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): the baby voice at the start… playboi carti is shaking

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): this song kinda creeps me out and I get that creepiness is a little bit of Billie's thing but the baby vocals I'm just not a fan of.

**anothertown** (5): the voice changing just doesn’t work but the song is cute

**leviswift13** (5): her voice gave me a panic attack the first time i listened.

**ManofOranges** (5): I for real like remember very little about this song.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (5): i'm really conflicted on this

**rotating3Dtext** (5): sorry I’m not into ukeleles

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): I have no idea what this song is doing here or what Billie even wanted to achieve, but it's interesting and I don't hate it

**WeastofEden44** (5): No.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (4.5): really not a fan of that baby voice

**CarlieScion** (4): more like a 0.8 haha am I right fellas

**frogaranaman** (4): musical.ly teas

**ggodisawomann** (4): no

**JanuaryFourteenth** (4): I’m sorry y’all it’s just not an 8

**nooodisaster** (4): The baby voice needs to S T O P.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): Why did she nightcore her own song

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (4): an album with 6 singles, it is shocking to no one that this song didn't make the cut

**Johnnytoby** (3.8): thought I'd give it an eight for the memes but this sucks

**george\_kaito** (3): why does she sound like a frog

**ImADudeDuh** (3): whew chile, anyways

**vhqv1997** (3): 8 by bon iver outsold entirely

**cyborglilith** (2): i sleep

**Mysario** (1.8): i need an eight-ball to get through this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1.8): when the teacher asks how many sides an octagon has

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): ffs this baby voiced bitch stop it

**animefangrant62** (1): (Why?)

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Thank you, Billie, for making sure that Lizzo gets my highest average.

**Nickl00** (0): nah I’ve heard this song once and I still remember how much I hate it even after a year

**NotWith10000Men** (0): billie whyyyyyyy

**skargardin** (0): I simply can't listen to this. between the baby vocals, the way too prominent bass and billie's delivery, this is an all around mess

**ManofOranges** (8): [Ok I would like to say that I think Billie definitely](/spoiler) deserved [every grammy that she got. Whether someone](/spoiler) deserved [something more is another question entirely but I at least think that bad guy, her album, etc. all merited getting an award in there own right.](/spoiler)

**bespectacIed** (5): [It IS](/spoiler) undeserved [but it's kinda not her fault. Grammys are a racist, tasteless organization. But yeah she deserved SOTY ... maybe BNA (but lizzo deserved more)](/spoiler)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): [she](/spoiler) deserved[ best new artist and arguably song of the year, record of the year shouldve been old town road and honestly idc who would've won aoty as long as it wasn't lil nas x's ep or lana's overhyped as all shit snoozefest. i was mad at the time of her sweeping but after actually listening to the album in full it was completely fair to give it to her, even if i liked lizzo's more overall.](/spoiler)

**1998tweety** (3): [ok she](/spoiler) deserved [1 or 2 of those but NFR was robbed](/spoiler)

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (3): [I'm not going to lie, I don't think she](/spoiler) deserved [to sweep. But there's no use making a huge thing out of it and there's really no point in indulging Stan Twitter enough to act like this was really that big of a deal either.](/spoiler)

But to use that argument as the basis that she doesn't](/spoiler) deserve [to win her Grammys is very harsh and I feel so sorry for her. She didn't even want to win just for the backlash alone.

**hadea0090** (3): [she](/spoiler) deserved [AOTY idc, SOTY tho? I could see that](/spoiler)

**ImAMessyBitchDuh** (1): [erm, she did](/spoiler) deserve [every award. Stay delusional lana fans who that she somehow had a shot to win even though she was LITERALLY NOT EVEN BOOKED TO PERFORM ANYTHING AND ONLY HAD 2 NOMINATIONS AND ARRIVED TO THE GRAMMYS IN A DRESS SHE BOUGHT AT THE MALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!](/spoiler)

**wavingwolves** (1): [people who think she didn't](/spoiler) deserve [it are lying to themselves. the blacklash she got was definitely undeserved, tho](/spoiler)

**twat\_brained** (0): [Billie is not to blame for winning all her Grammys. She completely](/spoiler) deserves [them. The Recording Academy is the one at fault here for only focusing on her and not spreading out their Grammys across more artists. I stopped valuing Grammys when Meghan won Best New Artist over Tori Kelly. My distrust was cemented in Lorde's Album of the Year loss to 24K Magic. None of it is Billie's responsibility.](/spoiler)


#maybe if the others stanned loona they would have won

**letsallpoo** (10): lana tried it

**RosaPalms** (9): justice for "Old Town Road"

**Tolk1en** (7): I was too emotionally involved, supporting Ariana, I was screaming "Ariana robbed". This controversy was only battles of stans, no big personnalities involved in this to be interesting. 2 bonus point for Billie saying on stage that Ariana deserved it

**WeastofEden44** (4): Boring and Lana for AOTY (WWAFAWDWG still good tho)

jackisboredtoday: true, but if we are considering the biggest villain to be the song with the most resources and the morally incorrect stances then an even bigger villain than Cruel Summer would have to be 7 Rings, the morally questionable song which went #1 on Billboard with endless publicity, resources and maybe the most streams from the GP of anything in this rate, and I think it'll be the one people most celebrate when its eliminated (and the one people get angriest to see last beyond day 1). It isn't a favorite to win the rate but it may be the song which is the biggest villain nonetheless. Cruel Summer could definitely be a secondary villain in this case tho

runaway3212: IMO, 7 rings is the Cersei Lannister while Cruel Summer is the Littlefinger.  Sure the first one is the more obvious villain, but the second sneaks up on you, you don’t see it until it’s too late. The first you see coming from a mile away and you burn down with your dragons.

In usual Taylor Swift fashion, her lead single, *ME!*, had the entire internet arguing about her, but little did we know that was only the beginning, because with no warning, as soon as pride celebrations started taking place, she called every recognizable queer artist she had in her contacts and said *Gay Right!™*. If you’re in this sub, there’s no need to re-explain the entire discourse surrounding this song, because it is a very extensive and difficult topic to tackle and there’s many factors to have in mind when discussing celebrities showing support to certain causes and how we react to them, but I think a good point to conclude with in this particular case is that Taylor should probably have voiced her support of the LGBTQ  community before and “coming out” as an ally now when it’s more accepted than ever before does feel like a calculated move, but at the same time, it doesn’t hurt anyone and it is appreciated to have one of the most famous pop stars pushing so openly for the Equality Act and spreading the message of the song uncensored to other nations where acceptance of the queer community is more scarce.

The existence of *You Need To Calm Down* was full of good intention, but it needed careful work in the lyric department to make sure it had a better execution, which is a shame, because the harmonies and productions in the chorus is just DIVINE.

---

**fadedblue09** (10): Overhated bop. This isn’t even inflation. Despite the pandering lyrics, it has a fun sing-along hook with uplifting production. Popheads won’t acknowledge a good bop until it hits them hard in the head.

**HolyGroundTS** (10): She said Gay Rights

**Jimmy345960** (10): So, This song. I hear its hatred. I get it. Sometimes celebrities pretend to like a cause for clout and money. Cool. But this song inspired me so much. Sure, shes clunky. But, to have a message as pro-lgbt to me is wonderful. This song was on top 40 radio for MONTHS in the United States. Yes, "shade never made anyone less gay" is not the show stopping line that she wanted it to be but I like it. I like the positive representation this song gives me. I live in the most red political areas of new york and it feels wonderful to turn my speakers to their max and listen to this song just blast. I like how this song makes me feel accepted when I feel distraught.

**ManofOranges** (10): I would like to say that I don't think this song is good but that isn't gonna stop me from at least enjoying it. It's almost a guilty pleasure except I really don't feel guilty about it.

**Mysario** (9.9): filthy bop

**franch** (9.3): the haters need to calm down

**Awkward\_King** (9): i honestly love it and i am so so sorry for that

**eeveefan01** (9): I Bop to this, haters need to calm down

**george\_kaito** (9): seeing taylor, who is one of my favourite artists of all time, be an ally literally makes me cry. anyways i cant help but sing along when this comes up, its such a bop

**Johnnytoby** (9): lol its catchy haters

**Kromorei** (9): unironically one of the best songs on the album

**leviswift13** (9): i'm sorry, i love this song. would've been a great first single. i don't get why people don't like it. it's so fun and boppy and sassy. i feel like its the optimism of shake it off pared with the real world cyncism of look what you made me do. and she's right; shade NEVER made anybody less gay!!!

**Nickl00** (9): the lyrics are on par with the man but the production and her harmonies and absolutely amazing

**TiltControls** (9): Great song, but Taylor - the lyrics here are not as clever as you think they are

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8.8): this song had a lot of replay value for me - i think i just really love those "uh oh uh oh uh ohhhhhs". the placing of it in the album is clunky however

**mayolizard** (8.5): i don't like the lyrics even as a home of sexual but. hmm.

**cashewconstellation** (8.4): It's a bop

**anagalisgv** (8): this is such a guilty pleasure song of mine

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): Wish it was longer and I wish she spent at least another day or two on the lyrics but it's good to me.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is definitely the song that will go out on Day One and it's understandable since this is one of the weaker songs of the album. I guess I am one of the few that really likes You Need to Calm Down still. It fits with the summer vibe, especially since Pride falls in June. I really think the controversy behind the song is really lame since Taylor is genuinely bringing awareness to the community. Perhaps, it seems like a cute attempt compared to other pop stars like Lady Gaga who went hardcore with their support. But considering Taylor is a huge pop star worldwide, her support for the LGBTQ+ community may be assuring for gay Swifties in countries where they could actually be killed for their existence. It was even #1 on iTunes in countries with homophobic laws! The fact she performed the song without censoring the lyrics in China is a huge statement.

**kappyko** (8): i fucking hate the music video and want it permanently erased from the internet but this is the only song on the album that i can listen to and be like... yeah this is fun. it's activism as performance and i actively disdain why this exists but as a song it's very good. those harmonies are just killer. but listen to K.Flay's "Sister" instead. or Conan Gray's "The King."

**lapascalia** (8): I think this should have been the first single, if she really didn’t want to use Cruel Summer.

**nooodisaster** (8): Okay you know what!! I like this song. The beat is groovy, it's catchy, the lyrics are basic 2010 pride but still are cute, and compared to ME! this is The Hallelujah Chorus.

**RosaPalms** (8): those "oh-ohs" on the chorus are responsible for at least three of these points

**runaway3212** (8): It's not amazing, but the 'oh oh oh oh' is really good.

**wardrum5** (8): No song last year was debated more than this one and I'm still exhausted from it, but the song's catchy because it has the same beat as Sunflower

**avenueroy** (7.9): Should Taylor Swift have been more open about her political views earlier in her career? Yeah, probably. Is Taylor Swift the straightest woman alive? Absolutely. Is "'cause shade never made anybody less gay" one of the stupidest lyrics I've ever heard? Yep. But is it a bop and a half? Oh, 100%. Nearly a year after this song's release, I've finally come to terms with loving it.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): Perfect for a summer single (more so than Cruel Summer, fight me) but the Patrón line makes me cringe

**rickikardashian** (7.7): i actively ignore the lyrics of the song to enjoy this song:)

**radiofan15** (7.5): It's the musical equivalent of a bank having a float in a pride parade BUT it's also just catchy and bubbly enough to outright hate...

**WeastofEden44** (7.5): It's not...great but it was a MOMENT and the mv was a complete serve and I still enjoy the song for what it is.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): i hated this at first but thanks to working at target it's grown on me after hearing it a million times

**Anthony-Vince** (7): Cute bop that I feel people are a bit too hard on. That being said it's obviously not one of her best.

**bespectacIed** (7): The most blatant ripoff of The Knife - Heartbeats, if I were them I would have sued Miss Taylor "See You In Court" Suewift. BUT does that stop this song from being a bop? No.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): I've got nothing profound to say. This bops

**FluffyNobody** (7): I unapologetically like this song, sue me

**hikkaru** (7): will pride be cancelled because of coronavirus or because people fear having to hear this

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7): Taylor said gay rights about ten years too late

**ladililn** (7): Honestly? A bop.

**meiscool132** (7): I liked it better before having all of these other songs to compare it to, in classic TS singles fashion

**mms82** (7): listen to the clean bandit remix, so much better and would be a solid 10 and a contender for my 11

**rsmitty99** (7): When Taylor released this song and video, a lot of people liked to write hit pieces saying that the song just scratches the surface and it fails to do much for the LGBT community. There was also complaints that we didn't need a straight white woman to speak for us. But I always felt like this was a very nice gesture from someone who was fairly silent for over a decade. Plus she pushed hard for the equality act. Honestly, all of this is neither here nor there. How good is the song? It's fine.

**waluigiest** (7): I love Ribs by Lorde!

deleted: **1998tweety** (6.5): I really don't wanna type up an essay for this and I definitely don't wanna start this whole discourse again so imma just link what I already wrote on this song a year ago for the jukebox.

**AnimationJava** (6.5): I liked the song a lot when it first came out but it aged kinda like milk for me tbh.

**LesApfels** (6.5): Clean Bandit Remix outsold

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): i mean she made some points and my gay ass still bops to this song but yeah it is not that great

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6.4): Some of the lyrics are cringey, but I like what she does rhythmically here and it succeeds as being a catchy anthem

**akanewasright** (6): I can’t hate it. It’s shallow and stupid, but I love that beat. Plus... her allyship is pretty genuine. It got a lot of shit when the track dropped, but she’s not just cashing in on the pride trend.

**frogaranaman** (6): https://i.imgur.com/ytD6iLf.png

**J\_Toe** (6): sonically, it almost sounds like LCD Soundsystem. That's all I'm gonna talk about.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): production=10 lyrics=2 average is 6

**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): sigh. thinking about this song makes me tired. yeah i agree that calling homophobia "shade" and putting it on the same level as annoying twitter haters and stans is questionable as fuck. is it really that problematic? maybe, idk. how ironic that a song called "You Need to Calm Down" is so controversial. this shit is still catchy though

**rotating3Dtext** (6): ...I think she genuinely tried

**wavingwolves** (6): i actually like this song but i remember that when i first listened to this i couldn't tell if the "shade never made anybody less gay" line was homophobic or not

**wasian-invasion** (5.5): putting aside alllll the issues with the song, the oh ohs are super catchy

**Agusarg** (5): Thank god the production's good at least

**bandnitos** (5): and we'll never be royals

**moooo566** (5): appreciate the intention but its not a good song

**nick1372** (5): I appreciate the effort Taylor, but the fact that I had to listen to this god awful song even once in my life is homophobia. Only thing that saves it is that clutch Joel Little beat. That man single handedly changed pop music and he deserves better than this.

**patcheso8** (5): Lyrics are simply atrocious

**plastichaxan** (5): shade never made anybody less gay but this song did make me less gay

**ReallyCreative** (5): Taylor says she's an ally and then uses the word shade like that, actions will tell on you girl

**static\_int\_husp** (5): The musical equivalent of a Bank of America float in a Pride Parade.

**vayyiqra** (5): Hey, hey, hey! Just think, while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world, you could've been getting down to THIS - SICK - BEAT.

**Austine567** (4): taylor no

**CarlieScion** (4): this is awful. Not as awful as me! but still low-key awful. Very heavy-handed and it sounds like it belongs in like. Idk a children’s movie from 2016

**NotWith10000Men** (4): so fucking tired of this song

**puberty1** (4): one of those songs that I would've probably loved when I was younger and couldn't understand english. i guess being bilingual sucks

**rhyneston3** (4): These singles were not the best choice

**skargardin** (4): lord knows why I looped this last summer

**twat\_brained** (4): I've been calm for much longer than Taylor has. It's hard for me to stay calm when the world's dictators are all willfully misinforming and endangering their publics' wellbeing regarding a worldwide pandemic. As a bisexual man, I don't need this patronization.

**untutorable** (4): we all make choices..... but that was a choice

**plantp0wer** (3.5): so corny I can’t, also it gave swifties a phrase to use anytime someone says anything slightly less than positive

**agentofscranton** (3): the only thing offensive about this song is how boring it is

**bulforster** (3): Petition for Taylor to stop using "shade" in her lyrics.

**cleen\_claire** (3): Very brave of Taylor to support the gays in 2019 with one single verse

**Evanbrooks324** (3): , shouldve left this off the album tay tay

**gannade** (3): it kinda grew on me but its also annoying

**lilacsweetener** (3): I enjoyed it while it was hot but I don’t revisit it.

**pearllouise** (3): "Hey Royals, can I copy your homework?" "Yeah just change it up a bit so it looks like you didn't copy it."

**TragicKingdom1** (3): did we really need another Taylor Swift vs. The Haters song, let alone another single with the same concept

**alwayswords** (2): the lyrics make me cringe

**hockey\_newfoundland** (2): Stream Equal Rights (Not Gay) by Connor 4 Real

**ladywolvs** (2): i hate this song but the beat is okay but the rest of it is so awful it still gets a 2

**anothertown** (1): shade never made anybody less gay

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kaTDKDaj2M&t=367s

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I don’t need to talk about how this song is crap, or how much I hate that it spawned so much public discourse over whether or not the LGBT+ community needed to lick the boots of a white pop star finally declaring that “gay is okay” in the most exploitative way possible 10+ years into her career/3+ years into the Trump presidency, or how it’s terribly ironic that Taylor is trying to act unbothered when a huge portion of her celebrity has been built around her releasing very not calm songs and very expensive music videos about “haters” so instead I’ll just ask am I the only one who thinks that the instrumental sounds exactly like “Too Much” by Carly Rae Jepsen? I always think that’s about to play whenever I hear this start.

**hadea0090** (1): :vomit:

**ignitethephoenix** (1): This song is way worse than I remember it being. And for that I have to kick it down a few more points then I was originally going to score it. I think it would have been better if it was just slightly faster but wow she is literally just talking throughout the entire song.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): how do you do, fellow home of sexuals?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): “Shade Never Made anybody less gay” is the worst lyric in Taylor’s entire career.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this sucks, stream LGBT by cupcakke instead

**vhqv1997** (1): I'll just quote Pitchfork here because they are absolutely correct in their assessment of the song: "The words are penned with the energy of a nail-painting emoji and delivered with a plastic smile."

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (1): the fact that we have to let her know that internet hate isn't the same as homophobia i-

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): The abysmal writing alone should be enough to warrant this score, but it is truly remarkable just how tonedeaf the overall message here really is, especially coming from someone as smart, calculated and pro-LGBTQ as Taylor. If you suggest that I'm holding Taylor to an unnecessarily high standard for this, you would probably be right, but if the only effect this song has on my perception of her is... giving her a 0 in this rate, then is it really that important?

**ggodisawomann** (0): one of the worst songs in her entire discography and the fact that ANYONE stans it...appalling and disgusting

**hunnybee12** (0): why didn’t someone tell her...

**Stryxen** (0): there are some redeeming qualities, but I just don’t want to talk about this song anymore. stream Rich White Straight Men by Kesha

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): what an absolute dumpster fire of a song

“Where my make up stans at?” Not here apparently.

*make up* while not being as controversial as other songs Ariana in this rate, ended up being considered the weakest of the album, mostly for the repetitive and simple beat, and lyrics that try to be clever but don’t really succeed at it. The *highlights* ^wink of this song seem to be the Fenty Beauty name drop and “*issa mood issa vibe*”, but besides those, the song doesn’t have much going on for it, causing it to get overshadowed by much stronger songs (Ariana really did this song wrong by sandwiching it in the middle of *bad idea* and *ghostin*)
---

**DaHumanTorch** (11): my favorite ariana song. i know this is a hot take, i know most people hate this song but i just love everything about it. the lyrics with the witty punchlines, the production, just everything about it is so fun. i know this will go out within like the first 5 songs and is sorta a wasted 11 but idc idc, hopefully this will bump it up a place or two

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The lyrics are hella corny but this is still a BOP. This is going out at Day One so I am giving this my pity 10.

**fadedblue09** (10): Watch this get robbed even though there it's better than half of the album.

**lapascalia** (10): Totally underrated on this album.

**waluigiest** (10): WHERE MY MAKE UP STANS AT???

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (9.2): this is just such a cute little bop

**Anthony-Vince** (9): Honestly super underrated, I love the word play and the instrumental is super addicting

**george\_kaito** (9): outsold fenty beauty

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): I’m not entirely sold on the beat but my first instinct says yes so I’ll go with it

**franch** (8.5): it's good but something about this is just mid-album filler. tragedy of being on such a stacked album, something has to be the weak point.

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): Same thing as with Fake Smile, this SLAPPED when I saw her live

**bbfan132** (8): short but cute!!

**nick1372** (8): this one deserved better

**akanewasright** (7.5): I don’t think I like this song... but I find it very effective. It feels gross, and that’s kinda the point.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I have always thought this sounds like a Rihanna-lite (probably cause she name drops Fenty) song but it’s no where as bad as people make it out to be. But it’s bottom tier on the album for sure

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): the weakest song in the album i think, and still a bop

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.1): Meh

**alwayswords** (7): overhated

**cashewconstellation** (7): It's nice

**eeveefan01** (7): a cute song, but thats it

**Nickl00** (7): I think it gets too much hate but it’s also the most forgettable track

**rsmitty99** (7): Ari loves layered vocals and harmonies. And it's ALL OVER this song. Kind of over kill. I always skipped this song. But relistening to this song after all this time, it really isn't as bad as I remembered.

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I did not like this one on first listen but it has grown on me a bit

**wasian-invasion** (7): eh the filler-iest song on the album

**Mysario** (6.7): this song stresses me out

**FluffyNobody** (6.5): The problem with the songs in this album is that the trap beat imo did not age well, and they sound incredibly repetitive. I hate the "yeah yeah yeah" in the chorus with every fibre of my being

**bespectacIed** (6): Ariana in k, bye for now: Where my makeup stans at? Crowd: crickets

**bulforster** (6): It's okay but sounds disjointed or unfinished somehow.

**ggodisawomann** (6): not as bad as people say, but bottom tier on this album!

**jackisboredtoday** (6): yaaaas ari promote my avon queen in the most boring song on your album

**meiscool132** (6): its sort of annoying to me, and rhyming 'make up' with 'make up' gets kinda old for me

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): ...ok Ariana maybe you should ease up on the AAVE

**ReallyCreative** (6): The disjointed beat is interesting, and the harmonic vocals are good, but it feels like a gimmick of a track

**vayyiqra** (6): It’s kind of masochistic. ‘Cause it’s like “ooh yeah we’re fighting and it’s hot”. I hate it. But I love it. :flush:

**vhqv1997** (6): Okay I'm genuinely curious, is Fenty Beauty actually that amazing? Cause I think I can understand why Rihanna would want to stop making music and focus on makeup instead. All the more power to her

**wavingwolves** (6): a mood a vibe a look a match

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): the fact that make up, the worst song on the album, is directly after the 3 best songs on the album is just…um…

**anagalisgv** (5): the beat throws me off every time

**anothertown** (5): wow I really hate those backbeats that are just off-beat enough and make the whole thing sound distorted?

**axestogrind** (5): Can't say it's bad but I already forgot how it goes and I'm currently listening to it

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (5): The production on this one sucks. Lyrics are pretty flat.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Pretty boring.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Severely undercooked. Could've been an album highlight otherwise.

**Evanbrooks324** (5): why was this on the album sis

**jayjaysortagay** (5): I don't like the production, it's very cheap sounding and nothing else is special about this.

**Kanne\_** (5): meh

**leviswift13** (5): i cannot conceptualize why this exists

**nooodisaster** (5): The best part of this is the Fenty Beauty name drop. Ari's live performance is amazing too, you can tell she loves this song. But you know what they say about her taste in her own music.... Yeaaaa.....

**NotWith10000Men** (5): this song is just boring. Not about that product placement either

**pearllouise** (5): meh

**rhyneston3** (5): Oof this seems like a misstep... still not bad though, if this is the worst song on the album then that's pretty impressive

**runaway3212** (5): The chorus rhymes make up with make up and that really ruines the song for me.

**Stryxen** (5): come on… do something else

**valus** (5): worst song on the album, stream yikes!

**twat\_brained** (4.8): "issa vibe" issa lousy vibe. it doesn't work as well as you think. not as an entire album.

**hadea0090** (4): everytime I go to rate it, I forget how it goes...

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (4): A dark spot on an otherwise very strong album. The double entendre with "make up" looks clever on paper, but sounds stupid on the album itself.

**radiofan15** (3.2): "Why does everyone hates this one so much?" [2 AND A HALF MINUTES LATER] "Oooo... ewww"

**1998tweety** (3): This is the kind of song only delusional Ari stans will gag over, sorry! Thoroughly mediocre and forgettable.

**CarlieScion** (3): this both sucks and has been done a million times before

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): It feels like everybody universally agreed that this song was a waste of space, I’m actually interested to see who gives it a good score.

**plantp0wer** (3): doesn’t do much idk

**skargardin** (3): this is just a bunch of white noise except for the "issa mood, issa vibe.." part

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): Repetitive, not memorable

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (3): the low points of the album are few but damn they are low, the fenty beauty shoutout is cute tho

**kappyko** (2): it dissipates

**AlbinoAbsol** (1): This is just a really bad idea for Ariana to have in between bad idea and ghostin.

**Johnnytoby** (1): a waste of two minutes wth

**lilacsweetener** (1): nope

**ManofOranges** (1): This is the one song on this album that is a complete miss for me. I don't really like anything about this song. I skip it every single time it comes on.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): it begins with the needy noise which is already a horrible start, and overall it's just uninteresting

**RandomHypnotica** (1): i'm sure someone out there likes make up. i'm sure someone out there is a sadist.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): WHY DOES THE BEAT SOUND LIKE THAT

**bandnitos** (0): no

**Kromorei** (0): this song is genuine dogshit.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Best song in the rate periodt, this deserved more.

**agentofscranton** (10): i think toddintheshadows said everything i wanted to say about this song best in his vid. if this truly is katy's last big-ish hit, then i'm glad she's going out on one of the biggest highs of her career.

**anagalisgv** (10): queen of summery vibes!

**AnimationJava** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**avenueroy** (10): This would get my 11 if I was allowed to give it to bonus songs. Perfect song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): Unfortunately I think it’s time to admit that Katy Perry isn’t a main pop girl anymore:(

**axestogrind** (10): let us rate Small Talk and Harleys in Hawaiis you commies

**Mysario** (9.9): except your career hue hue hue

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Harleys in Hawaii is still better than this. This is the hill i have decided to die on.

**wardrum5** (9.5): It's no "Small Talk" but it is pretty good

**rsmitty99** (9.4): What a fun. Poor Katy. She had such a great run at the top. And so far since witness, she's been releasing bop after bop. But who knows. Her career isn't really over. HA! I'll see myself out…

**CritneySpearz** (9): well it’s (this rate) over...

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Oh my God I feel so sad that this is the only Katy song in the rate. Man, we could have an era and an album with this song. This is Katy at her most confident after a messy roll-out with Witness. I am definitely surprised this was produced by Zedd but I should have known because of the ticking clocks here.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): bop a bit

**jayjaysortagay** (9): Katy girl, what are you doing. This is gold. Where is the whole album of this stuff. I love Harleys too, give me more of that.

**franch** (7): lol this kind of slaps

**nick1372** (7): I applaud Katy for trying but I cannot fucking get over "I can't even go on the internet / Without even searching your name." Please just stream Love You Like That, it's better in every single way.

**Stryxen** (7): like it’s fine but people on here seem to like this wayyyy too much idk maybe I just have no taste

**puberty1** (6.5): 365 outsold

Billie closed up her album with *goodbye*, a slow track that features lyrics from all the tracks. It’s pretty pleasing and closes up the album nicely, but it has not much going on for it besides “aye, we said these lyrics before, do you remember that?”. [Unless you are Intro by Ariana Grande](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dnemjwo/), any interlude, intro or outro is destined to get out Day 1, and this was never going to be an exception.

---

**Raykel** (11): i know its going out first idc it deserves someone to love it

**bandnitos** (10): this is such a good outro for the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m a theatre boy so you know I LOVE a reprise and a medley. What a fun way to close the album and thank the audience for listening to it, plus listening to this you find yourself going “oh yeah, remember that song?” and then going back to it.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this song is the reason Pop Danthology has retired

**PoppyPigglet** (10): I LOVE when a song interpolates previous album elements into a song.

**runaway3212** (10): We need more good closers on albums

**radiofan15** (9.5): Poppy and Kendrick did it better but still... HER MIND

**1998tweety** (9): Okay I'll admit, having a line from each song in reverse order is a gag I live for. She snapped here.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): A perfect ender to this strange album, combining all of the selected lyrics of each song. It feels satisfying that the song ended with "I am a bad guy", considering how successful the song is.

**Evanbrooks324** (9): hallelujah

**george\_kaito** (9): i love how it references prior songs. also the imogen heap jumped out

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I’m a sucker for ending tracks that reference the other songs on the album.

**twat\_brained** (9): [me when Billie closed her concert with bury a friend and this began to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFQQVEd5LoM)

**agentofscranton** (8.5): i love album closers like this - jon bellion's hand of god being the peak

**anothertown** (8.5): the structure of this outro may be a little overly literal but it is executed beautifully idc

**bulforster** (8.5): This doesn't really work as a standalone song but as an album closer designed to evoke a life flashing before dying eyes, it's (morbidly) great.

**puberty1** (8.5): i actually love when artists do this and i have to say that sometimes i listen to this song when im too lazy to listen to the whole album

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): a super cute way to end the album

**Agusarg** (8): Amazing closer

**alwayswords** (8): a beautiful conclusion to a beautiful album chefskiss

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, the supercut.

**fadedblue09** (8): I appreciate the creativity behind this, though I hope she did it with more coherence.

**hadea0090** (8): Love how this wraps up the album and the harmonies are really nice. If the lyrics actually meant something, it would've been a powerful ending tbh.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the reversal of this so much. A solid closer that sums up the album.

**jayjaysortagay** (8): good, works as a closer

**Nickl00** (8): it’s gimmicky but it’s so cool

**ReallyCreative** (8): everyone loves a callback, so why not make a song that is just callbacks?

**rhyneston3** (8): Cute closer

**Clearer-Skies** (7.5): serves as a perfect closer, and she sounds stunning, but I've found that I don't really listen to this as a standalone song

**akanewasright** (7): Good concept for an album closer. I honestly wonder how many songs this will beat.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Short and sweet.

**cleen\_claire** (7): good idea but idk i love you would've been a better closer

**Jimmy345960** (7): I love how this one closes everything up

**Johnnytoby** (7): something about those beginning chords make me want to see Billie do a dance album, I know she'd go crazy

**waluigiest** (7): a fun gimmick that mostly works but it is kind of silly, even with the overdone lyrics and production

**wavingwolves** (7): is this even a song? but i like it

**WeastofEden44** (7): I love the idea behind the song but wish it was executed better

**AnimationJava** (6.5): A good note to close the album on! very creative

**shesdoingyoga** (6.5): It’s pretty and a cool concept to have the lyrics be lyrics from the other songs in reverse order, but it would have worked better if the lyrics formed a more cohesive statement than they do

**untutorable** (6.5): i love a good reprise

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): Fitting end to the album, but unsure how well it works sonically.

**slazenger7** (6): Seems a bit self-indulgent. I see what she's trying to do to end the album...but as a song on its own merits, not so much.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): Interesting closer, but hard to rate it as a song in it's own right

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (6): cool idea but I kind of just wanted it to end

**leviswift13** (5): the novelty wore off after my first listen. really wished the album got a proper closer.

**ManofOranges** (5): I yet again have no words because here's another song from this album that I just do not remember. Goodbye to this song.

**nick1372** (5): I feel bad for rating these songs so low but I think it's bc I just don't get them because I'm not a depressed teenager

**Stryxen** (5): I understand the need and that’s about it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): kinda lazy as an ending

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): at least she knows what we're all feeling about this album by the end of it

**vayyiqra** (5): :wave: I like when albums have a coda like this even if they're not really songs.

**wasian-invasion** (4.5): eh the mashup just sounds weird like remember all the songs you just heard

**CarlieScion** (4): somehow more boring than the last song

**dreamingoutloud92** (4): Meh. Downer ending.

**Kromorei** (4): forgettable

**LeninaCrowne94** (4): Too edgy for me

**nooodisaster** (4): it's creative but... it's credits.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): I think I love you would have been a better place to end the album

**pearllouise** (4): okay bye bitch

**strangergravityfalls** (4): being self-referential for the sake of being self-referential is the most boring thing close on

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4): Pleasant but not really a song

**ladililn** (3.5): I like the idea of this, but not the actual sound of it.

**axestogrind** (3): I don't want to feed into balladphobia because it's already rampant on popheads but my favourite aspects on a Billie song are often the tight melody and interesting production... so when that's stripped away there's not much for me to personally enjoy

**bespectacIed** (3): ok

**FluffyNobody** (3): It was the first time I listened to the album with the regular track listing and not shuffling it, and like, why did she put almost all the sad songs in the end? After my strange addiction, the album progressively loses steam, and this is a really weak closer.

**ggodisawomann** (3): no

**meiscool132** (3): don't like the concept, don't really like the song

**rsmitty99** (3): This album kind of ended on a dull note for me.

**skargardin** (3): this was highly unnecessary, i love you would've been such a good outro, this serves little purpose

**TiltControls** (2.5): I liked the other ballads, but this is just boring

**Mysario** (2.1): who puts a song called "goodbye" on their album and makes it filler? i get its a good enough closer but....?

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.2): me @ this song

**Awkward\_King** (1): like why? its not a creative way to end an album its the most boring way to end by just giving one line from each song like? its just dumb

**Kanne\_** (0): no

akanewasright: I’m legitimately surprised at the low scores for this. 

Not really disappointed though. It’s not fair for an intro or outro to beat many tracks.

Imagine being a famous popstar at what is your peak so far, and about to release an album full of amazing songs that will resonate with the general public and get critically acclaimed. You had 5 huge singles in the past year, and anything you put out is destined to become a smash hit. The world is interested in you, your label is supporting you wholeheartedly and your fanbase is as hyped as they could be. There’s nothing standing in your way to dominate this entire year and have one of the biggest pop eras in recent memory…. and then you decide to kill any momentum you had on release day with this as a single.

*break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored* closing the *thank u, next* era doesn’t sit well with my soul, so I do have some resentment towards it, but it’s not a terrible song, it’s just pretty weak compared to the rest of the album, especially lyrically (apparently you can interpret it to be about self-love or something, but I think it’s just a hoe anthem). 
---

**Brendon-Urine** (10): this was my fav single and song from this album since it came out, mostly for that prechorus

**cashewconstellation** (10): A fun bop!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh

**Evanbrooks324** (10): idc how basic it is it's a bawp and the lyrics go awf

**george\_kaito** (10): A HOE ANTHEM

**ggodisawomann** (10): MMMM THE NSYNC SAMPLE PLEEEEASEEE

**Jimmy345960** (10): some great or bad memories associated with this track. Can't decide yet.

**Johnnytoby** (10): so my yt ex almost ruined this song for me by hinting he got bored with me WITH THIS SONG and waited 4 months to break up with me so fuck him...but this slaps

**mayolizard** (10): https://twitter.com/hillsidevids/status/1216265543470264320

**meiscool132** (10): an unapologetic anthem for sure, and the beat is absolutely everything! also I wish the original had the mv intro :/

**rsmitty99** (10): Best song on the album. Max Martin outdid himself. Hard to do with his catalogue. I remember seeing the tracklist and rolling my eyes at this title. I know I wasn't alone in that. Now no one cares. Also, that tri-tone vocal right before the chorus sent me when I first heard it. Fuck yeah, Max. Or whoever came up with that idea.

**Mysario** (9.6): this slaps! my fave tidbit is replacing the incredibly personal "Remember" with this slut drop

**hawksband** (9.5): deserved to go number one

**Kromorei** (9.5): unironically one of her best singles.

**alwayswords** (9): im obsessed with the conspiracy theory that this song is about matty healy from the 1975

**bandnitos** (9): i wish i was this bold with my songwriting

**CarlieScion** (9): im still angry about the music video going all ‘teasing lesbian/wlw sexuality, but actually its a metaphor for loving yourself’ ala liability by Lorde. But the song itself is good

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): yuh yuh

**Tolk1en** (9): a bop, I didn't like it first, but then I heard it live at the swt tour and the atmosphere especially during this song was amazing, everyone looking at each other screaming the chorus, a moment

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): i can recognize this song is trash, but sometimes you're in the mood for trash

**nooodisaster** (8.8): This song is a "Starboy" song for me. In that if I'm driving when this comes on I will instantly start to drive 10x more recklessly and pretend like I can swerve effortlessly in and out of lanes. It's a problem.

**slazenger7** (8.7): Just an iconic chorus. Basically the only Ari I listen to regularly.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): we love an nsync sample

**materialqirl** (8.5): kind of generic ngl

**franch** (8.4): i like it as an outro to the album but it's not my favorite

**WeastofEden44** (8.1): Bop

**anagalisgv** (8): the beat is . so good

**AnimationJava** (8): A good song but looking back on the era, it wasn't a good single choice. Ariana should've went with something more soccer mom friendly that could've gotten radio airplay.

**cleen\_claire** (8): closing it out with a bop, queen shit

**eeveefan01** (8): a good last single, but NASA was right there

**hunnybee12** (8): I honestly like this song as a closer. a ‘back on my bullshit’ anthem

**Kanne\_** (8): it's a whole bop im sorry!

**ManofOranges** (8): Feels like the more popular twin sister to bloodline, but just because she's more popular doesn't mean that she's better or anything. They're both just as remarkable, or unremarkable maybe, but they both serve their own purpose.

**rhyneston3** (8): I actually think this is really fun

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): it’s a fun song, it’s good too, but it doesn’t have that x factor that the other singles and some other songs in the album have

**twat\_brained** (7.4): the only reason this is outscoring 7 rings for me is that it helped bring NSYNC back into public consciousness. Ari deserves credit for that.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): It gets stuck in your head but it's not that great. And I don't really believe her retcon of this song as some sort of 'becoming a new person' message instead of a slut bop.

**bespectacIed** (7): moody pop at its saturation but it's still a bop

**cyborglilith** (7): video is pure cringe btw

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7): People hate on this song and act like they’ve never wanted to get with someone taken come on y’all

**lilacsweetener** (7): I’m in love with the dark, sultry production.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): yeah...she could’ve made another song the single except this but w/e.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): marginally better than 7 rings just bc it's not as overplayed for me

**puberty1** (7): yuh yuh

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i actually liked this on release but now it's more meh. i get what they were trying to do but i don't think it fits on the album well.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6.5): Still bitter that we got this instead of reMeMber

**radiofan15** (6.5): I guess this is fine and everything, but... why is this the album closer?

**anothertown** (6): character creator menu type beat, but the nsync deep cut is so good

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): This song really shouldn't exist.

**strangergravityfalls** (6): i posted "break up with your girlfriend, i'm gay" on twitter as a sort of drunk coming out, but everyone just thought i was commenting on ariana grande queerbaiting

**Stryxen** (6): for a pretty big song its odd that I have nothing to say…

**wasian-invasion** (6): it's ok by itself but really jarring right after thank u next

**cremeebrulee** (5): the one thing i will never understand is why ari decided to end this album with the worst song on it. “oh she’s trying to show that she’s going back to her old ways” idc it sucks. this song is so uninspired. plus she clearly states she never met the dude so like wtf???? this should’ve been a bonus track (let alone a single) or something so that the album actually ended with tun.

**gannade** (5): you would be bored if u made this song

**jayjaysortagay** (5): the production on thie verses is golden but everything else is tacky, this is a 7 in general but a 5 compared to this rate.

**nick1372** (5): it's fine but suffers from Terrible Chorus Syndrome

**Nickl00** (5): it’s funny but also annoying

**skargardin** (5): it's there, aged like milk

**untutorable** (5): same except just the "i'm bored" part

**Anthony-Vince** (4): With such a great title it's a shame this song is so mediocre

**mms82** (4): sorry ari i'm bored with this song

**ReallyCreative** (4): Why is this track here.... just end the album with the title track, Ariana come on now...

**runaway3212** (4): no.

**vayyiqra** (4): (Yuh-yuh) Bweak up witcho guhlfrennn (yuh-yuh) 'cause I'm bohhhhhed I get this song is not meant to be taken 100% seriously, but still, what a selfish and toxic message to build a song around. I like the instrumental, but the lyrics are too cringe. It's catchy, but that just makes it worse. I hate that I want to like this song.

**vhqv1997** (4): This was the start of the atrocious trap beat she abuses on every single song released after this album

**hadea0090** (3): a shitty closer to the album smh

**kappyko** (3): no

**plantp0wer** (3): doesn’t work as a closing track

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): funnily enough, i am also bored!

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (3): Terrible closer. Should have been thank u next.

**Awkward\_King** (2): i just fucking hate it

**leviswift13** (2): so close to the zero, but 7 rings beat it. i just think it's absolutely shallow and not the sassy pop bop i wanted from this title.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (2): i'm booooored

**pearllouise** (2): It's okay, Ariana. I'm bored too listening to your shitty song.

**PoppyPigglet** (2): ari release a good single from this era challenge.

**1998tweety** (1): Awful awful awful song. Another song where only delusional stans like it. This is laughably bad, the chorus is such a mouthful and not catchy at all. thank u, next should've ended the album off and this should've gotten cut. What an embarrassment that an MPG has shit like this on her album.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): Insert Raja 'I'M BORED!' gif.

**fadedblue09** (1): Wow imagine closing a good album with one of the worst possible choices for a closing track. Is this supposed to be another coping mechanism of hers? If so, it really ends the album on a bad note and cheapens the character development Ariana has shown. Music-wise, it’s nothing either, very generic and forgettable.

**FluffyNobody** (1): Name a worse closer, I'll wait

**frogaranaman** (1): what the fuck

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I don’t get it, she had the PERFECT closing track with “thank u, next” and then she tacked on this piece of trash. The message is bad, the song sounds boring, I’m mad that this was a hit.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): she really ended the album with this, yikes.

**TiltControls** (1): album would have been better with this moved up earlier in the tracklist (or cut entirely)

**waluigiest** (1): what was she thinking. This is so uninspired. Not a good line in the song.

**akanewasright** (0): This song doesn’t belong here. It’s not a bad song okay it kind of is but it’s so stupid and shallow after an album of honesty and genuine self-examination. I hate that this song ends the album so much, it’s not even funny.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): it was initially difficult to pick a zero from such a bland and insipid album but at least the other two contenders grew on me a tiny bit. this has been a huge annoyance to hear since the day it dropped and honestly rivals Put Your Hearts Up for worst ariana song of all time

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (0): Ugh, if I have to give a 0 to a song at this rate, it has to be this one. Yeah, the song has dope production by Max Martin but I didn't like how this was chosen as the closer for the album when the titular track is right there. I also really dislike the message of this song. I don't care if Ariana is joking or not but she is basically condoning cheating. Pop culture has the power to normalize things so this is a terrible message to send out there. Let's hope common sense prevails here

**RandomHypnotica** (0): how did a song that on paper should've been amazing go so so so SO wrong?

**wavingwolves** (0): this has no redeeming qualities

**frogaranaman** (10): this song reminds me of walking home drunk in the streets of Europe belting my heart out

**ignitethephoenix** (10): fuck covid for taking away Billie’s bond theme moment. Still amazing though and her full voice at the end is amazing

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a song so good, they delayed the movie so people can have time to fully appreciate it

**jayjaysortagay** (10): perfect, I hope the movie delay doesn't sink this. Its so haunting.

**pearllouise** (10): Well I guess there isn't any time left to die bc this film got delayed till November and AMC wont even show it and I oop

**radiofan15** (10): In a perfect world we would have gotten this movie already... shame on you rona! P.S. I love the classic James Bond guitar riff at the end

**rhyneston3** (10): Actually a great song

**rickikardashian** (10): if skyfall and whatever sam smith’s song was called were able to win an oscar, this better do it too

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I don’t know what exactly I was expecting at the news of a Billie song for a Bond movie, but this definitely exceeded my expectations. The first time I heard the long note towards the end my jaw actually dropped

**Stryxen** (10): I didn't like this until the brits performance what a moment

**twat\_brained** (10): SHE'S SINGING IN CHEST VOICE MOM GET THE CAMERA

**mayolizard** (9.5): smash

**meiscool132** (9.5): really amazing and perfectly Bond-esque! and I never knew I needed that belt from Billie until I heard it

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): Haunting and cinematic, the lyrics leave something to be desired though

**Mysario** (9.1): the 8th worst part about this quarantine is that all movies have been pushed back so they can get more money. I was pretty excited for this movie even if I'm not an avid James Bond fan. best James Bond theme song was "Another Way to Die" by Jack White and Alicia Keys btw

**alwayswords** (9): the ending chefskiss

**cremeebrulee** (9): starts off a lil dull but the end where it builds up is incredible. grammy incoming.

**dreamingoutloud92** (9): The production is great, honestly it fits very well in the James Bond universe.

**hockey\_newfoundland** (9): One of my favourite Bond themes of all time,

**moooo566** (9): im the dude who loves die another day, a real sucker for a bond theme

**muchopartymuchomoney** (9): i was disappointed when it came out but now it's grown on me

**ReallyCreative** (9): A song where Billie really gets to shine, I hope she explores some more piano ballad type stuff in the future, she does amazing work with this

**skargardin** (9): pretty stunning bond theme, sucks that we'll have to wait so long to hear it on the big screen

**mms82** (8.8): was amazing but this song died in my thoughts like the film did

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is a really great Bond theme song. The lyrics definitely fit the theme of the movie and it’s also on-brand with Billie’s aesthetic.

**franch** (8.5): huh? why isn't this part of the album (yes i know it's because of the movie etc)? this is like ocean eyes level vibing...

**Mazike** (8.4): yesssss

**Awkward\_King** (8): ok i know im gay before saying this but lemme suggest something, im very happy with this bond theme i think it pretty good and billie is amazing and deserves it, but in my ideal world they stuck with the thing of a british musician and chose dua and had a fucking disco/future nostalgiia esque bond theme, like imagine something like break my heart aesthetically but darker and topical lyrics. thats just so cool in my mind? but it would never happen? or even having dynasty by rina, but thats something we purely dont deserve

**bandnitos** (8): it's good but it doesn't have a lot of replay value

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): I'm digging this more than most of her album. Actually excited to see this with the visual. And oh my god, she's actually showing off VOCALS??? She can SANG??? Damn, Selena Gomez is crying in a corner.

**bespectacIed** (8): Best bond theme since skyfall

**cleen\_claire** (8): that high note gives me chills every damn time

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8): Nice classic Bond theme. I just felt it lacked more power during climax.

**leviswift13** (8): solid bond theme!! not my personal fav, but i appreciate the goth drama of it all

**materialqirl** (8): stannage

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This isn’t better than Skyfall, but it’s better so than the Sam Smith theme.

**Nickl00** (8): almost as good as sky fall but not quite

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this is basically the same song as Writing's On The Wall

**1998tweety** (7): It's alright

**anagalisgv** (7): nice, very Bond-y, very forgettable

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): They should've stopped doing Bond themes at Skyfall.

**fadedblue09** (7): Instrumental is too dramatic, which isn't really her type of angst. Though I appreciate it for its mature vibe.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): oh honey there’s ALWAYS time to die! * /dies *

**nooodisaster** (7): sloooow burn but pretty good.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i wish it built to something though

**runaway3212** (7): It's a pretty standard bond song

**sandyfishnets** (7): ...(007)

**vayyiqra** (7): please reopen cinemas soon I am a spy movie stan and need this

**waluigiest** (7): it’s no skyfall but

**WeastofEden44** (7): I like the orchestrations

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): I originally was hoping for a less traditional Bond theme given Billie’s sound but after a couple months this is a pretty good song, and it shows versatility so i guess I can get into it

**hadea0090** (6.5): kinda predictable but not bad i guess

**puberty1** (6.5): something something coronavirus something something bond movie postponed something something title of this song

**Kromorei** (6): mid tier billie is still above average everyone else

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i just find bond themes in general boring

**ggodisawomann** (5): Billie is just so so mid to meeee pleaseeee

**wavingwolves** (5): i don't think i've ever liked a bond theme in my life

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Yeah.. This is one of the only Billie songs I'm not fond of at all.

**Johnnytoby** (4): omg forgot she was james bond too wth this gorl is so young

**ManofOranges** (2): I think this song is good enough as a Bond theme. It's clearly meant to have that cinematic feeling that accompanies a movie preview as the shots are in slo-mo and have fades between. I see it so clearly in my head. But it's not gonna be a song that I actually seek out or want to listen to any time soon.

It may be a pattern for Ari irl, but the album is honestly a pretty decent character study that has no details of her seducing random guys away from their girlfriends.

One of the more experimental songs Taylor did for Lover. It's a calming and sweet ballad that narrates the story of a relationship going from friends to partners, so *You Are In Love 2.0*. It's an adorable ride, but it's pretty one note and it has the feeling of an interlude that's a minute longer than it should.

@ the 4 people who gave this 11s, y tho

---

**george\_kaito** (11): listening to this song at 2 in the morning & letting the "oooohs" envelop your brain hits different

**vhqv1997** (11): This is the best song in this rate, and I am definitely not alone in this opinion.

**Agusarg** (10): For some reason I love it

**bandnitos** (10): i want what she has

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I am very sure this song will get out at Day One so this is me giving this underrated bop a 10. It took a while for this song to grow on me. The production gave this feeling of a "cloudy supercut" as we see two people who grew up from childhood friends to a married couple. The way Taylor sang this song kinda sounds like Post Malone and it’s backed up by the fact Frank Dukes and Louis Bell produced this song, whom Posty collabs often. Apparently, there are theories that TS8 might end up sounding like this so I am all for it.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): As I'm writing this comment I realize that I'm too tired and not eloquent enough to write out paragraphs on how risky and outlandish this song really is and why I think it's important. This is destined to remain one of the most precious hidden gems in Taylor's discography. I'm holding out hope for an album of hers that would incorporate the same musical prospects as this song does.

**fadedblue09** (10): Very simplistic-sounding, and it gives off heartwarming and haunting vibes simultaneously. I also loved that cute horn instrumental bit. It sounds like an intro to something big, but instead we got….

**ggodisawomann** (10): people say it's weird just like IFTYE, but I disagree. cute and unique for Taylor.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I like this, it sounds like something AJR would have put on their latest album or “Another Opinion” by Meghan Trainor. It’s a pleasant chill out kind of song, and I like how short it is. It makes its point and that’s enough. Definitely my favorite Taylor song in years.

**Johnnytoby** (10): this better not go before MEh, it's so simple yet cute and atmospheric

**leviswift13** (10): does not deserve any slander. an innocent, emotional gem.

**Mysario** (10): this song is unfairly hated on when it's possibly her cutest and most ambitious songs when it comes to her sound, even if it's incredibly simple

**puberty1** (10): i think i've championed this song enough times in this community, but yeah, I really really love this one and it almost got my 11. it reminds me of Cold Little Heart (the opening song of Big Little Lies) and it's just so... experimental and adorable at the same time. just please read GoWestYoungKanye Lover's write up because she did this song justice that it won't get from this rate sadly

**1998tweety** (9.5): Another song that'll be ROBBED. I swear if she just stuck the work Interlude at the end y'all would like this a lot more. Also please tell me I'm not the only one reading a wlw subtext here.

**FluffyNobody** (9.5): Remember how the secret sessioners had no taste and said this was worse than ME! And Stay stay stay? Anyway, I braced myself for the worst when I listened to this for the first time, and I found an absolute gem instead. One of the best moments in the album.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): I adore this song. A successful perfect musical representation of winter holidays cuddled up to your love

**mms82** (9.3): such a cute couple minutes

**akanewasright** (9): This song is going to get slaughtered, but I love it.

**CarlieScion** (9): very pretty

**cleen\_claire** (9): I love Taylor Swift so much

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the steel drums in this are such a nice touch

**runaway3212** (9): Remember when we all though this would be the worst song on lover before it came out and it turned out to still be ME! ?

**Austine567** (8.5): this song is so neat

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): Can't relate to this at all but I'll fantasize while vibing to this gorgeous tune.

**hadea0090** (8): I love the background vocals

**lapascalia** (8): Underrated song on this album, sounds beautiful.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This is honestly super underrated.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8): i love the atmosphere of this song, i'd love to see Taylor experiment more with this sound

**waluigiest** (8): this track is so bizarre and out of place but I like it and the steel drums a lot

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.8): It's only higher from others for the fact that she put a marimba and a trompet in the same song without being a salsa/tropical song. We love an experimental queen! Shame that it's such a plain song.

**franch** (7.8): same filler comment as Afterglow...

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): i NEED to know what video games she’s referring to in this song like imagine taylor playing dark souls or smth

**ladililn** (7.8): I was very ???? about this song until I tried listening to it as though it was by some mildly quirky indie artist instead of Taylor Swift. IDK what it says about me that that made the song click, probably nothing good.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): I can't put it into better words, but the production here is really evocative and beautiful.

**radiofan15** (7.6): I can't hate this because there's trumpets in here

**patcheso8** (7.5): cute but the instrumentation is a choice

**PointlessBibliophage** (7.5): it's cute and experimental - i like it but don't love it.

**Stryxen** (7.5): the instrumentals are incredible. the lyrics are ok, but thanks for trying <3

**wardrum5** (7.5): I wonder what video game Taylor was playing. Probably Bloodborne.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): Once more, there is nothing WRONG with this, but it's... just that.

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7): The steel drums were an odd choice but it’s good subject matter

**kappyko** (7): i like this it sounds unique

**lilacsweetener** (7): It’s like a warm hug in poem form. Reminds me of being inside on a snowy day. Amazing how she blends elements of her own relationship into a fictional story about two kids becoming lovers as they grow up.

**mayolizard** (7): cute

**nick1372** (7): I appreciate this one

**pearllouise** (7): We love the Abominable theme song

**rhyneston3** (7): This is quite sweet actually

**skargardin** (7): it sure is

**slazenger7** (6.8): Good to see experimentation, but this song isn't particularly compelling.

**ladywolvs** (6.5): generic, sounds like it should be on the big little lies soundtrack

**rsmitty99** (6.5): Doesn't go much anywhere

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): can’t relate

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): i… dont know how to feel about this. good on you for trying something new tho

**anagalisgv** (6): the steel drum seems SO out of place here

**cremeebrulee** (6): yet another track i would cut from this album.

**cyborglilith** (6): weird and forgettable song

**eeveefan01** (6): A grower

**ManofOranges** (6): It IS nice to have a friend and it's also nice to make the song interesting but just because something is nice doesn't mean it's gonna happen. This just feels like it's here because Taylor wanted to squeeze just one more song into the album for some reason.

**shesdoingyoga** (6): This somehow ends up sound cute and creepy at the same time which adds up to being kind of unsettling overall

**WeastofEden44** (6): Rupaul voice Meh

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (6): not a lot to hate but not a lot to like

**avenueroy** (5.9): She knew what she was doing. She knew she was giving fanfic writers and fanvid editors a gift. She knew.

**dreamingoutloud92** (5.5): Too experimental I guess? Idk

**Anthony-Vince** (5): I'm sorry, I just think this song is boring no matter how many people hype it up. I like the idea of it but every time I hear it I just get bored.

**J\_Toe** (5): it's unusual and I want to like it, but it's not very playlistable (which is my metric for listening to music. If you guys are die hard It's Nice to Have a Friend fans, than good for you. You're enjoying good music).

**meiscool132** (5): I like the instrumental, but overall the song annoys me

**untutorable** (5): it's cute i guess.... tbh i wish i liked it more than i do

**vayyiqra** (5): Yeah sure it is until you can't go outside and see them because of a viral disease outbreak. Remember friends?

**cashewconstellation** (4): Boring. An absolutely unnecessary addition to the album.

**jayjaysortagay** (4): 😴😴😴

**ReallyCreative** (4): I am begging you Taylor to sing from a perpsective that doesn't involve high school in some way. I appreciate that she tries something different and dissonant in the instrumentation/background vocals here but it goes on too long and gives me a headache.

**wavingwolves** (4): i have to say, this song makes me a little uncomfortable because it sounds like the opening credits for big little lies (which is a little... creepy? mysterious?) and this is supposed to be... cute? i think? i don't know what to think

**hikkaru** (3): i still don't get why

**ImADudeDuh** (3): lol

**LesApfels** (3): It sounds like the last song the camp counsellors play during the bonfire to kill the mood and get the kids to go sleep

**Nickl00** (3): another song that goes nowhere

**RandomHypnotica** (3): This feels like an interlude that was accidentally looped

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this sounds like a children’s playground song

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (3): I know this is a personal one for Taylor, but calling it a song is generous. It's spoken poetry over something vaguely resembling music. The shortest song here, but still too boring to get through.

**twat\_brained** (3): wait that's it? that was barely a song! it came and it went before i could get into it, which i most certainly could not do with its faux reggae tone

**Kromorei** (2.5): yawn like honestly half the b sides here are killing me

**nooodisaster** (1): This song is so bad the first time I heard it I thought there was going to be a mic-drop moment when it's revealed the dude was dead the whole time or something.

**SFbby** (1): This is by far the worst Taylor thing to ever exist and I refuse to label it as a song

**ignitethephoenix** (0): the oooo’s in the background make me think of Big Little Lies for some reason haha. Song is boring and goes no where otherwise. It’s so short yet I was just waiting for this to end half way.

Nothing says "I am completely over the drama we had and the damage you caused me" than writing a whole song talking about how you don't even think about  it.

I Forgot That You Existed, the "pop *State of Grave*" according to secret sessioners, is the album's opener, and it does its best to bridge the themes from *reputation* and "Lover*'s, but being honest, it's a bit of a mess. The songwriting is painfully mediocre and the production, although cute, isn't very memorable. It's an unfinished product released solely so Taylor could seem *unbothered😌💅✨* that gets immediately overshadowed by the 10 first seconds of *Cruel Summer*

---

**fadedblue09** (10): Catchy, bouncy and probably one of the few times that pure, fun-loving Taylor didn’t annoy me. This is better than most of the filler Swifties keep glorifying.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I know everyone says this song is weird but something about it is very elevated sounding to me and I loved it on first listen

**mudkip1** (10): i like this!! fuck the haterz

**TiltControls** (10): Leftovers from the Taylor from Reputation, except actually over a well produced track (jk. sort of.)

**Mysario** (9.3): even though it doesn't totally fit into the album and its themes, I really enjoy this song, especially as an opener

**franch** (9): solid intro song, blending the anger of Reputation with the optimism of Lover.

**mms82** (9): honestly a cute way to move from the Reputation era

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): i love petty taylor what can i say

**rhyneston3** (9): I love when Taylor sort of sing talks

**wasian-invasion** (9): the wit the meta the laugh the drake her best album intro since state of grace

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): This is a cute and fun song to kick the album off on. Probably in my personal top 5 from here.

**mayolizard** (8.8): Dropping .2 points for the drake and reputation references

**plastichaxan** (8.5): I'd never forget this exists

**redgold51** (8.5): Such a perfect transition between Rep and Lover

**bandnitos** (8): a cute opener

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): It's not as epic of an opener as ...Ready For It? but it's cute (except for the Drake line eyeroll)

**Brendon-Urine** (8): Cute intro! I love the instrumental

**CreepyMannequin** (8): good intro

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Better than most people give it credit for.

**gabcac** (8): I really like this song as the album opener, leaving all the madness behind and you can say this song is the only Calvin related song.

**hikkaru** (8): ok i do like this it's a fun sassy bop but i'm thinking about when a secret session swiftie called this "state of grace but pop" STATE OF GRACE SWEETIE I'M SO SORRY

**lapascalia** (8): Sassy but classy!

**leviswift13** (8): a breezy opener and a nice palette cleanser coming off of reputation. the secret sessioners who said this was a new state of grace are on drugs, but it is an easygoing, sassy, light and welcoming opening track.

**lilacsweetener** (8): This took forever to grow on me but it’s top 5 now. If you’ve ever had bad people try to act important once you’ve long moved on, every word applies. It’s lightweight but only because letting go of baggage gets rid of dead weight. A real pleasure to listen to vocally too.

**ManofOranges** (8): It's a nice enough opener, I guess. I think it gets the job done.

**materialqirl** (8): pretty solid

**muchopartymuchomoney** (8): musically it's pretty bland, but i like the message and simple way the song conveys it

**NotWith10000Men** (8): y'all hate this one but it's one of my faves

**runaway3212** (8): Taylor sets the tone for a very different album than we got, but it's still pretty enjoyable

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): we love an immature bop

**waluigiest** (8): reputation 🤝 lover

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): This is a bop and it's given since Frank Dukes and Louis Bell are involved in the production. But I'll forever be mad at that Swiftie who went to the Lover Secret Sessions and said this song sounded like State of Grace. Like bitch where?????????

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): It's fine but I kind of lose track of it so the title also describes the track

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): not one of my favourite's off Lover but it's a cute tune and v relaxing

**twat\_brained** (7.4): I was ready to use this or YNTCD as a retort to anyone who sent me 22 on my birthday this year. I did not have to do such a thing. What I will do is replay this.

**anagalisgv** (7): cute but the number of syllables squeezed into the chorus throw me off

**cashewconstellation** (7): It's a nice song! Nothing extraordinary, but it's fun.

**FluffyNobody** (7): A cute bop, I personally hate the fake laugh, but I love the beat

**george\_kaito** (7): petty taylor is my favourite taylor. anyways she's cute but i hate the "...so yeah" at the end

**Jimmy345960** (7): Ok opener, I like its META and its connection to LYWMMD and better than welcome to new york.

**meiscool132** (7): Fun, nice, and the piano melody makes me feel like I could play it even though I've only ever played happy birthday

**Nickl00** (7): I’ll never forgot someone mentions that if she really forgot about him she wouldn’t be making an entire song

**nooodisaster** (7): As an album opener to Liver, this is some booty. As a standalone, it's deceptively addictive. So... yeah.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): I like this, ngl it’s relatable

**ladililn** (6.8): Like Taylor, I was dumped out of the blue by someone I considered a friend for life. Like Taylor, I like to pretend I’m totally over it and won’t be bitter and petty until the day I die. Unfortch there is a thin line between "stripped back" and “sounds like a demo,” and this song is slightly on the wrong side of it.

**Mazike** (6.7): I deadass forgot that this song existed

**eeveefan01** (6.5): All i can say is I forgot that you existed

**radiofan15** (6.5): I can see the purpose of the song and everything but it truly needed something else to stand out, as it is it's quite bland... also, "In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah" is a terrible lyric overall OMG

**shesdoingyoga** (6.5): I like the song as a transition between her eras, but it is otherwise unremarkable and underwhelming as an opener.

**WeastofEden44** (6.4): I'm whelmed

**avenueroy** (6.3): This sounds like a generic late 2010s CanCon song, the type that you instantly clock as a mandate by the radio stations. "No one really likes it, but we can't just play Shawn Mendes six times an hour, can we?" What a bad album opener.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): me @ this song

**Stryxen** (6.1): Taylor Move On Quietly challenge

**Anthony-Vince** (6): Good track, but not super necessary and kind of filler-y. That being said I still bop to it.

**bulforster** (6): I like the instrumental and chorus quite a bit but Taylor cannot pull off some of the verses' lyrics. I also wish she didn't embellish her delivery as the song progresses, the laughing and speaking the end of lines isn't cute and clashes with how tight the song is, which I think is its best quality.

**Evanbrooks324** (6): , it's not a bad track but it's very forgettable

**hawksband** (6): i forgot that this existed

**JanuaryFourteenth** (6): I like it for the most part, but it’s very Taylor Swift of her to write a whole song about forgetting that someone exists like I know it’s obvious but how do you write a song about someone you forget about

**jayjaysortagay** (6): I don't really care about Taylor and I've literally never heard this song before right now but it has a cute 2012 bop feel to it.

**kappyko** (6): wish something punchier was in this place, this is a very lowkey intro. there are two aspects in songs on this album that i get annoyed by the most: the sloganeering lyrics (in this case, the shade part that ends up carrying over into another song) and the inflections that go into almost-spoken word

**Kromorei** (6): insert pun about forgetting this song existed

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): nothing really says i’m over you like writing the intro to your album about them

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): Kinda groovey, but doesn't match up with the rest of the album

**wardrum5** (6): Such a slow opener

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): its fun. thats kinda it but tbh thats enough here

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): It's cute but there's next to no substance. We're kinda tired of hearing about the h8rs Ms. Swift

deleted: **alwayswords** (5): this sounds like “i like me better” by lauv and that isn’t a compliment

**CarlieScion** (5): in my feelings more than drake…. I cannot deal with the lyrical genius of Taylor Allison swift

**cleen\_claire** (5): It's just so nothing

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): You guys ever think Taylor considered, y'know, actually taking the advice she sings about?

**RainbowRaider2** (5): Overrated as hell, not the best start to the album.

**rsmitty99** (5): This reminds me of how I listened to 1989 for the first time years ago and was turned off immediately with the first song (Welcome to New York). I get opening with this as it tells people she's moved on from all that Kanye drama (only for it to be brought up again this year). It's just bland

**skargardin** (5): appropriate title

**untutorable** (5): https://tenor.com/NfLB.gif

**vayyiqra** (5): It's cute, but a little childish, and in the end it's just ... indifference.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.9): in my feelings more than drake’s

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): This would be a decent song for Katy Perry or Olivia O’Brien but Taylor just can’t sell it. Her voice isn’t powerful enough to give the song any punch and the only way she knows how to convey the emotions the song is about is to drop into this weird fake valley girl voice that’s so annoying.

**pearllouise** (4.5): The title of this song says it all.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): The chorus just feels so... clunky?

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.5): It's cute but lacking in gravitas -- needed more production, lyrics a little cringey at times

**agentofscranton** (4): i remember playing this album for the first time and this coming on and i was so so so disappointed, because i was worried that taylor had just released another album talking about her rep. i was wrong, but that doesn't stop this song from being bad.

**akanewasright** (4): I don’t hate this song, but I won’t be sad if it goes early. The lyrics are some of the worst in the rate.

**anothertown** (4): overly literal, samey, and I hate the royalty-free type beat

**frogaranaman** (4): this song is the sonic equivalent of texting your ex, waiting for their response, deleting your initial text to screenshot the conversation, then posting on social media "ugh these dumb boys just can't get over me 🙄"

**patcheso8** (4): this just ain't it. I don't mind the sentiment but I don't like it as an album opener and I hate how she ends it "so...yeah..."

**plantp0wer** (4): not the most memorable opener

**PoppyPigglet** (4): this was such a disappointing first track to hear

**RosaPalms** (4): anthem for acting like you aren't pressed when you're really oh so pressed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i dont love i dont hate its just indifference

**wavingwolves** (4): everyone and their mothers will probably try to drag this song saying they forgot it existed but what they don't understand is that taylor made a song this bland with that exact purpose... it's so meta... she's a genius. we stan!

**MaximumFriendship** (3): choices!

**nick1372** (3): Cut the crap Taylor we know you haven't forgotten shit

**SFbby** (3): I forget that this song exists all the time

**AnimationJava** (2): This song is the one from the album I skip the most.

**hadea0090** (2): doesn't really fit with the rest of the album and she supposedly forgot that that person existed yet wrote a whole song about them and made it the opening. ok.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Taylor please stop fucking bringing up your past drama. If you said you moved on, so stop mentioning it oml

**vhqv1997** (2): I hate this type of attitude song from Mrs. Swift so much. This is the sort of anthem that girls who dropped out of high school and became Instagram influencers only to whine about being mistreated for not being able to sell anything during a global pandemic would bop to unironically.

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (2): she really made a song to tell someone she doesn't think about them anymore. huh

**1998tweety** (1): You can really tell how delusional a Swiftie is based on what they score this. This is really really not good and only being who are completely delusional will score it highly. There's nothing I like about this sorry. It's not catchy at all and the production is empty and boring, the lyrics are fucking AWFUL. Fortunately for Taylor there are more offensive songs in this rate so my 0 will be used elsewhere.

**bespectacIed** (1): Taylor's worst opener ever. It's corny, bland, and doesn't blend with Lover's theme and story at all

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): I straight-up do not believe you.

**puberty1** (0): bad. really really bad

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): are you SURE I can't give bonus rate songs my 11

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Awww this is cute! I love how this song is a bit more happier than Billie’s usual songs. This song made me feel so warm like I am in Christmas.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): All I can think about is that post that says that [“Everyday” by Buddy Holly](https://youtu.be/ZZ8erxalpm4) sounds like a man jacking off because this song has the same energy

**jayjaysortagay** (8): I don't understand why this wasn't in the album. I would take out My Strange Addiction and out this in and it would be even perfect-er.

**meiscool132** (8): really comforting, especially the guitar

**nooodisaster** (8): see this is actually different for billie and is a great change of pace. she pulls off cute and encouraging well.

This is a Lizzo^TM song, and it works for a while but I don’t find that it has a ton of replay value. 

It’s fun, fun production, and Lizzo’s voice is literally the only voice that could be here, but I struggle to see me listening to this on replay like I can with other Lizzo songs. 

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): initially my least favorite but holy hell did it grow on me

**Agusarg** (10): The instrumental is amazing, love the prince vibes

**Kanne\_** (10): Melanie Martinez could never

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): i'm sorry Fergie

**TiltControls** (10): This song would not work for many other artists. She really kills it here

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i didn't realise how much i kinda love this song it sounds kinda confused but i've grown to love it it feels perfectly punky and funky

**CarlieScion** (9): BIG GIRLS GOTTA CRY

**cremeebrulee** (9): i have no idea what the public opinion on this song is but i FUCKING love it. it is so funky??

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Oh this is FUNKY.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): damn I slept on this album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): not even gonna say her name but lizzo ended her

**radiofan15** (8.8): Lizzo make a rock album... I dare you gurl, DO IT!

**rsmitty99** (8.5): This is very prince. Love it

**wavingwolves** (8.5): hot

**WeastofEden44** (8.4): This song left me SHOOKT when I first heard it and it still does to this day

**Anthony-Vince** (8): Love the instrumentals!

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): Funky and fresh. It seems a little been there done that already in this album but she still sells it.

**cleen\_claire** (8): Shit smacks

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I don't really vibe with this that much, however the "I don't need to apologize" line POPS THE FUCK OFF.

**george\_kaito** (8): janis joplin could never!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): wait this was good why haven’t i replayed this

**Nickl00** (8): the guitars never get old

**ReallyCreative** (8): Very good but not great, Lizzo giving those vo-kills tho, and "Just take me home I'm feeling vulnerable" sends me every single time

**twat\_brained** (8): This is like if Justin Timberlake only recorded Pusher Love Girl as a demo and decided he didn't want it so instead Lizzo did everything right that Justin did wrong. And it is lovely.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.6): love the prince vibes in this

**runaway3212** (7.5): It's pretty good!

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): Melanie wishes she had the range. Also, the song is good but doesn’t really stand out like the ones before it

**Mysario** (7.3): I get where the sound is coming from but I just don't think it's executed as well as I know it could be

**slazenger7** (7.2): The belting is getting tiresome.

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7): Lizzo’s voice and range is just insane and powerful.

**jayjaysortagay** (7): fun but not special

**kappyko** (7): holy shit i just realized she said "cry for me" at the end of the last song omg her mind a 10 for that (also this bein really good). why is this "Cry Baby" on apple music........

**Kromorei** (7): ended melanie

**pearllouise** (7): But you don't fucking care

**rhyneston3** (7): Eh, not her strongest, still super fun though

**skargardin** (7): slightly overproduced bop

**Stryxen** (7): feels a bit like Jerome but shorter and angrier

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7): that "i don't need to apologise" just REALLY HITS

**avenueroy** (6.8): There's something Off about this song, something that keeps it from sounding great, but I can't figure out what it is

**1998tweety** (6.5): This ain't really clicking for me oop, it's different though.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Slightly more energetic, but kinda falls flat. It doesn't match her energy and the only memorable part is the loud drum riff at the beginning.

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): blends together and is kinda samey to some other songs on this album but I still enjoy it

**cashewconstellation** (6.1): It doesn't really go anywhere

**AnimationJava** (6): The guitar on this was a really nice touch

**bandnitos** (6): it's not my thing

**hadea0090** (6): the production sounds too overcrowded

**meiscool132** (5.5): annoys me for some reason, I'm sorry Lizzo

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (5.5): just not very good

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): My least favorite song in the album, just too many elements, even if the message is right.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This album gets off to a tremendous start but this is where it starts to stall. In general I find the “loudness” of the album to be a plus but this is the only song where it truly bothers me. Interestingly I’d say that the verses actually outshine the chorus here, they have fun lyrics and Lizzo shows a lot of personality.

**Jimmy345960** (5): dont like this one, i forget this one all the time

**leviswift13** (5): this is a song. it have lyrics and production and some singing. it begins and ends. i've listened to it.

**ManofOranges** (5): I by and large feel the same way about this song as I do Jerome. I don't like it that much and I'm really just waiting for something else to come along to mix the album up a little because by now it's feeling one note without really good sound to justify it.

**nick1372** (5): you'd think Lizzo can't be "too much" by definition but she's bordering on it here

**nooodisaster** (5): zzzzzz

**vayyiqra** (5): :pensive:

**waluigiest** (5): I always fear when this song starts. Her voice is great but the rest of the song is kind of grating. The bridge is excellent tho

**bespectacIed** (4): amazing instrumentation but the song's kinda grating

**mayolizard** (3.3): i don't like this

**vhqv1997** (2): At some point we gotta admit this many shouty choruses in a row are too much.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): Just verrrry loud and not very melodic

**alwayswords** (1): this hurts my ears

One day I was scrolling on my For You Page, and I started noticing there were many videos being done with this song. My first reaction was "oh boy, Lizzo's about to have another song blow up thanks to TikTok, let's gooooo". And then people grabbed the sound and decided to make transphobic videos with it, so that was on that.

This is very fun and high energy, and it also has a decent Gucci Mane feature, but it’s way too repetitive for its own good and not as clever as many other songs in the album.
---

**anagalisgv** (11): so happy! so cool! so fun! exactly how i want to feel at all times!

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): yet another banger alert

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): a bop. i don't even like Gucci Mane but i love this.

**Nickl00** (10): Im always surprised at how good Gucci is on this song but Lizzo is just as good

**rsmitty99** (10): again. Sing. Bitch. I also like Gucci in this. Usually I could take or leave him all the time. But he actually molds into this song effortlessly

**wardrum5** (9.3): I don't understand how people don't love this song. Gucci's verse is so fun to rap along with

**fadedblue09** (9.2): Deserved to be longer! Probably the better of the rapper collabs.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): love the throwback sound on this

**1998tweety** (9): Bop, both of them ate this up [2]

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): “you either not with me or with me” Gucci Mane is my king

**kappyko** (9): WAIT THAT TRANSITION LOL. This is way too short but put this on repeat babyyyy

**mayolizard** (9): kinda really like dis but i cannot stand the republicans on tiktok using the chorus of this song to say racist shit sdggsdgds

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I’ve seen this compared to Meghan Trainor a lot so I assume that means it’s a critical darling.

**Mysario** (8.1): it might be the only time I say this but Gucci Mane is the best part of this track

**cleen\_claire** (8): True bop, too short

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): DAMN this album is good af.

**nootnoot781** (8): shame it birthed such bigoted tiktoks :(

**runaway3212** (8): Amazing sound, lizzo at her best

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Sounds great, I only wish it was a bit longer

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): a bop that needs a little more time, it's just too quick

**WeastofEden44** (7.5): Maybe the only sorta skip on the album, but Lizzo sells the absolute shit out of this track

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (7.5): i fuck w the feature

**akanewasright** (7): Gucci honestly drags the song’s energy down a lot.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): ft. Nicki Minaj

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Filler.

**hadea0090** (7): not as catchy but still good

**ignitethephoenix** (7): there’s a excellent song in here somewhere, but it’s just half baked

**jayjaysortagay** (7): this rate is hard cause is this an amazing song? Yes. Is it up to the standards of her other singles vocally, conceptually or production-wise? No.

**leviswift13** (7): okay now this one feels like fun by selena gomez which i know isn't nice but it's better at least

**rhyneston3** (7): Not the best, but not the worst

**shesdoingyoga** (7): Not a fan of whatever the sound that sounds like a kettle whistling is.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7): another catchy as fuck beat

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): kinda mid

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I FEEL

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): it needs some more melody for me. Gucci mane does nothing for me

**untutorable** (6.5): i love when she says "all my feelings gucci" and then laughs it's iconic but this song didn't need gucci mane on it like with most songs with gucci mane on them

**bandnitos** (6): it's not really my thing but it's catchy

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): It's not bad, just not that memorable.

**cashewconstellation** (6): Meh

**frogaranaman** (6): Tiktok type beat

**george\_kaito** (6): another bruno mars reject

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i feel like we forgot how “bitch i might be” was a gucci mane meme

**ManofOranges** (6): Don't really remember this song that well. It just kinda falls by the wayside. Meh.

**nick1372** (6): Catchy but basic

**skargardin** (6): remind me of why this okay-ish song was nominated for a grammy

**Stryxen** (6): this bridge is the only part of this song period

**vayyiqra** (6): gucci ganggucci ganggucci ganggucci ganggucci ganggucci ganggucci gang(gucci gang)

**E3-NotTheConvention** (5.5): Again, I think I'm not made for Lizzo's high energy

**radiofan15** (5.3): This is the most skippable song ever... and it's quite easy by shorter than 2:30 minutes

**bespectacIed** (5): very fun

**Kromorei** (5): i don't know what anyone rly expected from a lizzo vs gucci mane collab

**puberty1** (5): not bad, just very forgettable

**RandomHypnotica** (5): I listened to this album when it first came out but I have 0 memory of this songs existence

**alwayswords** (4): this was good until gucci mane showed up

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): kinda too repetitive

**nooodisaster** (4): The beat just kinda, happens. And then Gucci delivers a verse I swear is a 2 Chainz number.

**pearllouise** (4): This is one of the more forgettable tracks. At least it's nice to remind myself that Gucci Mane is still alive.

**waluigiest** (3): somehow this gets away with doing absolutely nothing

**vhqv1997** (0): Boredom and annoyance is exactly how I feel about this song

**wanderingimpromptu3** (0): Grating and unpleasant, repetitive and Gucci Mane isn’t good either

i mean, if they were friends great, i wont be mad about it, but still, fuck X

**TragicKingdom1 (8): SAD! still bops** *(ricki note: bolding this so u get dragged<3)*

**radiofan15** (7.5): Queen doing charity

**RosaPalms** (3): like all your friends are perfect (*ricki note: i mean they arent but none of them domestic abusers*)

**mudkip1** (1): honestly don't know if I'm rating this correctly. i hate xxx so im giving this a 1

#kids could you birghten up a little 

**twat\_brained** (10): giving this a 10 because to me it's the most pertinent and urgent of all these controversies. Billie needs to wise up and comprehend that Jahseh's female victims, of which there were many, all gave them their trust and broke down their boundaries around him. He took that trust and absolutely violated it. Why should Billie believe that she was no more at risk than the women X abused? Thousands of women in the U.S. alone die from domestic abuse each year. She can't continue mourning his death. Full offense.

**lilacsweetener** (9): Yeah...that genuinely sucks. But he had a vice grip on the teen audience that I just do not understand (and every time I ask they spit misogyny at me so uh...).

**bespectacIed** (8): People who are friends/family with awful people do this all the time, sadly, so although it's awful, it's kinda understandable. Especially for a young girl like her

**fadedblue09** (8): I think "support" is a very liberal way of putting it. "Sympathizing with his condition" is a more accurate description of it, and I'll just chalk it up to her juvenile naivety.

**hadea0090** (8): I know she was his friend and she wants to mourn him but like you can do that privately, you know? But then again she's friends with people who publicly support him as well so she might felt pressured to do the same.

**ReallyCreative** (6): I'm not expecting a teenager (she was like 16/17 at the time iirc) to have the most nuanced views in the world but come on girl, he was a monster.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): It's annoying but it didn't bother that much as I should? I just hope Billie comes to her sense at some point.

**vhqv1997** (5): I don't know about y'all, but it's not that easy as a 17-year-old to cut all emotional connection with somebody you consider friends even if you know that person does some heinous things

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (4): I didn't like him and thought the things he did were atrocious but if they were friends, they were friends. You really expect her to just suddenly shit on him after he died?

Ok this deserved **SO** much better. 

IDK how but this is fatphobic /s 

Lizzo came and gave you all SEX and SENSUALITY and SIN and you paid her back by giving her 48th place? Unforgiveable. 

---

**bespectacIed** (10): sex

**bulforster** (10): She has the range. The only moment of chill on the album and she knocks it out of the park.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): When this album first came out I was firmly against this song, I thought it was a boring song and a terrible closer, but it’s actually become one of my favorite songs on the record. It’s such a sultry, sexual song with a different energy than the rest of the songs that it serves as a necessary counterpoint, allowing us to take a glimpse at Lizzo after she gets home from partying and being a superstar and takes off her makeup, peels down to nothing, and waits in the heat like the rest of us.

**hunnybee12** (10): it's annoying she had to release the deluxe version because the orginal is so tight and ends on a perfect, blissful song

**kappyko** (10): mmmmmmmmmmm

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I love a good sex jam

**Tedyonce** (10): I know this song will be low but i love it

**avenueroy** (9.9): We as a society are sleeping on this song.

**1998tweety** (9.5): I'm surprised by how much I like this tbh. She is selling it HARD. Love the production on this.

**WeastofEden44** (9.3): Such a gorgeous deep cut, I love playing this song while sensually bathing

**akanewasright** (9): I forgot how goddamn good this song is.

**Anthony-Vince** (9): Kind of weird at first as the album closer, but I've grown to love it and I do think it's a beautiful track.

**dreamingoutloud92** (9): Who doesn’t love a slow banger after an energetic album?

**fadedblue09** (9): Wow! Probably my favorite slow song on this album. Very sensual and a good display of her voice and the instrumental is pretty nice.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): that slow jam energy, I felt a dick enter me from the ghost dimension listening to this song

**twat\_brained** (9): stripped back soul Lizzo is what this album needs more of

**vhqv1997** (9): This score is for using "crescendo" as a substitute for "climax"

**waluigiest** (9): horny rights horny rights. The second verse where it gets more frantic is so tasty. As an album closer, I hate how there’s no dead space at the end of the track. It goes suddenly into the deluxe tracks and is jarring

**Jimmy345960** (8.5): This would've been much lower but I'm glad I gave it a second chance

**meiscool132** (8.5): perfectly sultry imo

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I would like to hear more in this style from Lizzo, she does it well

**Stryxen** (8.5): a master lyricist “ahh. ahhh. AHHHHHH”. not sure it’s the best choice to end the standard album tho :/

**Mysario** (8.1): solid closer to the album and the lack of trap beats is a nice change of pace

**anagalisgv** (8): so sensual

**Awkward\_King** (8): when the tracklist came out we all thought the album was gonna end on a hype sex positive bop but this works so much better for a lizzo album thinking about it

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): A nice sexy closer

**cleen\_claire** (8): Thank you Lizzo, very cool!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): The entire album showcases how confident she is but this is definitely the song where she is the most confident. A perfect ender.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Grew on me a lot. Exceptional funky closer.

**george\_kaito** (8): boring but she served vocals pt 3

**JanuaryFourteenth** (8): Smoooooth Jazzzzzzz

**Johnnytoby** (8): oooh yes

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's an interesting ballad but it doesn't quite soar for me

**rsmitty99** (7.6): A slow jam, finally. The album may wanna use more of these to break up the constant hype. I felt like she just sprinted for 10 straight songs

**radiofan15** (7.5): Which Janet Jackson song is this?

**runaway3212** (7.5): Amazin sound

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): nothing but respect for the REAL album closer

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.5): This is a jam. I wish we'd gotten more slower songs

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): REAL THOT HOURS

**slazenger7** (7.4): Not my favorite song, but a NECESSARY change of pace.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): M'am, this is a Wendy's parking lot.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): kind of a snooze but I appreciated the sentiment

**ImADudeDuh** (7): oh damn

**nick1372** (7): LOVE to see this side of Lizzo let's see it more !!

**nooodisaster** (7): Kinda sad, kinda sexy.

**pearllouise** (7): The song that plays during an unnecessary sex scene in an action thriller

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (7): it's fine but why did she end the album with this song, she's climaxing and leaves us to clean ourselves up? selfish

**ladywolvs** (6.5): sry lizzo i want to love it

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): tbh i think this and Heaven Help Me should've switched places

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): it's not BAD, it's just so not as good as the rest of the album

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6): Now you got my attention! Not loving the lyrics, but I like her more in slow songs... Forget about it she is having an orgasm now

**leviswift13** (6): i really like the lower range of her voice. it feels natural and intimate and unguarded. i hope on her next project we get to hear this part of her voice more.

**rhyneston3** (6): I expected more from the title, oh well

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): i love the smooth instrumental but i don’t care much about what lizzo herself does with the song

**untutorable** (6): the most boring track on the album for me

**vayyiqra** (6): :flush:

**Kromorei** (5.5): mid

**bandnitos** (5): i don't really like it it's not a very strong closer

**hadea0090** (5): boringggg

**materialqirl** (5): uhm..

**Nickl00** (5): same problems I have with Jerome

**skargardin** (5): this song doesn't really sell the sex it's supposed to, a dud

**wasian-invasion** (5): it picks up a bit in the second half but still doesn’t really do it for me

**LeninaCrowne94** (4.2): Love the production but the lyrics are too much

**mayolizard** (4): honestly kinda boring..

**ggodisawomann** (3): I was so hype for this one based on title but it disappointed me

**ManofOranges** (3): My least favorite track on the album. I know I say a lot of shit about needing a more quiet track and now here I am saying that this isn't good but when I was talking about a quieter track I was talking about one that was also good.

**FluffyNobody** (1.5): I'd like to be excluded from this narrative

**NotWith10000Men** (1): sorry I hate songs like this sex is icky

Wailord: This is the point where Lizzo’s great lyricism and fun punchy lines are starting to get drowned out in the loud. The largest criticism I have for this album is just how similar the production sounds for some of the deeper cuts, and this unfortunately falls prey to this issue for me. 

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): third banger in a row? oh my lord this tracklist

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): COLORMECOLORMECOLORMECOLORME

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): YES, LIZZO, GO THE FUCK OFF!!!

**george\_kaito** (10): ok this is geniunely a bop!! it makes me smile

**hadea0090** (10): ended caucasians

**Jimmy345960** (10): best song on this album for me, i love how explosive this is

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Don't let the romantic cinephiles hear this

**bespectacIed** (9): Queen

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): She’s so fucking talented Jesus.

**rsmitty99** (9): Man are there really no skips on this album?

**Stryxen** (9): easily the most underrated song on the album. THAT is what she did.

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): lizzo really said fuck your "no rice no spice" grind profiles

**Mysario** (8.4): but this reminds me of some kind of classic rock melody but with a trap beat. and no, it's not because of that guitar

**1998tweety** (8): This is cute, wish it was longer though.

**bandnitos** (8): TRIPLETS BABEY

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): A-MEN girl!

**cleen\_claire** (8): Again, too short

**JanuaryFourteenth** (8): Rock guitar mixed with hip hop production is my kink

**jayjaysortagay** (8): bopbopbopbop

**meiscool132** (8): most of this song is unexpected and I think that makes for a really good listen

**pearllouise** (8): Lizzo singing "big dick energy" is what defines big dick energy

**skargardin** (8): bop!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): is that porn audio in the beginning

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): rainbows and shit

**vhqv1997** (8): The shouty chorus in this song is actually tolerable for me cause it's really short and almost the entire song is just bar after bar

**WeastofEden44** (7.8): A bop but it does feel a tinnnny bit non-essential,

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this album is much better than i gave it credit for on release i was disappointed how tf? there's barely a bad song here

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Not quite my thing but it's still good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caknmiIb2AA&frags=pl%2Cwn

**Nickl00** (7): SO loud

**nooodisaster** (7): chadMichaelsYES.gif I just wish this swapped time lengths with Heaven Help Me bc the message really deserves a longer song length.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): I can bop to it, it's just missing something

**runaway3212** (7): A bit to short but still pretty good.

**untutorable** (7): filler but this hook gets stuck in my head all the time

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I would have disliked this so much if anybody else were delivering these lines

**radiofan15** (6.2): God, what is with this album and having two easily skippable and way-too-short upbeat songs back-to-back?... At least the guitar is nice

**ggodisawomann** (6): pretty good

**kappyko** (6): yeah this is total fucking filler but i remember this very vividly

**Kromorei** (6): its ok

**wasian-invasion** (6): it's usually at this point where I go "wow this album is loud"

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): not a bad song but it's missing something

**E3-NotTheConvention** (5.2): Damn maybe I'll like this better at the gym?

**slazenger7** (5.2): Lyrics aren't for me.

**leviswift13** (5): again, this is a song that definitely exists. it was written and produced and recorded. probably even performed too.

**ManofOranges** (5): I think this song is cute but it simply just doesn't sound good enough for me to give it anything above a 5.

**puberty1** (5): good but kinda filler no?

**vayyiqra** (5): what Prince song is this

**waluigiest** (5): colormecolormecolorme

**fadedblue09** (4.5): The song structure reminds me more of a rap song. It's pretty interesting, but too fleeting to make a lasting impression.

**FluffyNobody** (4.5): I rapidly lost all the enthusiasm I had for this album

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): eh

**anothertown** (4): corny

**nick1372** (4): I am not the intended audience for this song so I may be missing something but I think it's too corny to really work

**rhyneston3** (4): I love how loud this album is, but it definitely needs a little bit of a breather and this would have been the perfect place for a ballad

**wanderingimpromptu3** (2.5): Too loud, grating

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is honestly already an xmas classic in my eyes i love this damn song

**ceebs\_** (10): absolute christmas bop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): It's amazing how this song took only a few days to complete, from songwriting to production! It really shows how much talent Taylor has. I really hope this could be at the same level as other Christmas classics like Mariah's All I Want for Christmas.

**moooo566** (10): i knew it was bad luck to listen to christmas music in the middle of the year and sure enough ive just knocked a glass of water over i hope you're happy op

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): in about 25 years this is gonna hit #1

**Mysario** (10): the best way to spread Christmas is cheer singing loud for all to hear

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is kinda weird considering I'm far removed from a Taylor stan but i really REALLY love this song

**rickikardashian** (10): **WE GET IT TAYLOR, YOU’RE IN LOVE AND THRIVING, DON’T RUB IT IN OUR FACES**

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Legit my favorite original Christmas song of the last decade or so

**Tolk1en** (10): litterally invented christmas. God what an amazing song. So many little treasures, references to classics.

**mms82** (9.8): I wish this song caught on more it's so cute and christmasy

**CritneySpearz** (9): it’s honestly a future christmas classic sorry h8rs

**fadedblue09** (9): Had low expectations considering her history of holiday music but it's surprisingly cute.

**FluffyNobody** (9): The intro is something I'd like Taylor do like for a full song, but even the rest is pure, unadulterated joy

**ladililn** (9): It’s hard to imagine any new song successfully breaking into the Christmas canon (All I Want for Christmas Is You is the most recent, right?), but if any song could I’d want it to be this one.

**leviswift13** (9): santa!

**nick1372** (9): In five years, this will be a classic Christmas song. Trust me.

**runaway3212** (9): It's not AIWFCIY, but it's a good attempt

**waluigiest** (9): I should have listened to this more when it came out. It’s just a solid Christmas song!!

**materialqirl** (8.5): ngl BOP

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): This is cute. It's not the best modern Christmas song but I could totally see myself adding this to my annual Christmas mix.

**cremeebrulee** (8): its cute. i wish it was more like the beginning (that deeper voice actually sounds amazing) but it still is a solid christmas song.

**eeveefan01** (8): Its cute

**franch** (8): i hate christmas music and yet i like this...

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I mean, it’s a Christmas song. “Cozy Little Christmas” outsold.

**Johnnytoby** (8): put this on my christmas playlist last year and no one noticed, a success!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): It’s no Santa Tell Me, but it’s pretty good

**nooodisaster** (8): you know what... this kinda snaps

**pearllouise** (8): Rupaul's fracking has probably left the farm in a lot of turmoil

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is cute, not groundbreaking for a Christmas song but does its job well

**wasian-invasion** (8): a solid christmas bop

**Mazike** (7.9): iconic christmas song

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.8): Nice christmas bop

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.8): So happy and adorable

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): so precious

**radiofan15** (7.5): Mariah remains unbothered

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's a pretty decent Christmas original, we'll see if it grows into the role of a perienneal classic

**slazenger7** (7.5): This is catchy but kitschy...as all great Christmas songs are.

**cleen\_claire** (7): This is cute

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): For when you're a holly jolly bitch, but no one will let you play Mariah Carey.

**ManofOranges** (7): I mean it's a cute christmas song and that's about all I have to say about it. It's obviously no All I Want for Christmas is You or anything but it's not abysmal.

**skargardin** (7): bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): why does this sound like a forgettable song in a christmas themed broadway show

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): i guess

**Agusarg** (6): Love the first 25 seconds for her voice alone, then it becomes a bit basic

**bandnitos** (6): no thoughts head empty

**bespectacIed** (6): cute but u'll never be mariah or ariana

**CarlieScion** (6): this is an okay Christmas song

**CreepyMannequin** (6): okay I HATE Christmas music but this actually nice

**hadea0090** (6): I don't celebrate christmas but I guess this is an alright christmas

**1998tweety** (5): I'm a big Swiftie but when a Taylor song needs a dragging, I will be there to do it. This is very meh. Sorry but it's actually embarrassing y'all made this go #1 on the sub.

**hockey\_newfoundland** (5): It's an ok Christmas song. Nothing special though

**jayjaysortagay** (5): nothing wrong with it but also why?

**Kromorei** (5): boring.

**mayolizard** (5): mmmmm overhyped

**meiscool132** (5): y'know, eh

**redgold51** (5): I forgot that you (this song) existed

**rhyneston3** (5): Ew farms

**wavingwolves** (5): while this is cute but i don't like christmas or christmas music

**dreamingoutloud92** (4): Call me a scrooge but I find most Christmas music irritating. This song is no different than any other generic Christmas song.

**sandyfishnets** (4): is it possible to have a pop overdose? this is what this song feels like

**alwayswords** (3): forgettable

**AnimationJava** (3): Tbh it's really hard for me to get into non-classic Christmas music.

**ggodisawomann** (3): this didn't hit for me

**avenueroy** (2.3): I was going to make a joke about all Christmas music being bad, but this was genuinely so much worse than I thought it would be.

**Nickl00** (2): I have something against this song for some reason idek

**puberty1** (2): strong case for atheism

**vhqv1997** (2): Lover is the only good Swiftmas song

**vayyiqra** (1): why can't I give a bonus track my 0 I hate Christmas music (yes really) and I hate this

Wailord: Like what many others have said below, this song is sometimes hard to grasp or listen to given the heavy contexts and themes present. 

All I will say regarding this song is that I think it handled the themes here seriously, maturely, and not done in any way to promote a state of mind or any actions. 

If you or anyone you know is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, please don’t hesitate to call or use the resources below:

**akanewasright** (11): I’m going to get dragged for this, but I really don’t care. [TRIGGER WARNING] I was considering suicide in late 2019. I was about to play the lead in my school’s winter play, so I knew I couldn’t, but I actually thought at some point “after this is over, I’m free to kill myself.” Honestly, this song made me feel less alone. I’ve uncontrollably cried to this song on my school’s bathroom floor. And honestly, people who criticize this song for glamorizing suicide or whatever are probably right, but... saying this song saved my life is melodramatic and probably not true, but it helped me work through a lot of difficult things without causing any harm to myself or others. I was going to give my 11 to Cruel Summer, but I can’t in good faith give my 11 to a delightful bop that I have a mild personal connection with when this song is right there.

**agentofscranton** (10): i love the sound of rain in the song. i love how cinematic it feels. i love this song.

**alwayswords** (10): the production on this is so beautiful wow

**AnimationJava** (10): Billie did a great job at addressing a heavy topic like suicide without romanticizing it nor watering it down.

**animefangrant62** (10): (As a 22 year old, I'd like to say this makes me nostalgic for my years of teenage angst, but it's hard to be nostalgic for something that isn't gone.)

**bandnitos** (10): this hit a little too close to home crying laughing emojis

**bulforster** (10): If this song ever plays on shuffle I always need to take a minute afterwards.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): the line "sorry won't save me now

**hadea0090** (10): This truly reads like a suicide letter 8

**radiofan15** (10): I'm just gonna score this one without even touching it again, because I don't want that kind of negativity on my life...

**runaway3212** (10): "Call my friend and tell them that I love them and I miss them, but I'm not sorry" is the best lyrics of 2019

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): goosebumps every time

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.5): A powerful suicide note. I'm really glad Billie is in a better place now

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): I heard this song for the first time while working packing orders in a warehouse and I literally stopped what I was doing so I could take it in so if you ordered a hoodie from the Sierra Nevada Brewery in December and it arrived a little late then that’s just this song’s #impact. But seriously as someone who’s struggled with suicidal tendencies (holla!) this song hits and I’m not entertaining any arguments.

**cleen\_claire** (9): i genuinely hope billie's okay

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Fuck, the sirens at the end.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The endless stream of "sorry" is tantalizing.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the details background in the production (like the sirens) makes it so haunting. This is just heartbreaking

**jayjaysortagay** (9): beautiful in every area

**NotWith10000Men** (9): I usually don't like super sparse songs like this but her voice is just so good and the lyrics make you want to listen more closely

**waluigiest** (9): gorgeous dark song and those deep synth bass hits are so TASTY

**wavingwolves** (9): i love the contrast between the piano and the distorted bass

**Stryxen** (8.5): I always forget what this sounds like but it also always leaves me in stunned silence

**Kanne\_** (8): it makes me uncomfortable at times but i like it

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Billie Eilish is honestly a fantastic singer good for her.

**WeastofEden44** (7.8): Very pretty but it gets old after a while imo

**1998tweety** (7): Nonevent

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): I like it.

**CritneySpearz** (7): this song feels like it lasts forever idk why...

**FluffyNobody** (7): It's a bit too mellow for my taste (and I'm a sad bitch)

**george\_kaito** (7): im shaking

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7): Stop apologizing Billie it’s okay 🥺

**leviswift13** (7): i appreciate how willing she is to go there.

**vayyiqra** (7): :worried: This song being about suicide makes it hard for me to listen to.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): i have a lot of complicated thoughts on the amount of suicide talk in billie’s music and its hard for me to articulate them well so i don’t wanna share them all here but it makes me very torn whether this song is any good or not

**Awkward\_King** (6): billie may as well have said "kill urself" :0

**Kromorei** (6): ok

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): Sorry to sound like a boomer, but... is Gen Z ok?

**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): the weakest ballad on the album

**pearllouise** (6): This is the song on the album you listen to and think "hmmm cool"

**rhyneston3** (6): Album starts to drag here

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6): A lovely song but verrrrry slow

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (6): she can pull off slow emotional songs, but this never really connected with me

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I appreciate the soulfulness but it drags on for too long. Also, there were some unnecessary noises I didn't like.

**slazenger7** (5.2): Snooze.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): lowkey makes me uncomfortable 13RW vibes

**ReallyCreative** (5): it's pretty but also pretty uninteresting

**wasian-invasion** (5): usually end up skipping this one

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (4): This was my contender for my 0. I really appreciate the honest songwriting but jeez, the suicide theme of this song made me feel uneasy, especially the sirens at the end. Note to self, don't listen to this song at my lowest point.

**Johnnytoby** (4): not much happens

**Nickl00** (4): it’s just wayyy to slow and usually that’s not an issue but I just can’t get into this

**rsmitty99** (4): Alright, first dud. Just slow and boring. Nothing too creative about this. The lyrics are dark and I can only assume it's about suicide so I gave it a few extra points on that. But still…meh

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (4): A little too slow and lethargic. The last four songs are all slow ballads and this is the weakest of the bunch

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): sorry but this is too boring

**bespectacIed** (3): this is so boring :(

**ggodisawomann** (3): eh

**ManofOranges** (3): I'm not gonna listen because this song bored me out of my mind. Just go already!

**nooodisaster** (3): I don't endorse this behavior.

**Mysario** (2.9): i came, i listened, i left

**MelodramaticLemonade** (2): While I appreciate Billie's attempt to capture and empathise with the vulnerable mindset of suicidal people, this song is so dreary it makes me want to fucking die. Quite ironic actually

**twat\_brained** (2): I love Billie but I really don't see the point of this track

**abysmalglimmer** (1): I don’t dislike this but I find it really hard to listen to

**Mazike** (0): I had to relisten to this to remember it and it was boring soo...

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Sending my love to you /u/akanewasright ❤️

Thank you for telling us why this song meant a lot to you. If anything, your 11 is not wasted here. Personally, I find the whole point of giving an 11 to a song is to show how much you love that song because you have a deep personal connection with it. 

Also, I agree that the song does not glamorize suicide. It's just Billie venting her thoughts and I am sure we had something like that at some point so she was just being singing about a topic that hits home harder than we would like to admit.  For personal reasons, I had to give this song a 4 (almost a 0) because it's so triggering. But it's a beautiful song nonetheless.

I hope you're doing much better mentally! Just remember people love you! ❤️❤️❤️

When Billie announced the tracklist,in between of making fun of the edgy lowercase *a  e  s  t  h  e  t  i  c*, there were already [comments concerned this song would be romanticizing the use of Xanax](https://i.imgur.com/FFJYZz5.png), but thankfully, instead we got the exact opposite, a dark ballad opposing to drug use. *xanny* is a very heavy song, not only because of the subject matter, but also the instrumental, that features almost front and center a simple bassline that gets distorted very heavily when the chorus hits. It’s purposely made to feel tense, just like feeling of being at a party where you don't feel completely comfortable, surrounded by loud speakers and intoxicated people, however, the intentional unpleasant vibe the song has comes with the expense of having a lot of people not enjoy it, lowering its average a fair amount.

---

**laurent1683** (11): These are the kind of chords and melodies that make me melt

**agentofscranton** (10): if flopheads' balladphobia does this song wrong i WILL fight

**anagalisgv** (10): idk why this song makes me cry

**bandnitos** (10): the distorted BASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK

**cashewconstellation** (10): Holy fuck, this has really grown on me. I don't know if it's because I personally relate to the lyrics, but, man, this song is amazing.

**george\_kaito** (10): say no to drugs kids!!

**hadea0090** (10): I love the jazzy tone of this song and the bridge is A+

**hawksband** (10): look how she ate that

**jayjaysortagay** (10): I relate so much to this, it's such a beautiful song about not fitting in and it manages to stay clear of "I'm not like other girls". The bass on the chorus kicks in and you're like 😯😯😯 the runner up for my 11.

**kappyko** (10): yes

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this song has a terrible message for the kids, have you heard of how Coca-Cola is bad for your health? smh this girl is a terrible role model

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): denouncing Xanax? We love to see it!

**radiofan15** (10): Love the quasy-jazzy vibe of the song... lyrics are as subtle as a brick on the face but if we dare to call Marina a good songwriter then we can also over-appreciate this little near-masterpiece

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): billie's seventeen and she's not on fire

**bulforster** (9.5): Don't do drugs kids.

**Agusarg** (9): Really cool production

**alwayswords** (9): did more for addiction than d.a.r.e.

**AnimationJava** (9): I think people don't talk enough about the fact that Billie has a massive army of young fans and she released a great song about not taking Xanax. I respect the message of the song a lot.

**frogaranaman** (9): Billie's overall aesthetic really does shine through in the music video for this song. absolutely grim yet thoughtful

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I remember when everyone saw the track list for this album we were worried about this song because a lot of kids around her age glorify abusing prescription drugs, but I’m glad it turned out to be the exact opposite. She makes being depressed and surrounded by drugged up people sound horrible! I like how *scary* this song sounds with the sudden bass and the twisted vocals, it’s unusual for a mainstream pop star that sounds this weird and unpleasant.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): god all her shit sounds so perfectly weird

**RandomHypnotica** (9): this song would be perfect without the unneccesarily long outro

**runaway3212** (9): I really dislike the 'not like other girls' vibe in this song, but god do I love the production, nothing sounds out of place.

**wavingwolves** (9): drugs? NOOO!!! just real vibezzz (i really support the message of this song)

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I remember people first dragged this for being called xanny but did they even listen to the lyrics? I think this is one of the more over hated songs here and it does not deserve to be

**twat\_brained** (8.6): the times last year when I'd hop in my car and just have this on… exquisite. The video, however, was somewhat pointless.

**Kanne\_** (8.5): i like it cause i lowkey relate to it oops

**puberty1** (8.5): the fact that Billie made a song called "xanny" and it's actually really good and only a little bit cringe is one of her biggest achievements

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): Deeply underappreciated on this sub

**ReallyCreative** (8.1): love the effects of this song, it just goes on a little too long

**anothertown** (8): I can’t afford to love someone who isn’t dying by mistake!!!!!!! In silver lake!!!!!!!!!

**axestogrind** (8): Listening to this with car speakers... life-changing

**cleen\_claire** (8): finneas' production is fucking stunning

**fadedblue09** (8): I'll give her points for tackling such an unusual subject, even though I'm not fond of the song overall.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8): i, too, like singing into a fan

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8): something a little unsettling listening to a 17 sing about xanax but she pulls it off

**Stryxen** (7.9): the vocoder and the beat are hypnotic, but the song starts to overstay its welcome without doing anything else. I will still be streaming this however

**Mysario** (7.8): pretty glad Billie made it so searching "xanny" gets you this on the internet now. now for all of our sakes, who's gonna release a smash hit called "Blue Waffle"?

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.5): I'm not feeling that chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): billie said FUCK DRUGS and she’s right!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): i have mixed feelings about this song. while i think that billie did a good job in discussing a complicated topic without sounding too holier than thou, i’m still unsure that she knows what she’s talking about when it comes to drugs and addiction. at the end of the day though, it’s a good, important song, and the bass absolutely goes.

**untutorable** (7.5): as someone who resisted being medicated and had a lot of insecurity about it for much of my life that "don't give me a xanny to feel better" really hits. i'm not sure if the song is meant to be quite THAT heavy but i found myself moved by it anyway

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): I'm not a big fan of the boosting, sorry. Lyrics are good, tho.

**cremeebrulee** (7): i like the message but as a song it’s just something i wouldn’t revisit

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Given how much pop culture has glorified drug use more than ever, Billie is trying to send a message against it. It's a bit preachy, especially in the second verse but I appreciate her for sending a much-needed message.

**FluffyNobody** (7): The effect in the chorus is nails on a chalkboard, but that's apparently what they wanted to achieve, so

**ladywolvs** (7): i like it but i have to be in the right mood to listen? otherwise the vocal effects are fuckin annoyin

**mayolizard** (7): i wish there was more from the verses

**meiscool132** (7): I really like how the production reflects the inebriation and the party aspect, and it gives me 'here' by Alessia Cara vibes, and idk if that's good or bad

**nick1372** (7): sometimes we need songs like this to remember that billie is actually a very nice person

**Nickl00** (7): this song actually has a good message, and the vocal effects are kinda cool

**rhyneston3** (7): What is a xanny? is it Xanax? They have the same amount of syllables I hate that. Song gets docked a point because of it

**rsmitty99** (7): Hoping we get more than just minimal songs with some strong bass lines through the rest of this album. It does pick up by the end.

**waluigiest** (7): this song is like if bad guy was less focused

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): love the beat, and the vocals are great. unfortunately i can't hear them for half the song.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): as much as drinking canned coke is relatable i never liked this song as much as i wanted to

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.2): This would be so much better if it weren't so 'experimental'

**akanewasright** (6): I’m not sure how I feel about the song.

**Evanbrooks324** (6): it's alright but not a huge fan of it

**pearllouise** (6): idk what she is saying but I am living

**skargardin** (6): there are parts of it that i enjoy, such as the vocal distortion but overall, it's not all that

**wasian-invasion** (6): i get the sentiment but still seems kinda a bit smug. also the distortion really grates

**slazenger7** (5.7): Disappointingly overproduced and melodically dull.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (5): It sounds pretty good. But man I wonder if her family is ever deeply worried about her?

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Always had a distate for this song. The bass is cute, but overall xanny leaves an iffy impression on me.

**JMez2613** (5): I have literally no opinions on this song so I have to give it a middle score by default

**leviswift13** (5): it feels like a scary tik tok to me.

**nahaalne** (5): the production makes me uncomfortable idk why

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.1): this draaaaaaags

**JanuaryFourteenth** (4): I think it’s slow on purpose but idk it’s still kind of a slog

**nooodisaster** (4): This song is not worth me getting a migraine.

**mms82** (3.5): ballad billie only occasionally strikes a winner and this ain't it

**bespectacIed** (3): this is awful

**franch** (3): this song is 4 minutes going on 40

**TiltControls** (3): i love the idea of the distortion, but my ears still hate it

**vayyiqra** (3): While I agree that abusing prescription medication is bad, especially highly dangerous drugs like benzodiazepines, this song is also too slow, meandering, and boring, and the distortion is awful.

**1998tweety** (2): Nope, sorry this ain't good. Don't think she should be romanticizing drug use either oop *(ricki’s note:...but she isn’t)*. This is such a slog to get through, especially right at the start of the album...It's a shame cause there are some really good instrumentation here but everything else is awful.

**ggodisawomann** (2): not fa me

**Kromorei** (2): why did they make this garbage song a single

**vhqv1997** (2): Listening to this song is the equivalence of watching your sister cry because she accidentally burned her chicken tenders and felt the overwhelming guilt of all her past failures collapse onto the blackening poultry corpse. Like, you feel bad cause she probably has legit reasons to have a mental breakdown, but still, it's a chicken, you can just order takeouts.

**ManofOranges** (1): I don't really understand what's going here and I have no reason to want to. I do need a xanny to get me through this damn song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this is nothing

**shhhneak** (0): sorry but this production hurts my ears, yes I'm 84 years old.

**1998tweety** (10): Surprisingly, I love it. She pulls this off well.

**cyborglilith** (10): iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i watched Cats and honestly i actually do like this song now ajsdnksjdvf

**leviswift13** (10): deserves better than it got

**pearllouise** (10): Oscar robbed

**radiofan15** (10): The best Taylor song since 1989. Underrated. A future classic. Gorgeous. Iconic. Deserved an Oscar. If this was on the main rate it would be my 11

**rhyneston3** (10): This deserves a zero for being attached to Cats, but it also deserves a 10 for being attached to Cats

**TiltControls** (10): The one good thing to come out of Cats

**waluigiest** (10): I must give this a 10 because I love Cats!!! T.S. Elliot stands for Taylor Swift. We should also have rated her version of Macavity :/

**wavingwolves** (10): taylor semi british accent in this kind of sends me

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): she was robbed at the Golden Globes and robbed of an Oscar Nomination.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Of course, Taylor knows how to write a great ballad. Taylor should probably try to write a musical and go for the Tonys. I am sure Boardway will welcome Swift with open hands because the autobiographical nature of her lyrics would mesh well with the theaterical nature of boardway.

**franch** (9): it was worth the movie's existence for this

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): im j saying if they kept the release of cats to be this year this probably would've gotten oscar consideration due to the small pool im just saying

**FluffyNobody** (8.5): Probably the only good thing to come out of Cats

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I didn’t actually see Cats so I have no idea if there is a reason for her to change some of her pronunciations but I don’t like that she does. Also I don’t remember enjoying this one this much when it came out

**Mysario** (8.3): SHOW US THE BUTTHOLE CUT OF THE MOVIE

**slazenger7** (8.3): Beautiful but a bit slow.

**Mazike** (8.1): underrated

**ceebs\_** (8): wow that note at the end

**jayjaysortagay** (8): Shats (2019) didn't deserve the energy Taylor put into this. Better than most of the songs on Lover honestly.

**materialqirl** (8): movie sucked though

**patcheso8** (8): a GOOD addition to the CATS movie

**rickikardashian** (8): chonces

**ladililn** (7.5): Knocked down half a point for “chonces."

**PointlessBibliophage** (7.5): the greatest thing about this song is that it isn't the one where rebel wilson takes off her fursuit and bites a cockroach's head off

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.1): I LOVE everything about the verses: production, melody, lyrics. It’s haunting and beautiful. The chorus isn’t really working for me in comparison, too plain and bombastic

**Agusarg** (7): The only decent thing to come out of Cats

**fadedblue09** (7): I guess her performance is surprisingly nice here.

**hadea0090** (7): better than most of lover

**lapascalia** (7): She sounds great but I don’t understand the English accent that comes out in parts of the song?!?

**letsallpoo** (7): why does this kinda go off

**meiscool132** (7): I'm yet to watch cats and i'm scared

**puberty1** (7): I honestly wanted to watch Cats in a cinema but it was showing here like only the week of Christmas literally so I can't make a funny joke about it because I haven't watched it yet. song is not bad though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): insert haha cats bad comment here

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it is fine not much more to say

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): why did she do this again

**J\_Toe** (6): remind that buttholes were edited onto and then out of the 2019 version of Cats. Meaning somewhere out there exists a half-way version of this cursed movie even worse than the one we got.

**ManofOranges** (6): I don't understand why Taylor would be in Cats in the first place. Did she want her own like Shallow moment or something? If she did... this is not the song for that. It's fine but it's not noteworthy. I don't get the point of it.

**mayolizard** (6): this wasnt really memorable

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): Not Bad

**nooodisaster** (6): by far the best thing to come from Cats (2019).... im giving this a 6.

**runaway3212** (6): I guess it's not the worst song ever.

**vhqv1997** (6): Mrs. Swift just doesn't have the pipes to pull off a power ballad of this caliber, shame too because it's actually really well-written

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.8): This style doesn't suit her voice or lyrics. Also it's hard to take this seriously with that single cover

**bandnitos** (5): not a musical theater person

**bespectacIed** (5): This is a cute song but we all know T's not a musical calibre of a vocalist. She sounds so strained and shaky

**CarlieScion** (5): this is cute but also its from cats. Fuck cats.

**skargardin** (5): this has the potential to be something but it never takes off. her vocals are quite good here though

**jackisboredtoday** (4.6): bless her heart bc she’s trying here but Taylor’s voice isn’t well suited to this accent or to the big money note at the end (still better than almost anything else in Cats though)

**alwayswords** (4): this is pretty i guess

**AnimationJava** (4): The high note is the main redeeming part of this song.

**LesApfels** (4): It’s basically a shittier version of Memory and Taylor doesn’t even sing it in the movie

**wasian-invasion** (4): chauuunces

**WeastofEden44** (4): This doesn't work either as a pop song or a musical theatre number. I really expected more from this song and Taylor didn't have the vocal chops to make the material seem better than it is.

**cleen\_claire** (3): Oscar bait and it didn't even get a nomination we love to see it

**ggodisawomann** (3): not fa meeee

**Kromorei** (3): i love cats

**nick1372** (3): I forgot Taylor was in Cats that seems so fake?? Also she sounds terrible.

**Nickl00** (3): it’s better than the movie at least

**TragicKingdom1** (3): this is what i imagine every song in the theoretical broadway rate sounds like

**Ghost-Quartet** (2.5): Let me dig up my review from the Jukebox - The thing about Andrew Lloyd Webber is that he's very good at writing songs that sound pretty but are low-key empty schmaltz. He's the "mom pop" of the theatre world, huge with the GP but many dedicated theatre fans probably roll their eyes at the mention of him. (See also: Pasek & Paul) The only reason he's been able to get away with the career that he has is because of his ability to write songs that overwhelm you with their sheer power and this... does not. Webber's music has been diminishing returns for years now and this song just feels like a shadow of what he's done at his peak. It's aimlessly meanders without any memorable hooks or melodies; with apologies to Jerry Herman, I guess the hummable tune really is dead. It's unfair to criticize the lyrics because when set to music like this they never had a fighting chance but they're just as trifling as the melody. At least when he was working with Tim Rice the lyrics were campy. I'd mention Taylor's vocal performance, but I don't want to be mean. This is the kind of song that stops a show cold in the worst way. It's up there with the likes of "Suddenly" from Les Miserables or "Surprise, Surprise" from A Chorus Line as a song clearly shoehorned into the film just for awards consideration and you know what? It'll probably win an Oscar. Enjoy it you two, I hope it was worth it.

**frogaranaman** (2): why do we delude ourselves into thinking this was anywhere near decent

**muchopartymuchomoney** (2): yawn

**vayyiqra** (2): wtf is this Disney ballad shit oh wait it's from Cats lmao anyway it's boring

**mms82** (1): might be the worst song taylor ever released?

**sandyfishnets** (1): I still need to watch Cats

For the longest time, ME! was sporting the highest controversy score in the rate, but then came the rest of the 0’s for 7 Rings. 

7 Rings absolutely deserves any of the criticism it gets. It’s loud, the lyrics aren’t great, Ariana rapping should get the criticism Taylor gets for rapping (both deservedly so), the whole Asian/Black cultural backlash is all up for discussion but that’s covered in our bonus rate so I won’t go into it here. The entire song is just surrounded in mess, and *unfortunately* the song also is catchy as hell. For the longest time this was safely in day 2, and suddenly Ricki and I were watching it close to see if it would sneak into day 1 or not, and boom, now we’re here. 

---

**Tolk1en** (11): I still don't understand why popheads hate this song. I love every single second of this song. The beat, the rhythm, the voice, the bridge. I'm not convinced at all by the music video. This song really started my absolute love for this album and overall for this era

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): BANGER BANGER BANGER

**AnimationJava** (10): A masterpiece, I'll never forget how hard this song bops.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): A song that I feel like people take too seriously? Obviously, it's supposed to be fun and lighthearted, but there's also this air of sadness with the instrumentals that makes the song deeper than it initially appears. Either way, it's a catchy bop and I'm pretty sure it's my most played song of 2019

**cashewconstellation** (10): Ariana MIGHT not be able to pronounce words, but the song is good

**DaHumanTorch** (10): why do people hate this. why. it’s so good it’s so fun. people are mad this is a flex anthem but don’t keep the same energy for male artists like the weeknd. it even has a deeper context within the album which people claim is a stretch but then they go and analyze fence holes on taylor’s instagram. pls. y’all just hate fun

**eeveefan01** (10): i want it, i got it

**Evanbrooks324** (10): a bitch bop and idc what y'all think about the lyrics i love it

**franch** (10): how perfect can it get with this weird cover

**ggodisawomann** (10): bop bop bop also grew on me

**GoatButton** (10): I'm so sorry

**hikkaru** (10): 10 rings

**Jimmy345960** (10): Makes me feel like a bad bitch

**Johnnytoby** (10): went to a club during pride week and when this played, whew chile, YUH

**laurent1683** (10): The fact that some people still don't understand what this song is about...

**materialqirl** (10): DO DO DO DO DO DODO DO DO DODO

**mayolizard** (10): lastfm says i have 777 plays of this song so of course it's fate my most played song x

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I WANT IT I GOT IT I WANT IT I GOT IT

**rsmitty99** (10): This shouldn't work. This should be a dumb song. This Pretty Boy Swag spinoff should be written off. Yet here we are, still referencing this song and bopping to it. This album is FILLED with hip hop beats and flows and the bridge here is probably the best attempt.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): i didn't like it at first but it's one of my most played from last year. it's just so fun and catchy and follows up Ghostin' and In My Head perfectly

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): a lot of people seemed not to appreciate this side of ariana but i think the song slaps from the first second to the last. ari hip hop album when?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i love when ariana calls me out for being a broke bitch

**Mysario** (9.7): ###Stop ###Being ###Poor

**hawksband** (9.5): she remembered who she was and the game changed

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): Delicious ear candy, bridge is amazing

**wardrum5** (9.5): When will this sub accept that this song is amazing and her biggest hit? (Straight people have never heard Greedy)

**alwayswords** (9): ariana grande could wash tupac

**bbfan132** (9): i’m sorry but this is a total bop and people take it way too seriously…

**CarlieScion** (9): I literally do not care that this song is disgustingly capitalist and a celebration of wealth that Ari didn’t hustle for, but was low-key born into. This bops. You can all suck it.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I went from seeing this as a guilty pleasure to really love this song. Considering that most of the album is low-key, it needs an upbeat trap-rap song to complement the dark vibe of the record and "7 rings" is the perfect song for that.

**george\_kaito** (9): a bad bitch anthem

**ignitethephoenix** (9): a bop idc, idc just let me live and turn up to this materialism anthem

**jayjaysortagay** (9): I'm a socialist so I should hate this but I think people have purposely misinterpreted this as being primarily a consumerist song. I think it's about the joys of friendship after tragedy and getting lost in hedonism, the other stuff is just fun to add to the vibe.

**Kromorei** (9): unironic masterpiece

**ManofOranges** (9): Personally, I actually really like this song. In terms of just the sound itself, it's catchy and I like it and that's really all it takes for me to enjoy something, so here I am. As far as lyrics, this song is without a doubt vapid, to the point of me thinking "seriously?!" to myself when I listen. It does have just a bit of "why don't you just be rich?" type of feel. Also, if she really writes her own checks like she writes what she sings, that must mean the only thing she writes on her checks is the signature.

**mudkip1** (9): i feel like a kardashian listening to this

**Nickl00** (9): a classic

**pearllouise** (9): Fun fact: Each ring represents all the artists that accused her of copying this song

**RosaPalms** (9): ariana black

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This song is nowhere close to bad, you guys just don’t know how to have fun

**vhqv1997** (9): This song is good, but mostly thanks to the "the way it shiiiiiiiiiiines" line

deleted: **Awkward\_King** (8.5): fuck all y'all ariana is a CAPITALIST and PROUD

**meiscool132** (8.5): Ariana run pop AND rap.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): my favorite controversial bop highlighting the hollowness of capitalistic consumerism

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.3): The most ‘problematic’ thing about this song is how underappreciated it was

**1998tweety** (8): Ok I know this isn't that good but there are some songs I'll excuse solely cause of the energy they give off (LWYMMD and half of Nicki's discog). I wanna defend this song and say that the lyrics obviously aren't serious, but tbh knowing Ari, I'm not 100% sure.

**agentofscranton** (8): y'all do much on this song honestly. it's just a fun song.

**anagalisgv** (8): rapriana rises

**bandnitos** (8): you guys don't know how to have fun

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): The moon is high like your friends were the night that we first met.

**fadedblue09** (8): Another overhated bop. It’s not as good as the album highlights, but at least has far more interesting lyrics to offer.

**nooodisaster** (8): Where do I even begin? Do I give this my 0 or my 11? Somehow both seem equally viable.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): This is such a bop, I don't care what you broke woke people think. Julie Andrews sample is simply brilliant

**WeastofEden44** (8): I really like this song but the capitalist thinkpieces done for it were both kinda valid and kinda missed the point of the song imo

**cyborglilith** (7.5): once I realized "ATM machines" was wrong...

**bespectacIed** (7): insert popheadscirclejerk joke

**cleen\_claire** (7): i hate that i like this so much

**cremeebrulee** (7): seems appropriate

**rhyneston3** (7): Julie Andrews was a badder bitch

**skargardin** (7): banger

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6.9): Nor for me

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): I wish she let Max add an actual hook to this song because if it had that this could be the most stupid fun a big star had released in years instead of the meh song it ended up

**akanewasright** (6.5): This song doesn’t deserve my streams. And yet it receives it anyway. Actually, fuck it, that bridge is good.

**Kanne\_** (6.5): i cant take this song seriously anymore take my 6.5 and let me alone sksksk

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): maria von trapp still reigns superior

**puberty1** (6.5): when this song was released, i hated it. a lot. i honestly even thought that if i was ever gonna rate this song here, it would get my 0 pretty easily. but damn, I absolutely love the instrumentals.

**runaway3212** (6.5): I wish I could say I hated this song, but it's not that bad.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): Controversy aside, its kind of dumb.

**bulforster** (6): I've never understood people saying it makes sense in the context of the album as describing a coping mechanism for depression, this is in the triumphant portion of the album after the emotional climax of ghostin and self-reflective resolution of in my head so it's still just a kind of out of touch flex. It's a catchy one though.

**nick1372** (6): The """""cultural appropriation""""" accusations were maybe a bit much, I do think that Ari deserves some credit for making this song alongside women of color, and that's why it has the influences that it has. However, is it good enough to warrant a full defense of it? absolutely not

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I still love the favorite things melody but the rest of it is just… there.

**twat\_brained** (6): I'm too tired to get into the discourse, I just want to see this be the first single out

**lilacsweetener** (5): I loooove the production and a female artist finally doing the type of flex expected primarily of men but there’s obviously not much else going on here. Nor does there need to be.

**plantp0wer** (5): bidness card..

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (5): some days this song is a 10 and other days it's a 0

**avenueroy** (4.2): At least the production is solid.

**anothertown** (4): i just watched gaga singing the sound of music medley for the 100th time and it still was incredible

**RandomHypnotica** (4): i certainly don't hate this song as much as I did when it first came out, but I still don't really vibe with it, and it still feels REAL outta place on the album

**ReallyCreative** (4): I love the lyrics and concept of the song, but it is just not enjoyable to listen to

**Stryxen** (3.5): this goes off but I lowkey hate it

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I’m just glad I was out of high school theatre by the time this came out. I find it really annoying but I must admit, she made the “My Favorite Things” sample sound really cool even if the rest of the song is #notgood.

**abysmalglimmer** (2): not sold on this- I’m driving Cadillacs in my dreams

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): sometimes this goes off and sometimes it's annoying and embarrassing as hell and guess which one it is right now

**dreamingoutloud92** (2): Ugh, get tf out of here with this trash.

**FluffyNobody** (2): I know it comes from a place of "let me throw money at my problems" but God, it's so shallow, and it was everywhere, so I started hating it while knowing all the lyrics. Also, "write my own checks like I write what I sing"/ "They stack up like my ass"? Guuuurl are you saying you're poor

**frogaranaman** (2): one time while in Europe for my study abroad, I met up with my European friend and his friends at a bar before we went to this club which happened to be one of the bougiest in the city. turns out my friend's friend knows someone who knows someone who is super rich and got us into the VIP part of the club. we get down there and the group is having some of the most expensive and finest alcohol I have ever seen in my life, I'm talking like £350 champagne bottles expensive. anyways the reason this is related to "7 rings" is because I had like three shots of Grey Goose by Ducasse to a remix of this song

**JanuaryFourteenth** (2): I’m just glad Ariana’s got more rings than Tom Brady the cheating bastard

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): Do I think it's ironic? Yes. Does that make me like it? No.

**gannade** (1): eat the rich

**hadea0090** (1): why is this even on here. Doesn't even fit in the album imo.

**wavingwolves** (1): i can't take songs like this coming from white millionaires. thank you, NEXT!!! to this song

deleted: **animefangrant62** (0): (It was neck and neck between London Boy and this for my 0 and this just barely won out as I was forced to listen to it because it was such a giant hit. Thank god everybody else agreed London Boy sucked.)

**ImADudeDuh** (0): lemme copy my comment from the decade end rate - 7 Rings is terrible. Ariana has made amazing songs. She’s made some of the best pop songs of the 2010s. She doesn’t use any of her talents on this song. On an album that has her trying to overcome sadness, why is she trying to flex on us how we aren’t as rich as her? [EDIT: Having listened to the album back to back again, i still don’t see the reason for this. “Retail therapy” doesn’t justify it’s placement in the album.] People keep trying to just brush it off as “a fun bop that isn’t that deep!” which is true, but it’s also annoying as hell and with such an unlikable attitude. “Whoever said money can't solve your problems/Must not have had enough money to solve 'em” is one of the worst lyrics of the decade and is such a slap in the face to anyone who has ever struggled with money. There are ways to brag about money and make it seem fun, but having a white woman who’s never had to really “work” for her wealth rap about how much richer she is than I, is not fun. This song really marked the point when I think Ariana just became a bad artist. Add all this up with her blackfishing scandal (which considering THIS is currently her spotify picture, she doesn’t give a fuck about), and you get a song that i think has 0 redeeming qualities.

**kappyko** (0): no

**leviswift13** (0): i hate this song. i absolutely despise it. this, and the closer, completely ruin the arch of the album. it's just so fucking shallow and empty and vapid.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (0): This song is cold and isolating and goes against everything emotive and uplifting about the rest of the album. I still don't know who exactly this song is for other than Ariana Grande herself

**muchopartymuchomoney** (0): bragging in a song can be done well and sound empowering, but here it just sounds petty and arrogant, especially the infamous "whoever said money can't solve your problems must not have had enough money to solve 'em" line. and lol at her trying to come off as a badass or a "savage", and attempting to pull off being a singer/trap rapper hybrid. it's just boring and unconvincing. it was hard to choose between this or wish you were gay for my zero, but this one somehow annoys me more.

**NapsAndNetflix** (0): i hate literally every single aspect of this song it is the worst hit that has happened in YEARS

**radiofan15** (0): I've seen some people arguing that this song is meant to represent Ariana's unhealthy coping mechanisms following her multiple and very public tragedies, and I would sympathize with that mindset... if the song wasn't mostly a shallow and vapid flex anthem that also happens to destroy the much-superior song it samples (Rodgers and Hammerstein sweeties, I'm so sorry...) and very much kills the somewhat efficient mood the album was carrying at the moment. THANK U, NEXT INDEED

**selegend** (0): i hate white women

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): this is my least favorite song of all time

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): people who enjoy this frighten me

**TiltControls** (0): it tried. Honestly though I think it was an interesting idea, but the execution did not pay off - especially the lyrics and enunciation

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i see no reason to further contribute to the discourse surrounding this song

**vayyiqra** (0): (Yuh.) Ew. I can't even enjoy this bizarre, tacky song by imagining I'm a rich bish. Everything about it annoys me, and building a pop song around a melody from The Sound of Music has only been done once in history successfully (Gwen Stefani's weird banger "Wind It Up") and the cosmos will not allow it to happen again.

**waluigiest** (0): this song is still anti-black

the tan was questionable, but the hair line was completely understandable, homegirl hasn't wore her hair naturally since her career started

#ariana black

**fadedblue09** (1): While I don't condemn her for this, it birthed a lot of unfunny "Ariana black" jokes that I hope we never see again.

**Mazike** (11): at least the memes are funny

**hadea0090** (10): we didn't grow up watching victorious in my country and until I started using twitter I thought ariana was latina...

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): those phcj memes will never die

**leviswift13** (9): ariana black!!

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): giving /r/popheadscirclejerk the mediocre humor it's needed to stay alive for many months

**radiofan15** (1): I can't believe she's cosplaying as Idris Elba!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): ariana black

#aryana grande

**ImAMessyBitchDuh** (11): she's fucking cancelled sis

**jimmy345960** (10): idk know what to rate this as a white person, i let other people determine this

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the mental gymnastics from her fans truly snapped

**meiscool132** (9): just yikes

**puberty1** (9): i feel like her tanning wont age well at all. people in the future will be like "damn y'all let this happen?"

**runaway3212** (9): entertaining, juicy though I wish she wouldn’t have

**twat\_brained** (8.3): now this I think deserved attention because black folx, especially womxn, constantly have their ideas appropriated and watered down by white people who take all the credit for something they didn't create. We should be discouraging this behaviour.

**anothertown** (6.5): Some of the girls out here still cannot handle this one. I don't rate this very high due to racism and a clear right/wrong but the fact that it still inspires infighting does say something about it.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (5): It caused a debate at the time but everyone forgot about it

**vhqv1997** (4): Blackfishing is an error on her part, but the wacky eyeroll-worthy memes that people made out of this were even worse

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (3): I'm not looking to get into a whole thing with this so I'll just simply say this whole thing was overblown and I don't believe this is a case of Blackfishing.

**LeninaCrowne94** (3): Hasn't she always been accused of blackfishing?

**1998tweety** (1): i hate this racist blackface bitch

**bespectacIed** (1): Hmmm the only downside of me stanning Ari is the fact that i can't justify this. This is wrong, and I continue being a hypocrite for still stannig her despite of this behavior.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (1): This is definitely a serious discourse and I understand why black women are hella pissed. It seems Ariana is slowly responding to this criticism by not.....looking too tanned to the point of blackfishing I guess?

**lilacsweetener** (0): wasn’t it thank you next music video? Because people didn’t realise it was just the platinum blonde wig emphasising her fresh tan? 🙄

I don’t think this is homophobic, but it *is* boring. Stripped down production Billie is often great, but I don’t think she hit the mark on this one. It seems a bit directionless, and the melody feels a little forced. 

It feels right to be out at this point, right after 7 Rings, which should serve as the benchmark for this rate. “Was it better or worse than 7 Rings?” 

---

**hadea0090** (10): I love everything ftom the production to the lyrics to her voice

**kappyko** (10): this isn't homophobic get over it

**radiofan15** (10): me to 90% of my crushes...

**rhyneston3** (10): This is the most Gen Z song I've ever heard. Good job zoomers

**runaway3212** (10): I love the counting down in this song

**fadedblue09** (9.5): The most fun track on the album so far. Definitely a cute reinvention of a friendzoning song

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): queen of counting down

**alwayswords** (9): the counting in the lyrics :mastermind:

**bandnitos** (9): as a gay i allow this

**cleen\_claire** (9): break my heart billie go on

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Ur So Gay by Katy is shaking tbh. I think people calling Billie homophobic for this song are kinda ridiculous. She is very much aware that wishing her love interest to be gay is quite selfish. Her honest and self-aware songwriting is what I love about this song. It almost sounds like Taylor would write this song during her debut days. (Picture to Burn teas)

**jayjaysortagay** (9): god I've changed so much over the last year when I first heard this I was like "umm problematic sweaty" and its really not. Its honest and really relatable. Love the background vocals.

**ladililn** (9): times you never made it there

**leviswift13** (9): okay i think this song is hysterical and actually very clever. anyone who doesn't get it doesn't deserve to get it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): another grower. i did not care for this when it came out, but i love it now.

**waluigiest** (9): I love this so much. While I was disappointed that she wasn’t gay and yearning, it’s still a self-aware bop (see “I’m so selfish but you make me feel helpless”)

**Johnnytoby** (8.8): same

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): Possibly my favorite from this album? I'd like to see the production soar a little more towards the end but she's a bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): popheads when Shawn and Charlie is take their shirts off and/or are soaking wet

**mms82** (8.5): peak ballad billie

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.4): Yes, some lyrics are cringey but that countdown is kinda interesting. Love that slow beat.

**Mysario** (8.4): consider this - if it weren't for straights, we wouldn't have a Kenny Chesney number one album in 2020!

**1998tweety** (8): I'm conflicted about this. I think I like it a fair bit. I don't wanna deal with the essays on this one please.

**Anthony-Vince** (8): Catchy song, and I like the lyrics, but I don't think it's one of her best

**hawksband** (8): im gay

**ManofOranges** (8): I remember there being a small bit of people making a stink about the name of this song or something like that I think? I can't quite remember but I'm pretty sure that happened. Anyways, I also wish guys were gay, but not because it would soften the blow of rejection. I wish so for different reasons if you know what I mean.

**nooodisaster** (8): Relatable for the opposite reason ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**rsmitty99** (8): The title of this song is the title of my memoir in high school. Ah…Jake Willen.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I never really understood the controversy over the lyrics, the meaning is pretty apparent. However, this production should have been used on a different song

**Stryxen** (8): if I hadn’t overplayed this when it came out, I’d probably like it more.

**wasian-invasion** (8): wow this is teen energy if i've ever felt it

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8): something about wishing your crush gay to make yourself feel better is clunky, but it doesn't stop her from going off

**Kanne\_** (7.7): would have a higher score if i wasn't iffy about the "wish you were gay"

**twat\_brained** (7.7): i do not fucking want to see this on day 1 this is not a late-2000s Katy song

**FluffyNobody** (7.5): I do like the ballad style of this, it's just not my favourite

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It’s a little #problematic but what saves this song for me is the air of shame it has. I get the sense that Billie understands how selfish and juvenile the sentiment she’s singing about is but she’s so consumed with wallowing in self-pity (hence the ironic laugh track) that she says it anyways, which is an interesting angle for a song. It sounds… fine, it’s catchy and Hwasa/Kei performing it on *Queendom* is iconic but I can’t say it does much for me.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): very unique concept for a song. Sometimes I wish the verses had a little more something to them though

**untutorable** (7.5): it's been all this time and i still can't decide if this song is problematic or not but i remember when it was first released i wanted it to be a wlw anthem.... rip

**wardrum5** (7.5): Claud did it better

**WeastofEden44** (7.4): I like this, that's about all I have to say about it lol

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): Queen of counting AND using the non-copyrighted 'yay'.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): when people were trying to cancel her over this song, what a mess. People really tried to jump at the chance to cancel an up and coming pop girl

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I understand what she was going for, but man does this song hit a weird note for me.

**Tolk1en** (7): a bit too slow, even for Billie imo. The lyrics are quite bold. I have no idea what popheads think about this specific song. Excited to read the comments

**AnimationJava** (6.5): The messiness on popheads about this song title when it was first announced...

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i wish i wasnt

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.4): maybe I'm just too old for this one idk

**anothertown** (6): lmao... :bonk:

**CarlieScion** (6): this song is just really weird

**meiscool132** (6): I'm not the biggest fan of the countdown aspect in the lyrics, but it's still kind of nice

**nick1372** (6): I was instantly bored by the Discourse as soon as this came out

**Nickl00** (6): I like the counting lyrics but it’s also just kinda ok

**avenueroy** (5): The stock children cheer took me the fuck out

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (5): Not going to lie, I've had a a few gay crushes who weren't interested in me that I wished were straight so it was easier to accept. Still a little weird to say the reverse though.

**JanuaryFourteenth** (5): This album has a problem of not deciding if Billie’s mature or not like maybe that’s the point and I’m dumb but I kinda wish they’d pick one

**mayolizard** (5): meh

**skargardin** (4): so she wishes that the guy was gay so she didn't have to get rejected by him? iono about this one

**strangergravityfalls** (4): there's nothing that's actually homophobic about the song, it's just boring (there is something gross about her kind of taking credit for the guy she wrote it about's coming out but...)

**george\_kaito** (3): girl anyways

**vayyiqra** (3): I bet this is a day 1 song because of its messy lyrics; but even aside from that, it's not that great of a song. The main reason I'm rating it so low is that it's boring and feels like a chore to get through.

**vhqv1997** (3): Is this song offensive? Offensively boring, maybe. But offensive? No. I think she's just being really cringe.

**wavingwolves** (3): this "i wish you were gay so i could deal with rejection differently" thing makes me very very uncomfortable and even if she owns it's selfish i don't think it makes a difference

**ggodisawomann** (2): I never liked this song

**pearllouise** (2): too straight

**puberty1** (2): controversies aside this is not even good

**bespectacIed** (1): This is laughably cringey i imagine finneas and billie doing this song in the studio and thinking they did sumn amusing

**Kromorei** (1): i almost 0'd this

**MelodramaticLemonade** (1): It may not be homophobic, but it sure is obnoxious as hell. The sound effects just flat out make me cringe

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): this song is so unnecessary and "ambiguously" problematic, i'm too lazy to talk about it. and even just musically, it's still fucking trash and by far the worst song on the album. zero-worthy.

**mudkip1** (1): she should've thrown this in the garbage

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): im not even gonna say anything bc i could write a whole essay about why this song and it’s meaning are bad

Re-listening to Cuz I Love You, I realized that this would have been the perfect album closer. The outro is phenomenal, and one of the best representations of Lizzo’s talent and musical abilities. The choir, flute, and composition of that last minute or so of just reprisal, it works **so** well and is something that would’ve been the perfect capstone for this album. 

This is going to sound like a strange comparison, but this could’ve been Lizzo’s ‘Perfect Places’. The starting point for Cuz I Love You being the title track, and ending potentially with Heaven Help Me, it creates a small point A/B run, and the idea of it ending here would’ve been perfect for me. 

---

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Honestly this song is perfection imo. And I loooove the outro

**gannade** (10): the song is like an 8 but that flute solo

**ImADudeDuh** (10): made me more religious than 16 years of catholicism ever did

**jayjaysortagay** (10): omg I forgot about this one, what a jam, love it love it love it

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I’m a sucker for a good gospel choir

**pearllouise** (10): Sasha Flute > Lizzo

**Stryxen** (10): she needs all the help she can get, if me and this song were at a party I would be drunk hyping it up in the bathroom

**WeastofEden44** (10): And on the 8th day, God created bussy popping.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.2): I love this song but I hate how short it is! It’s pretty but it’s like two and a half minutes long and then a flute outdo, I need more!

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The transition into Lingerie is perfect.

**george\_kaito** (9): disney soundtrack teas

**hadea0090** (9): lizzo knows how to write a good hook

**rhyneston3** (9): So fun! This album is just pure fun I love it

**runaway3212** (9): Lizzo at her best

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I want the ending to go back to that bombastic intro sound but it's still a slam dunk song

**1998tweety** (8.5): This bops a fair bit, the verses are nice too.

**hikkaru** (8.5): the flute solo at the end is SO good

**ladililn** (8.5): I wish this had one more verse or a bridge or SOMETHING rather than spending the last third(!) on the outro. The first two minutes are such a smash, and then it just noodles its way out.

**materialqirl** (8.5): bop

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8.5): ugh she didn't fuck around w that flute solo

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): omg a flute solo at the end yess

**radiofan15** (8.2): This really went from a gospel tune with a Moby instrumental to trap with a flute and I'm here for it

**akanewasright** (8): The rap is really fun. The chorus is kinda weak though. I was about to give this a 7.5, but then the flue came in and I got way happier.

**bespectacIed** (8): The 80s ballad piano mixed with the trap beats are so jarring lol but they suprisingly work well together

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): I like the song this shifts to a lot more than I like what came before it. Be messy girl, you earned it.

**nooodisaster** (8): ALMOST THE BOP OF THE ALBUM!!!1 The first two minutes are easily an 11, and then she had to slow it down after the 2 minute mark :///

**waluigiest** (8): seeing this live really made me believe in this track. The last minute is stunning

**Mysario** (7.9): it's not this song's fault but I'm sick of the trap beat this deep in the rate. or maybe it is. trap beats are fine but this really made me realize how much of the better part of last year's tracks were just filled with them. it's the equivalent of country's top hits singing about trucks on the old dirt road. get something original, producers

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): The song felt longer than it actually is, but the outro kind of drags on a bit too long even though it sounds nice

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): does this sample something super popular? sounds really familiar

**twat\_brained** (7.3): at this point in the album Lizzo's schtick is starting to wear thin on me

**bandnitos** (7): i love the piano

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): She's been verrrry emotional on this album.. I forgot this song was on the standard edition lol

**cleen\_claire** (7): Bop material

**ladywolvs** (7): but the flute part at the end is a 10

**skargardin** (7): boppy

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7): the outro, love!!

**wasian-invasion** (7): lizzo flautist

**Clearer-Skies** (6.5): is that her playing the flute at the end? lovely

**FluffyNobody** (6): It got a whole point more because of the outro with the flute

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): love the flute

**leviswift13** (6): the kesha lyric was the nail in the coffin that made me switch from an 8 to a 6. i really liked it at first and then it just got ... worse

**NotWith10000Men** (6): middle third of this album just isn't doing it for me at all

**vayyiqra** (6): woke and +1 for the word "dickmatized"

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Her rap-leaning parts are the highlight here, but outside those, it's a little forgettable.

**Johnnytoby** (5): so when is dua lipas album getting rated, so cute she prob played the flute

**kappyko** (5): I dont normally believe in conspiracies but yeah she KNEW she was gonna be tiktoks thing lol.

**Kromorei** (5): sure i guess...

**meiscool132** (5): I don't really like the beat and the piano, overall I just think it's a weird mix of things, and it doesn't flow as well to me as the rest of the album

**Nickl00** (5): EVEN louder Jesus

**anothertown** (4.5): this is when she starts to remind me of Macklemore

**ManofOranges** (4): I just don't really have anything to say about this song? Like it's yet another deep cut that's just like... here. Next.

**mayolizard** (4): i don't know… hmm

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (4): Honestly, this song along with the last stretch of the album feels like one loud continuous noise.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (3.1): Uhh too much :(

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i got so bored listening to this that halfway through i paused it to do something else and when i went back i forgot what it sounded like

**mms82** (2): just discombobulated, not well put together, and her vocals don't really work here

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): me trying to get through this song

**vhqv1997** (1): Could have just left this off the album cause I can find at least 8 other songs on this same album with the same sentiment but sounds more clever

**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): Melodically flat, loud

nickl00: I’ll be honest I mentioned how loud probably like 3 or 4 tracks were on Lizzo’s album. But they are. I’ll agree that paper rings is loud, and cruel summer is at the end, but those are 2 out of 18 tracks while Lizzo’s album is too loud half the time. Literally all they had to do was turn the volume of the song down and they’d be fine. It just gets a little irritating even if I like the song overall

wanderingimpromptu3: None of those Taylor songs are loud in the same way though. It's not really about the production, it's about the vocals. Lizzo has a kind of loud, yell-y vocal style which some (including me) find grating, especially when she's rap-singing.

**runaway3212** (10): Everything in this song works together perfectly

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): This is almost a perfect song, songs that are haunting yet (relatively) upbeat are my kryptonite

**cleen\_claire** (9): ROMA DESERVED BEST PICTURE FUCK GREEN BOOK

**lapascalia** (9): I haven’t seen Roma but this doesn’t seem like it would fit with the movie?? Either way, it’s a great song!

**nooodisaster** (9): The most random collab of all time and it was worth it.

**puberty1** (9): should this song be related to ROMA whatsoever? no, even the reference to the movie is bad. is it a bop? yes.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I don’t see how this is related to ROMA because the song feels out of place within the movie’s vibe and time period. Nonetheless, the song is still really good and the progression is really catchy.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This sounds like the background music in *Age Of Mythology*

**Mysario** (8.1): is that a dog in the background?

**Kromorei** (5): okay i guess [2]

**ManofOranges** (5): I don't really remember much about this one, even right after listening to it. Like No Time to Die, I think it sounded very cinematic, but it didn't do anything interesting!

Not only did Taylor Swift say *Gay Rights™* this era, she also said *Feminism™*. You can tell she felt very bad about not speaking up about her support for Hillary Clinton during her campaign, and to make up, she created a song for her to use the next time she runs for office.

In my opinion, this song and *You Need To Calm Down* and their music videos are some necessary steps Taylor needs to take if she indeed wants to be more political in her music. She spent years mastering the way she writes about her own feelings, and you can see how much she grows over the years when comparing *Teardrops On My Guitar* to *All Too Well*, but if we talk activism, the closest she’s gone in the past to say anything about it is “haters gonna hate” and “sexism is bad, women can do anything a man can”, so it makes sense her big political statements went back to that. 

The Man’s message is not necessarily bad nor false, but it’s surface level and the lyrics feel a bit on the nose, it feels like with such a wide topic Taylor was a bit out of her depth, with that being said, she does seem to be learning how to tackle more serious topics on songs, like on *Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince*, where she’s able to describe the current political state in a more reformed and artistic way.

At the end of the day, this song gave us Taylor Swift saying “bitches” and dressing up and an oddly hot dude, so we got a lot from it.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): A little on the nose but man is it a fun song examining (albeit superficially) how hard it is to be a woman in a man's world. See, Lover, THIS is how you do a bridge. *(ricki’s note: noah fance but how DARE YOU compare this bridge to Lover’s)*

**berober04** (10): My finacee will kill me if I don't rate this any lower than a 10

**CritneySpearz** (10): did she fucking lie with the lyrics

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): THE FIRST SONG WHERE TAYLOR SAID BITCH, NOT ONCE BUT TWICE. HER FIRST EVER FULL FEMINIST SONG. AND TAYLOR JUST ENDED STINKY CIS WHITE HETERO MEN IN HER MUSIC VIDEO. TAYLOR ALISON FINDLAY SWIFT DOES IT AGAIN. WE STAN.

**eeveefan01** (10): Men are canceled

**Evanbrooks324** (10): , taylor ended men peridot

**fadedblue09** (10): I have no time to discuss the politics behind this, but ISSA BOP and no one can convince me otherwise.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): yessss taylor read them for filth

**patcheso8** (10): men cry I laugh

**radiofan15** (10): am I the only person turned on by male Taylor Swift?

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Sasha Fierce found dead in a ditch uplifted by her feminist sister who ended up making a better song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): trans rights!

**twat\_brained** (10): All this coming from a woman who **dated John Mayer**; the highest x-value of white and highest y-value of male in the Cartesian plane of "white men with acoustic guitar" musicians. The music video gives it the 10 it so richly deserves; Taylor is hilarious in it. The Loren Gray cameo is just the icing on a cake that loudly proclaims "fuck men." 10/10 would gender study again.

**franch** (9.7): the music video must have increased this score from when this album came out

**materialqirl** (9.7): id be the man face morph

**mayolizard** (9.4): bop but surprising how little impact this made.

**Mysario** (9.1): not a totally favourite but I think is probably one of her best songs that gets unfairly hated on by... men

**alwayswords** (9): as a woman i am obligated to give this a good score

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Grew on me over time.

**Jimmy345960** (9): I am a man, she is right

**lapascalia** (9): I didn’t care for the instrumental at first but loved the lyrics. Now I can say I love the song, but I just wish she’d made this single earlier.

**leviswift13** (9): tyler swift ended the patriarchy. also, the haim vibes on the chorus are everythinggggggg

**Nickl00** (9): I wish the lyrics were a little deeper but it’s still a major bop

**nooodisaster** (9): She snapped and told people that if she was the man then she'd be the man.

**pearllouise** (9): Scooter Braun can choke on a dick.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): she said what she said

**rsmitty99** (9): Not a new theme by any standard. But again, Taylor delivers another catchy bop.

**wasian-invasion** (9): she can play a cat a cyborg a zombie a brunette AND a man? queen of versatility

**1998tweety** (8.5): Ugh we fucking LOVE a trans anthem. Ok at first I did not like this cause of the lyrics, but you know what????? Taylor told ZERO lies. The wordplay is kind of cute but loses its charm after a while. Thankfully it actually bops.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): ended sexism in the industry

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): don't see a lot of love for this one but i think it's really well written?

**cleen\_claire** (8): Such a bop, really grew on me

**george\_kaito** (8): its a bit monotonous but the last chorus slaps

**ggodisawomann** (8): feminist anthem

**hikkaru** (8): i love the punches of synth but it could be better

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): A bit on the nose but I love explicitly feminist bops

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): Another cute song. Lyrics are pretty basic and overdone but also true so whatevah

**cyborglilith** (7.5): kinda annoying

**FluffyNobody** (7.5): It's nice (and I guess overdue), but I've never understood the hype behind it to be honest

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7.5): Taylor singlehandedly proves that if I ever needed to ask her for help to open a pickle jar she’d do it no problem so

**Kromorei** (7.5): this song is one of the better singles on the album. it was hard to suck worse than lover the song

**rickikardashian** (7.5): baby’s first social critic

**avenueroy** (7.1): This song is corny as hell, but damn, the chorus hits

**anagalisgv** (7): taylor said bitch

**AnimationJava** (7): A very catchy bop about feminism! We love to see it.

**Anthony-Vince** (7): Not my favorite, and not a huge fan of the production, but I still sing along to it

**bandnitos** (7): i like everything besides the tempo. if they slowed it down to around 100 bpm i feel like it'd be much better

**runaway3212** (7): "When everyone believes you, what's that like" saves this song for me

**shesdoingyoga** (7): The lyrics are the most successful part. The production feels a bit uninspired coming after two incredibly strong songs and the chorus almost feels flat due to not a whole lot of movement in the melody but it’s overall still not bad

**skargardin** (7): it really starts to drag towards the end but overall it's cute and gets its point across

**untutorable** (7): she's very on the nose! but it's a bit of a bop so i'm not bothered

**vayyiqra** (7): Musically one of the best tracks on the album, a great hook - but I'm not quite sure how to feel about the lyrics. Taylor is of course right that there are tons of double standards that apply to women, even one as rich and influential as her - privilege is relative. However, her immense wealth and success makes it hard for me to sympathize with her in some ways and I can't shake that feeling. I know it's a controversial take, but I can't be alone on this.

**waluigiest** (7): as far as underdeveloped feminist anthems from the past few years go, this is not bad

**wavingwolves** (7): almost everytime a white female popstar tries to make a empowering anthem it sounds tone deaf at worst and superficial at best and this is not really a exception. i still like it but at the same time it bothers me. also, i really want to recommend the feminism for the 99% manifesto by cintia arruzza, nancy fraser and tithi bhattacharya

**WeastofEden44** (7): I loved this song initially but it aged like milk 2 weeks after the album was released

**cashewconstellation** (6.6): Wow, this has aged since I listened to Lover. The message is good, and the quick part is good, but the track is lacking.

**ladililn** (6.5): Love the message, but to me this is the sonic equivalent of club soda.

**meiscool132** (6.5): I like the message but meh. and Taylor as a man kinda traumatised me

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): A strong premise for a song, there's just not enough here. The lyrics punch, but they need to punch harder. The sound is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't feel entirely complete. It's just okay. It's not "filler" in the same way too many tracks on this album are, but it's not fully realized.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): this song just seems a little basic to me but the MV was great. i think it definitely shows the state of equality when taylor, who is arguably the most privileged a woman can get (white, thin, rich etc) still deals with a lot of bias + sexism

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): it insists upon itself

**TiltControls** (6.5): I like the lyrics, but the production is pretty forgettable

deleted: **akanewasright** (6): I like this song a lot more acoustic. I actively dislike a lot of the production choices here. The weird choir and post chorus synth line prevent it from being a bop.

**CarlieScion** (6): like I GET IT but also this is so heavyhanded with the feminist themes lol. Extra points for getting to hear Taylor sing ‘bitches and models’ tho

**dreamingoutloud92** (6): I like the message, but the production is kind of a miss for me.

**lilacsweetener** (6): Very tailored toward younger audiences which is fine but I’m ready for a more layered takedown of patriarchy. She’s heading toward that if Miss Americana docu is any indication. Instrumentation is basic too but that’s to emphasise the lyrics. I’m all about the wistful, forlorn ending.

**ManofOranges** (6): If I could describe the sound of this song in one word, it would without a doubt be generic. If you ignore the lyrics and everything else and just focus on actual sound of the song, it sounds like a bunch of other run-of-the-mill songs that I've heard before. As far as the lyrics go.... they're fine. I do think she has some points, but none that I haven't already heard before. It just feels like she's not saying anything that hasn't already been said.

**PoppyPigglet** (6): Kinda a missssssss

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): Nothing that requires too much thought, but catchy

**Stryxen** (5.5): I liked the song less after the video came out, but I still liked the video?

**Austine567** (5): this song is lame and beats you over the head so much that the message becomes unimportant

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): Songs about Taylor's reputation would dig deeper if she didn't talk about it every fucking album.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I am a women and I approve of the message in this song, but she always just executes everything in the most annoying way. The bridge low key gives me life though

**kappyko** (5): the satire's fine but this is just tennis court

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): I can’t tell if I love or hate this song honestly

**nick1372** (5): Listen. Taylor Swift is allowed to make this song. Sure, it's a bit obtuse. Obviously, Taylor has managed to spin a lot of the sexism she's encountered into attention that she has monetarily capitalized on. But honestly a lot of the lyrics here are smart, or at least cute enough to hold water. Too bad the production sounds like dog shit.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): this would have felt so cool in 2014 but it just feels old hearing it now

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.6): I’m kind of rolling my eyes here, I’m sympathetic to the sexism that women face but I think that this song has the wrong approach. Yes we criticize women for doing things that we praise men for, but tbh we shouldn’t be praising *anyone* for some of the things she talks about here. She’s framing the issue as “if I were a man I’d be able to get away with it” rather than “why do we let men get away with this?” ~~It’s catchy at least.~~ I tried to remember what it sounded like and couldn’t.

**anothertown** (4): Get your pussy hats girls! We’re white feminism tonight!

**Awkward\_King** (4): i love this sonically and the subject matter obviously but it's just so fucking on the nose it annoys me to listen to it

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Taylor i hate you and your team and your TERRIBLE SINGLE CHOICES!!!!!!

**Johnnytoby** (4): forgot this was a single lol

**lordeofmylife** (4): why do all of her singles suck

**puberty1** (4): "if i was a man i'd be the man" is truly the pinnacle of bad swiftism

**bespectacIed** (3): Dated production, unimpressive message when it came from an extremely privileged place, corny lyrics

**hadea0090** (3): wow so empowering <3

**jayjaysortagay** (3): I like the synths but the self-serious lyrics don't match the cheesy sound to me, I think I have this problem with TS generally. She seems committed to feminism but her lyrics are so superficial.

**mudkip1** (3): meh

**selegend** (3): corny

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (3): i could write a thesis on why this song is lazy and why taylor is a particularly poor messenger for this, but I'll leave it

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.4): lmao this is like baby's first feminist anthem

**frogaranaman** (2): https://i.imgur.com/qBmqIkd.png

**gannade** (1): privileged white feminism is getting mad that your net worth, from a career that your daddy bankrolled, is "only" worth 250m and then blaming it on being a woman.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i’m not trying to downplay the message of this song bc fuck sexism in the music industry, but maybe taylor swift, one of the most popular, successful musicians of all time, shouldn’t be the one singing it. also it just sounds bad in general lol

(And no, "I love shiny things but I'd marry you with paper rings" is not badly written... things don't have to be ~deep and mature~ to be well written. Paper Rings is cute and childish but the lyrics are evocative & flow well) 

That said I don't personally love the song just bc I don't love how it sounds.

One of my old music teachers used to call me “aryan” as a joke because of my blond hair and blue eyes. 

I have successfully cried in front of authority figures to get out of trouble. 

I used to be afraid of eating generic grocery store mild salsa because I thought it would be too spicy. 

What I’m saying is that I might be one of the most basic White people, let alone white gay men in this rate. 

Keep that in mind when I say what the FUCK was the white nonsense you all pulled today!? 

You did Lizzo dirty, and I honestly didn’t even like her album as much as most of the others.

wanderingimpromptu3: > You did Lizzo dirty, and I honestly didn’t even like her album as much as most of the others.

If you don't think her album is better than the others, then what exactly is wrong with the outcome of today...? Lizzo lost 5 songs, as did Billie. Taylor lost 6. Ariana lost 3. 

In terms of percentage of songs lost, Lizzo did equally well as Taylor (except she lost 0 songs in the bottom 10 and Taylor lost 4), a little worse than Ari and a little better than Billie. She basically did better than everyone except Ari.
[/r/popheads/comments/gkhho6/the_2019_main_pop_girls_rate_day_1_when_we_all/fqrphu4/]

akanewasright: Lizzo lost a lot of very good songs. She lost 45% of her standard edition album, which is way more than Taylor (33%), Billie (35)%, or Ari (25%). 

Also, more importantly, a lot of the comments were bullshit. I’m sorry, if you called her “too loud” (which... haha... [you specifically did](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/gkhho6/the_2019_main_pop_girls_rate_day_1_when_we_all/fqrn9o0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)), I have no respect for you.

Yes, I did. I don't like Lizzo's vocal style, which I personally find grating. I also don't like xanny's production style for similar reasons. 

It's music & it's subjective. A lot of people dislike Billie (my favorite) bc she's "too quiet" and whispers, so I'm not sure why it's so unacceptable to dislike Lizzo bc she's too loud.

wanderingimpromptu3: > Edit: If it's too loud, turn down your own volume.

As someone who has said Lizzo's songs are too loud, it's not really about the overall loudness, it's about the vocals. Lizzo tends to sing (and especially tends to rap/rap-sing) like she's yelling in my ear. I understand it's her style and there's nothing objectively wrong with it, I just find it grating. Turning down the sound wouldn't do anything to fix it, just like turning up the sound wouldn't fix Billie's whisper-singing for those who dislike that.

katycat162534: Ahh okay, then I LOVE YOU r/popheads, but even Me and You Need to Calm Down are striked out? And I am pretty sure those are cancelled? Is it like bonus tracks in reverse and the main pop girls rate in normal?

brenda_official: ME! is now the 50th lowest rated song in popheads history, slightly better than People Are Crazy by Billy Currington and slightly worse than Turn Up the Music by Chris Brown
