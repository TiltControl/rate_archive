Well hello, popheads!

You know what’s a thing this sub loves?

Yes!, bitching about our faves, but you know what it loves doing even more? Seeing our Pop girls succeed, and boy was 2019 nice to us. After a few years of us constantly complaining about women flopping in the industry (but not really), 2019 brought us a lot of amazing new music, and for our delight, some of the biggest names this year were 4 women this sub is very fond of. Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Lizzo and Taylor Swift all enjoyed great success last year, and in honor of the bops they gave us, the constant confusion over single choices, and the hundreds of think-pieces written about them, we’ll be rating their last albums, so we can find out who truly was the *Main Pop Girl™* of 2019.

#Taylor Swift - Lover

Taylor Swift opened up her new era by killing New Taylor™, ditching the dark, reptilian imagery, and allowing a sweet, pastel-colored aesthetic take over her 7th album, *Lover*. Following a label change, Swift decided to follow her new motto of "[doing whatever the hell she wants](https://youtu.be/ZVpkFb9-fts?t=885)", and it shows, as in the album she experiment with elements never done in her career, both lyrically and musically. Although it having some very notable low moments, *Lover*’s highs are some of the most fascinating musical moments in Swift’s catalogue, showcasing her classic song-writing style in a more mature light than ever before. While *Lover’s* success story is less surprising or unconventional than the other 3 albums, it still reached some amazing feats, like debuting on the BB200 with 867k sales, getting certified Platinum x3 worldwide on its first week, and becoming the best selling album by a female artist of 2019, and second overall.

#Billie Eilish - When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?

Since the release of her first minor hit, *Ocean Eyes*, Billie Eilish has been slowly stabilising herself not only as the go-to act for moody Tumblr teenagers that already heard the entirety of Lorde and Lana del Rey's discographies, but as a star waiting for her big breakthrough, having songs like *Lovely* and *When The Party's Over* slowly peeking the charts, even then, no one was prepared for the avalanche that her debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, would be. A big part of the album’s success was thanks to the inclusion of what would become one of the biggest hits of the year, *Bad Guy*, but the level of success achieved by this track and album wouldn’t have been possible without Finneas’ odd yet polished production, and Billie’s slowly crafted aesthetic that not only made her easily recognizable to the general public, but showed a clear direction and drive to differentiate herself from anything else in the mainstream. Mix all these ingredients together, and you get the highest selling album in the U.S., a clean sweep at the Grammy’s, and one of the brightest futures from any new artist recently.

#Ariana Grande - thank u, next

In 2018, Ariana Grande completed her transition into the A-list having released her biggest project yet, *Sweetener*, reaching immediate success with all her singles, however, with this level of fame her private life became public discussion constantly, mostly fueled by the rise and fall of her engagement with Pete Davidson, and the sudden death of Ariana’s ex-boyfriend Mac Miller. In November, *thank u, next* was unexpectedly dropped, marking the beginning of the era with the same name. Contrasting the joy showed on her 2018 release, *thank u, next* shows a more personal side of Ariana, exposing to the public the confusing state of her current mental health and how it affects her relationships in different ways. Her sincerity paid off, as it gave Ariana two #1 hits, some of the strongest streaming numbers from any current artist, and filled the top 3 of the BB100 on its release week.

#Lizzo - Cuz I Love You (Super Deluxe)

In a year of full of surprising success stories, Lizzo was one of the standouts. After a few years releasing mixtapes and loose singles, Lizzo started early in the year the rollout for her long-awaited debut, dropping *Juice*, the funk-inspired bop that would put Lizzo on top of the charts, but despite r/pophesdscirclejerk best efforts, the track didn't become the smash hit it deserved to become, making Cuz I Love You debut on the BB200 with 41k sales in April 19th. Lizzo started gaining traction a little later, thanks to her 2017 single, *Truth Hurts*, being used in the movie *Someone Great* and getting adopted by the internet to create a plethora of different memes. This push was enough to get Lizzo a 1# hit, a Grammy win, another Top 5 hit with Good As Hell, and skyrocket her into *Main Pop Girl*™ status, all in less than 6 months.

#Bonus Rate

In today’s streaming world, it’s more common for an artist to release more remixes, loose singles and collaborations to try and grab the attention from the public a little longer. Up next there’s a group of different tracks that all 4 artist released around the time these eras were taking place, but didn’t make the albums. Also, in honor of the era-that-never-was, we’ll also rate *Never Really Over* by former successful musician, Katy Perry.

**Reminder:** The Bonus Rate is completely optional, but it’s funner if you do it. You don’t need to rate every single song, and you can’t give any of these songs your 0 or 11.

#Rules
Most of you are probably familiar with how rates work and their rules, but we’re legally required to write them down and invite you to read them.

* You have to listen to **EVERY SINGLE SONG**. Ballots with scores missing won’t be accepted.

* Rate every song with a score ranging from 1 to 10. You may use up to one decimal spot, meaning that you can give a song a **7.8** or a **6.9**, but not at **8.472** or a **6.66**. If you do use decimals, remember to do them with a dot ( . ) and not a comma ( , )

* You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11) across the entire rate. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track.

* Your scores shouldn’t be considered confidential, they will literally be shared for everyone to see, that’s the whole point of this.

* Use the prepared format found [**HERE**](https://tinyurl.com/w2num2f) to fill in and send your scores. If for some reason, that link isn’t working, [**HERE’S THE PRE-FORMATTED FORM**](https://pastebin.com/z5AFmdtJ) and you can send it to /u/MainPopGirls2019Rate (or any of the hosts accounts, u/rickikardashian and u/_wailordfan, but the other account would be preferred)

* You may change your scores at any time, just message u/MainPopGirls2019Rate (or any of the hosts) to do so!

* Leaving comments on tracks are encouraged but not required. To do so, leave a space after your score and write your comment

>Closer: 10 I can’t believe we’re rating this song in a totally unrelated rate, who would’ve thought? Halsey stans rise up!

That is the only correct format when leaving comments. Anything else, is incorrect and will not be accepted.

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the album name and put your comment there.

>Album: thank u, next: My name is Pete Davidson and I don’t approve of the messages in this album

* Finally, sabotage will be 100% not tolerated, and the hosts reserve the right to not accept you ballot if we’re suspicious you’re trying to purposefully sabotage the results to someone’s favor. Don’t be a douchebag, this is supposed to be fun for everyone.
