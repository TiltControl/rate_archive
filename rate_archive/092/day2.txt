Welcome to Day 2, AKA hell day. 

We will begin revealing  here at **4pm EST**. We will be revealing tracks #40 - #21, and the middle 6 bonus rate songs

Join us here in this thread as we post total scores and comments for each song, and also in the plug, which we have revived for this reveal, located **[here](https://plug.dj/popheads/)**

--- 

We had 236 amazing participants, all of which can be found **[here](https://pastebin.com/7MiNHmdZ)**. This makes this rate the most participated in rate ever on /r/popheads. 

In addition to that fun fact, here are some additional notes to take into account before we begin revealing: 

The average score was 7.389, that means that anything below this sucks, and anything above it is actually good. 

The average controversy score was 2.021, that means that anything below it is ~~a song by Ariana, and anything above it is a song by Taylor~~ a non-controversial placement, and anything above it was a controversial song.

deleted: I'm quite surprised how homogeneous my opinion seems to be with the consensus. The bottom four of Lover is my personal worst as well (ME!, YNTCD, Lodon Boy, INTHAF) and Cuz I Love You takes indeed a nose dive in the second half of the album, only to rise again with the super deluxe tracks. The only great song that went out yesterday was 7 rings, an absolute bop.

---

# #TRUMP2020

**bespectacIed** (1): She was hella wrong for this one ... gays don't deserve any rights

#shade never made anybody less gay!

**1998tweety** (10): queen did nothing wrong

**jimmy345960** (10): You Need to Calm Down is a good song and Taylor was a good ally, im ready to be roasted

**hadea0090** (10): lmao does Taylor understand subtlety

**anothertown** (9): By the time she did this last year, we had kind of stopped seeing celebs pandering so hard like they did earlier in the decade, and now I'm older and jaded so it's just funny and dumb instead of infuriating

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Yeah, she was a bit misguided, but it's not like it was done with ill intent?

**wavingwolves** (6): i'll be honest and say that the petition was a good and solid strategy but the song and video itself are not my favourites

**lilacsweetener** (5): she had made her stance clear prior to this but you have to be blatant before anyone actually hears you...then they tell you YOU’RE BEING TOO LOUD.

**leviswift13** (4): this like is so fucking dumb, let the girl have her gay rights moment

**ReallyCreative** (4): "Cause shade never made anybody less gay" set back gay rights back to the 1950s but the video was cute I guess. Idk, it was performative activism and a mediocre song but she did donate money and raise awareness about stuff so I'll overlook it I guess

**runaway3212** (4): I feel like I will die not knowing why this was drama at all.

**vhqv1997** (4): Sure, this feels a bit pandering but only white privileged gays would complain about getting transparent support from one of the most powerful people in the entire world

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (3): Like Ariana's 'black fishing', this is completely overblown. And really, you people push Taylor to be political (even calling her a fucking Nazi) and as soon as she tries to help US, you complain. Kelly Clarkson was right, "You can't win."


**E3-NotTheConvention** (2): I didn't see anyone talking about it, the Katy and the pop divas moment stole the spotlight

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (0): Ugh, I always hated this discourse that Taylor is suddenly "profiting" off the LGBTQ+ community. She has always supported us, gay fans, for SO MANY YEARS EVEN DURING HER COUNTRY DAYS. [Lemme link my Twitter thread from my Stan Twitter account where I provided receipts that she has always been an ally to the community ever since.](https://twitter.com/drwhowhenhowwhy/status/1003801134115389440)

#you’re being too loud

**meiscool132** (7): I mean, it was suspicious at the least

**Tolk1en** (6): too expected, not really original, deja vu, but I somehow enjoyed reading about that.

**RosaPalms** (7): She is trying so hard to become a gay icon. It's actually pretty disgusting to use the gay community for promo. Since when has she been an advocate for us? Don't @ me either. I've had to deal with white gays on twitter already. In a way, I feel like she's trying to jump onto Kacey Musgraves gig with Golden Hour. I can't stand Taylor Swift.

**mudkip1** (3): im glad shes a democrat but this is not a good song

**TragicKingdom1** (3): giving this the same score as the song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): is she though

**ImAMessyBitchDuh** (0): worst song ever!

**puberty1** (0): the gays trying to defend her in this sub was one of the lowest points in queer history and that's tea

#capitalism

**radiofan15** (5): I see Taylor accidentaly googled "Pink money" and got an ephipany…

**twat\_brained** (9.7): jennifer_lawrence_gay_rights.mp4. The ham-fisted imagery and lyricism just reminds me of how "gay pride" has devolved into "Gay Pride! *available at participating locations". This controversy is founded and necessary.

Before the release of the album, Taylor decided to give her fans a small gift and debuted early what would be the Track 5™ of Lover. The Archer has a simple, dreamy production that allows the brutally honest lyrics shine. It’s one of the most personal songs Swift has released yet and it gave some peace to the people bothered that Taylor might have lost the golden touch she had when it came to songwriting, so it seemed like *The Archer* was on its way to become a beloved track, but by the time the album came out, it seemed to have gotten forgotten. It has an ongoing crescendo build-up that ends suddenly, which bothered a lot of people, but personally I think it complements the inner monologue vibe this song has, and I think that’s the best way to look at this, as a small snippet to Taylor’s diary that we don’t get to see ^(Unless you buy the 4 deluxe versions of Lover, available at Target)

And yes, this song is a Lorde pastiche, but we’re not getting any new music from her any time soon, so I’m satisfied with what I get.

Wailord: A LOT of people hate this and I get it, they don’t see a direction in the music, but HOLY SHIT this is so pretty and the lyrics are great but I’ve been arguing with people about that all week and I’m tired but yeah this deserved a bit better. 

---

**cyborglilith** (11): I want to take this moment to

**akanewasright** (10): I know some people think this song is boring, but I love the build to nothing, the honest lyrics, and even the damn Humpty Dumpty reference that calls back to her old fairy tale referencing ways.

**bandnitos** (10): pain

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): After the atrocious second single my hope for the album was truly lost, but The Archer made me do another 180. This is Taylor at her most vulnerable, and the only protetction she has here is the impeccably ethereal production. Flawless.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a fucking classic

**leviswift13** (10): this song is intensely personal for me. it's kind of hard to talk about it. this is the first song i've ever cried to on the first listen. everytime i hit play, i feel like she is stealing the thoughts and scars and secrets from my the deepest parts of my heart. it's goth synth-pop perfection. "i never grew up, it's getting so old" is an all-timer.

**mayolizard** (10): I really love her vocals and the production on dis song… her serve methinks

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is the most Antonoff of all songs with Antonoff production

**TiltControls** (10): I actually like that the song doesn't need to ramp up too much at the end.

**twat\_brained** (10): taylor swift has never made a bad song in the key of C major.

**avenueroy** (9.8): Possibly her best song, definitely top 5.

**radiofan15** (9.7): Just like I Forgot That You Were The Album Opener, this one has a nice vibe and everything but still needs some extra push to truly stand out... but at least this one doesn't have corny Drake references so this is a definitive improvement in my book.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): I love the cut off my nose line

**Awkward\_King** (9): i thought this was one everyone liked tbh i remember the release thread for this as a promo single was really positive, then again that was after me! and yntcd lmao. still though it holds up its still one of my favorites from the album

**bespectacIed** (9): Sag anthem by a Sag queen. I love the simplicity of this. Love that it doesn't follow a typical pop structure, it sounds like a Beach House song. Indie taylor I am ready for u

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Delicate, but not delicate. I dig it.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I feel like if Taylor didn't release The Archer as a promo single, Swifties would have loved this song even more. I guess The Archer being released before the album came out was needed because there needs to be a song from the album that contrasted to the upbeat vibe of ME! and YNTCD. Being the "track five" of the album, it had huge shoes to fill especially since the previous "track five" was the well-loved Delicate on "reputation". Considering the album's context and Taylor's career overall, The Archer is the perfect "track five" for Lover. I would even argue that Cornelia Street works better as a "track nine" than "track five" even though Cornelia deals with anxiety in a relationship, which is inadvertently the recurring theme on Taylor's "track fives". You can tell that Taylor is really vulnerable in this song and she is basically singing from her consciousness here. When this was played as the last song on Miss Americana, I grew to love the song even more and it solidified why I believe this is one of her underrated gems on her discography.

**FluffyNobody** (9): When it came out, I said it was Taylor at her most vulnerable, and I stand by the statement. For a person so used to sing about all the wrongs she's received, it takes a lot to admit she's the reason things implode sometime.

**frogaranaman** (9): this is one of my favorite songs Taylor Swift songs in recent memory. while it does sound like a Melodrama b-side (both in production and song-writing), I do feel like of all people Taylor Swift would be one of the few that could (and does on this song) pull off that sound

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): Dreamy

**Jimmy345960** (9): TAYLOR ADMITTING SHE IS WRONG, this song is so complex with so many different feelings. The feeling of being immature and the motif of the arrow with her petty feuds makes the song alleviated for me.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Taylor being self-award actually works here, I’m shocked.

**nooodisaster** (9): Jack Antonoff is a producer legend he never fails. Couple that with some of Taylor's most introspective lyrics in her entire career, and this was the first glimpse that this album was worth investing in. To this day it's a film-thin sheet of ice to sonically get lost in.

**runaway3212** (9): Loved this from the moment I heard it

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): still remember my first time getting on the light rail in seattle, it was amazing then and it's still that good

**1998tweety** (8.5): This took a second to grow on me but you know what it's kinda cute. Is it my favourite Taylor song? No, but it's still a great tune. The emotion is really what carries it.

**cashewconstellation** (8.5): It's a very good song! Probably in my personal top 3 of Lover.

**Kromorei** (8.5): this is like the only standout track on the whole album.

**patcheso8** (8.5): this was a grower then a shrinker then a grower and then more of a grower.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): who hurt you taylor :*(

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.2): I love how it builds up but sadly it leads to nowhere

**franch** (8.1): this song grew on me but...

**Anthony-Vince** (8): This had to grow on me but it's really a beautiful song

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): Beautifully introspective but again, some of the lyrics fall flat.

**CarlieScion** (8): I just wish this song sounded clearer

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): One of the best songs on the album, the synth work on this song is pleasantly mind numbing. You could just say “hunter” though.

**hikkaru** (8): when this dropped and i was like "omg lover era saved this is one of her best songs ever" just bc it's better than me! and yntcd but now i barely listen to it ... still decent tho

**Johnnytoby** (8): the way it grows 🙏🏼

**skargardin** (8): It's a shame that this doesn't really pop off as it's got all the potential to do and just end so abruptly but alas, i still love the atmospherics of it a lot

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): i wish this progresses into something bigger but i still like it for what it is

**vayyiqra** (8): I admit I don't really understand what this song is about, but it sure is pretty, and I love how understated the keyboard is which allows her voice to be up front.

**vhqv1997** (8): Remember how after ME! and You Need To Calm Down were released and everybody was nervous Mrs. Swift had lost all of her songwriting brain cells after Reputation, so she had to scramble to release this otherwise absolute deep cut to tide everyone over?

deleted: **fadedblue09** (7.9): I really really want to like this more since it’s probably the most personal song, but something about the melody and the production doesn’t really sit well with me.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): give this a rerelease as the “Safe and Sound” for the upcoming Hunger Games prequel

**untutorable** (7.5): it's good..... no way around it, it's good

**WeastofEden44** (7.4): Same thing as I said with The Man. It's still a nice song, but... I Forgot That It Existed

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7.3): i do love the blend of Speak Now lyrics with 1989 production but there's just something missing

**alwayswords** (7): lyrically this is great but i wish the song was more exciting

**anothertown** (7): this is not interesting enough but she should explore more

**cleen\_claire** (7): Goes nowhere in a good way tho??

**eeveefan01** (7): Its an alright track, still not sure it deserved the 'Track 5' spot though

**lapascalia** (7): Every time I hear this song now, all I can think of is how it sounds like Taylor was in another room when she recorded it… still a good song though.

**lilacsweetener** (7): Her delivery is forced but the lyrics are sound. The “can you see right through me/I see right through me” cuts to the core of insecurities & not being able to break bad habits. “I cut off my nose to spite my face/And hate my reflection for years” is a top 5 Taylor lyric.

**mms82** (7): it's beautiful and boring

**nick1372** (7): This had sooooo much potential, but at the end of the day fell short. It's a showcase of the duality of taylor swift: an incredibly smart like like "I cut off my nose just to spite my face / then i hate my reflection for years and years" and following it up with that awful humpty dumpty reference???? And the Antonoff production builds up to so much and doesn't amount to anything. This song sounds like the beginning of Green Light without any of the emotional catharsis.

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.8): Your Antonoff is showing

**bulforster** (6.5): I like the self-reflection but each line feels like a disconnected thought and they don't quite fit together.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): we stan the weakest track 5 of her career so far

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.5): Would have been one of the best songs on the album if some of the lyrics hadn't been choices. "Cut off my nose" part kinda ruins it for me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): misses the mark

**anagalisgv** (6): fantastic production but otherwise not really hooked on this

**george\_kaito** (6): loved this track at first but i replayed it so much that i got sick of it. anyways i feel like the lyrics are very superficial, as if she's being really deep for the sake of it. the humpty dumpty line is genius though

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I remember when I first heard this song, I was like “yes this is the best song she has released so far” but when the album released, the song was a massive shrinker. It’s just drawn out and boring and goes no where. I do appreciate the self reflection here though.

**moooo566** (6): boring boring boring oh my god so boring how did this end up being the promo single

**puberty1** (6): it's not bad but it doesn't go anywhere

**rsmitty99** (6): That humpty dumpty line still makes me cringe. Not a great metaphor. I like the message. Taylor is showing "Hey, I get it. I've had some high profile relationships that didn't last. And while I get most of the blame from the media and I bash that a lo, I know I'm not blameless. But I'm still gonna try." You gotta feel for taylor.

**cremeebrulee** (5): this song is soooooooo boring. i would personally have cut it from the album

**hadea0090** (5): I like the production, the lyrics go nowhere.

**pearllouise** (5): Waiting for the beat to kick in for this track is like waiting for COVID-19 to end.

**ReallyCreative** (5): It's very okay but it is brought down by the fact that it's a ballad on an album with too many, and it's not a standout. It's interludey which is fine, except the placement on the track list makes no sense and is generally the entire point of an interlude.

**shesdoingyoga** (5): It’s pretty but I think it would have been more successful as an interlude. The lyrics aren’t enough to carry production that ends up more boring than effective

**Stryxen** (5): so forgettable and I have a bit of an irrational vendetta against this song because of that.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): This song is limp, feels like bathing in a pool of reverb without any aim or direction. But it's pleasant enough

**wardrum5** (4.5): It's boring honestly. Having this, IFTYE, and Lover in the first five tracks is too many slow songs

**agentofscranton** (4): this is one of the most boring songs i've ever heard

**CreepyMannequin** (4): why does she use the lyrics from Humpty Dumpty I-

**jayjaysortagay** (4): boring mashup of Cruel Summer and Lover, sounds like an end credit song for a movie

**mudkip1** (4): this is the biggest letdown of a song what the fuck

**Nickl00** (4): the first of a couple songs that go absolutely nowhere

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): when does this get interesting

**waluigiest** (4): remember when this came out and we were like “omg taylor is back FINALLY.” we were so fucking deprived. like she quoted humpty dumpty sis

**AnimationJava** (3): Honestly this song aged like milk for me, I find it too mellow and chill.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): It's like she heard dream pop for the first time and said "I want to do that" and then failed

**ManofOranges** (3): What's the deal with this one? I remember some people also praising this one, but it's not for me. I'm not afraid to admit that when it comes to aspects of a song, what I listen for most is a melody, and there really isn't one in here. Or if there is I do not remember it whatsoever.

**rhyneston3** (3): Ballads are normally fine with me as long as they're not boring as shit

**wavingwolves** (3): i really really like the lyrics here but i highly dislike taylor's delivery and how the song doesn't grow. it feels kind of like a unrisen cake if that makes any sense.

**ggodisawomann** (2): icky

**kappyko** (2): the most tasteful song so far which is kind of what i dislike because this is all atmosphere and little else. jack antonoff synthpop autophagia

**AbnormalPopPunk** (1): easily the most boring sad/slow song she's ever put out. the whole song is a buildup to nothing.

**letsallpoo** (0): i'm fully convinced that me! and yntcd traumatized swifties so much that they had to pretend that taylor swift reciting humpty dumpty over three synths was some kind of masterpiece

**Mysario** (0): nothing about this is enjoyable, even listening to this while being depressed does nothing but fuel a disgusting cycle of getting more sad because you forgot how to change the song and now you're stuck listening to garbage that was made in an hour

Sorry /u/doctorwhowhenhowwhy I lied to you when I hinted that this may do better than you expected. 

This song is really hurt the most by the tracklisting of this album. It got sandwiched between the two worst songs in this rate, and as a result it is partially hurt by proxy, by myself included. Taken out of context of the album it is a solid album track, but being the meat in YNTCD and ME’s sandwich is really unfortunate. 

---

**CritneySpearz** (11): perfection wow

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): HOLY FUCK. THE MOMENT I HEARD THIS SONG, MY WIG, HEART, AND ENTIRE SPIRIT LEFT PLANET EARTH. I JUST KNEW I HAD TO GIVE AFTERGLOW MY 11. Once again, Taylor showed her maturity here. We see her apologizing for her mistakes and begging her lover to please not end their relationship over an impulsive mistake she made. The chorus of Afterglow is so infectious and it's a solid genuine apology to a lover in a song, backed with Taylor's powerful vocals. The production from Frank Dukes and Louis Bell here is gorgeous as well. I hope TS8 would have more input from them because damn, they know how to make a hit song.

**runaway3212** (11): The lyrics are amazing and so is the sound, the perfect Taylor Swift song

**AnimationJava** (10): Taylor once again shows her vulnerability and admits that maybe she made a mistake. I love these kinds of songs from her the most.

**bandnitos** (10): this was so close to getting my 11

**cyborglilith** (10): underrated

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Remorseful Taylor is the best Taylor. It's going to be dismissed as a Back To December rehash, and such a take isn't entirely wrong, but, yet again, this is one of those moments on the album, where the productions truly shines its brightest and fully sells a song that would otherwise be thought of as filler.

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song grew on me SO hard. I did NOT stan at first but wow, one day it just hit me. I feel these lyrics on a spiritual level

**leviswift13** (10): another song that hits really close to home. i think the chorus is a career highlight; that melody is just everything.

**ManofOranges** (10): Another song involving Taylor's falsetto. Normally this is the part where I'd say I hate it but this is like the one and only song on this album where I think it works. Without a doubt a stand out. It's a shame that this song is so far at the end of the album because you shouldn't have to sift through all the other garbage to get here.

**mayolizard** (10): i love the vocals and shit… like wow

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this is a top-tier Emotion song. it's catchy af too

**patcheso8** (10): I've loved this one from the first listen. It's amazing.

**rhyneston3** (10): This is lovely! Wow she sounds so good

**skargardin** (10): One of my personal top three songs on the album. It really encapsulates the pastel, summery feel of the album cover imo, love it

**1998tweety** (9.5): Underrated bop. It's not a standout on the album but for some reason I like it a lot. The chorus bops quite hard and the bridge is nice too.

**akanewasright** (9.5): People think this song is boring and one of the worst songs in the album, but it’s one of my favorites, honestly.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Another one of the most underrated songs on here. It’s another favourite of mine and I think the chorus is one of the best on the album.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (9.2): i love the light, airy feel to this song

**axestogrind** (9): it seems rare for post-1989 Taylor to express any sort of remorse and self-reflection in her songs so this felt all the more emotionally raw

**ImADudeDuh** (9): CHVRCHES outpeaked but still a bop

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): this concept is great

**meiscool132** (9): wish I could take the blame for things as well as Taylor :/

**FluffyNobody** (8): I think the songwriting in this one is a bit clunky. Also, I always think of the Rob Sheffield comment on this one ('In a good old-fashioned Taylor metaphor party, she compares herself to an arsonist, a wrestler, an island, a prison warden and an ambulance siren") and it makes my day

**ladywolvs** (8): wow i can't believe this might actually be my fav song on lover sandwiched between 2 disasters

**pearllouise** (8): So this is what glitter sounds like?

**wavingwolves** (8): i apprecite this song because i'm bad at apologizing

**franch** (7.8): honestly this sort of feels like filler. good filler, but filler.

**WeastofEden44** (7.8): It's very nice but once again, I forget this song exists sometimes.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I like accountable taylor

**Stryxen** (7.5): heavenly but if heaven dragged on a tiny bit. this is also the song I most associate with the sound of this era

**Anthony-Vince** (7): It has really good lyrics which is why I think it's an objectively good song, but there's just something...hollow about how it sounds.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Pretty 80s inspired song about taking the blame in the fight.

**CarlieScion** (7): I feel like this is an answer to all the people asking if she has any songs where she takes responsibility in her relationships

**cleen\_claire** (7): It's so forgettable but I love it??? somehow?

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): Stream Level of Concern.

**eeveefan01** (7): I often forget about this track

**george\_kaito** (7): the songs kinda start blending together near the end but afterglow is still a pretty solid track

**Nickl00** (7): I like it but still kinda forget it

**nooodisaster** (7): Taylor only admits she messed up if the man gives GOOD dick so... yeah. That's all I gotta say about this one.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is like now or never by halsey if now or never wasn’t a bad song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): definitely one of the better tracks

**twat\_brained** (7): fuck you it's 3:30 am i'm sending this in days after the deadline you can't expect me to remember how every single song in this rate sounds

**vayyiqra** (7): Ackshually, humans cannot see ultraviolet light because they lack the photoreceptors to do so. 0/10, literally unlistenable, demanding my $0.006 back. Unconscionable.

**vhqv1997** (7): There's that stupid vocal production effect from Paper Rings again.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): boring. also track i would cut.

**Johnnytoby** (6.5): why does she always sound like shes singing inside a cardboard box

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): this is nice, and i’ve always enjoyed it when i hear it, but i also forget it sooner than anything else on the album

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): kinda just meh

**Mysario** (6.1): :residentsleeper:

**anothertown** (6): this album is so long. This song should work, but she's not selling it

**bespectacIed** (6): When I saw the leaked tracklist I claimed this song because I thought Taylor finally risks it all and makes a risqué song about the flush and glow of someone's face after sex. Was disappointed it was just a makeup song

**J\_Toe** (6): first time I've listened to this track since the album dropped.

**Kromorei** (6): it's okay.

**untutorable** (6): it's daylight lite but it's not bad

**waluigiest** (6): it’s just so uninteresting, and the production is maybe not it

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5.5): I hate every blue reference on the album and in this song it's especially forced and out of place. The chorus is good, but the verses not so much. Again, the production is way off and completely lacking a melody. Overall an album filler.

**hadea0090** (5): bland

**lilacsweetener** (5): Momentarily obsessed with this but it faded quickly. I’m all about the brilliant second verse’s rhyming scheme but the rest doesn’t hold my attention.

**ReallyCreative** (5): The bridge is really the only thing that captures my attention. It's just another ballad/downtempo song otherwise.

**frogaranaman** (4): why is this song trying so hard to be indie pop

**jayjaysortagay** (4): can we get to Ariana now thank yew

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): boring

**nick1372** (4): Completely forgettable

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (4): forgot i was listening to music during this

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Oh, yeah, this exists. Anyway, Vanessa Carlton did it better.

**wasian-invasion** (3.5): yeah this is a pretty unnecessary song

**radiofan15** (3.2): This is such a bunch of noise trying to form a coherent melody with lyrics she could have (and probably wrote) on her sleep... such a shame

**kappyko** (2): i didn't process this song

**RandomHypnotica** (2): This is so boring like wow

Lizzo’s themes are insanely consistent in Cuz I Love You. It’s so strongly rooted in loving yourself, others, and getting over love, and it’s from a voice mainstream pop isn’t really used to. A big black effeminate woman (acknowledged by her, herself), and she is the most refreshing thing we’ve had musically in a long time. 

It’s an interesting counterpart to Billie Eilish’s own rise in 2019, both are the closest to exact opposites, yet are matching each other’s hits and each getting massive recognition for their work in the form of cultural impact, awards, and chart performance. 

Soulmate is another piece of these themes, sometimes your favorite person can, and sometimes *should* be yourself. 

---

**JMez2613** (11): I've been waking up to this song at least twice a week since last April, and I have yet to be sick of it.

**wardrum5** (11): Please rise for our national anthem

**agentofscranton** (10): i'm surprised this hasn't been a single

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I need to remember to listen to this whenever I start spiraling down. It's a life-saver.

**fadedblue09** (10): The first non-single track I've heard from her, and easily became one of my favorite tracks from last year (even though it never encouraged me to the whole album oop). A very fun, wholesome self-loving bop. Easily the most relatable song on the album.

**lilacsweetener** (10): Loooove everything about this.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): queen of being a queen and not needing no crown (sry Billie and Taylor). and yeah if i were Lizzo i'd marry myself too.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Lizzo is such a positive presence I hope she sticks around for the long haul.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): those first few bars are kinda incredible? How did I not like this song the first time around?

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): This song always catches me off-guard. I don’t think about it much and I always forget about it, but that just means I’m pleasantly surprised by it whenever I listen to the album. I think it just lacks some kind of trait to distinguish it from the other songs on the album, so it doesn’t *stand out*, but whenever I pay attention to it I have to acknowledge it’s actually one of the best on the album.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Lizzo flexing her ability to skate between genres, a power-up anthem for Kraft Singles like me

**AnimationJava** (9): A great showcase of her power-vocals.

**Anthony-Vince** (9): Sounds like Meghan Trainor on steroids but that's not necessarily a bad thing

**cremeebrulee** (9): yet another banger ….. these first 4 tracks are really trying to murder me they’re all so good

**hadea0090** (9): yes i do the cooking yes i do the cleaning

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): i love this energy

**rhyneston3** (9): Ugh this album just makes me feel so good so far!

**Mysario** (8.7): this song can mate with my soul

**1998tweety** (8.5): It bops a bit, it's nothing special but it's fun.

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): This is such an amazing song to do lipsync for your life to at 2am in your apartment alone eating a sandwich and drinking wine

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): FUCK! a gemini!

**bandnitos** (8): i wish i felt this way about myself

**bespectacIed** (8): Great verses. Screaming "Look up in the mirror like damn, she the one" is so fun

**cleen\_claire** (8): A song about love that isn't also about masturbation we stan

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Lizzo's message of self-love doesn't feel preachy, and I can appreciate that.

**ggodisawomann** (8): bop

**ManofOranges** (8): Another bop on the album, but I'm not sure if it's because it comes after juice or what, but I just don't like it as much as some of the songs that came before it. Still not bad by any means though.

**nick1372** (8): the masturbation anthem we need in these trying times

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8): fuq i forgot how CATCHY this is

**waluigiest** (8): bop, good wordplay, and it doesn’t even queerbait us :-)

**wasian-invasion** (8): months of isolation is like marrying yourself right? Also those trill adlibs always get me

**radiofan15** (7.8): We get it Lizzo... you love yourself

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i support this but it makes me a little depressed because i don't think i'll ever reach this level of self confidence

**twat\_brained** (7.3): this was great right up until the one-word repetition in the chorus. It sounds like Work From Home done wrong

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): It's cute. Not my favorite of her songs but it's got a good message and I still like it.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It’s okay just slightly more corny and on the nose than I would like

**leviswift13** (7): okay why do i get the fame vibes ?? just me ?? okay cool

**meiscool132** (7): it's fun and I really like the message

**Nickl00** (7): she’s done better self love songs but it’s still not bad

**nooodisaster** (7): The verses are cute and quick and I'm a gay who grew up with EDM so I love a good one word drop. Only thing I don't like is the part where she sings Souulmate.. which admittedly is a huge part of the song.

**pearllouise** (7): My masturbation anthem

**skargardin** (7): DAMN SHE THE ONE

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): kinda "gendered yogurt commercial" material but catchy enough to survive

**untutorable** (6.5): bit of filler

**Agusarg** (6): A bit too basic as far as self-love songs are concerned

**akanewasright** (6): I am not this song’s target audience. Self-love always seems so goddamn weird to me. Like, I don’t hate myself, but I have never felt this strongly about myself. I feel bad rating this, because I know this stuff is important to some people, but I just don’t get it. And the hook is noticeably worse than a lot of the rest of the album.

**axestogrind** (6): This early 2010s energy is so strong this literally feels like a hit in 2011

**Kromorei** (6): :meghan:

**Stryxen** (6): sigh I wish this did something else

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): wish it had a better chorus

**vayyiqra** (6): extra fries > exercise

**vhqv1997** (6): The chorus is way too shouty for my taste but I do agree with the message here. Honestly if I met a clone of myself in real life I definitely would fuck him, and it wouldn't even be incest, cause we're both gay.

**anothertown** (5.5): reflection by fifth harmony did this mirror concept better, and that sucks

**runaway3212** (5.5): my least favourite on the album

**george\_kaito** (5): 2010 teas

**jayjaysortagay** (5): auto tune on a Lizzo album? No thanks

**kappyko** (5): good lyrics and i like the bounce part but yeah the verses suck here

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (5): sounds like a 00's reject

**LeninaCrowne94** (4.5): Good message but the production is too much

**alwayswords** (4): the autotune is tew much

**FluffyNobody** (4): Don't really like the beat and the rapping, sorry

**dreamingoutloud92** (3.5): chrissyteigencringe.gif

**mayolizard** (3): wow this is kinda bad. wow.

**bandnitos** (10): this deserves more than being a loose single

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is such a vibe. I didn’t really love it at first but it’s grown on me a lot

**Kanne\_** (10): one of my fave billie songs bye, also i'm gay and listened to this song during my last heartbreak bye

**meiscool132** (10): one of my favourites of Billie's for sure! the mellow tone of her voice really make this song perfect to me

**runaway3212** (10): This song seems pretty basic at first, but the more I listened to it the more I loved it.

**twat\_brained** (10): this feels like an English breakfast tea next to a window coated in rain on my bed wrapped up in a blanket. i enjoy this

**radiofan15** (9.1): Wasn't she like 15 when this was released tho?

**frogaranaman** (9): one of Billie's most underrated songs

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): ooh, this is a vibe

**materialqirl** (8.5): a vibe

**Mysario** (8.1): did I not rate this for the 2017 EP rate? I guess not

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): very chill, I dig it.

**waluigiest** (8): okay soft bop :-)

**rickikardashian** (7.9): i kept on looking at my tabs to check what video of talking crowds i had open while this played

**hadea0090** (7.5): smexy but it's too short

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): I have no comment on the song, but the single art looks like me trying to serve my blanket wrapped around me like a toga as a look.

**E3-NotTheConvention** (6.9): Nice beat kinda boring,tho

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this feels more like a don’t smile at me continuation than When We All Fall Asleep but its still cute

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): It's cute

**jayjaysortagay** (6): meh, I don't know why this is even here, it's a 2018 song.

**leviswift13** (6): okay but why aren't we rating my boy ??

**ManofOranges** (6): Fine enough but there's nothing that makes me go "wow." Also it's kinda weird to hear Billie's voice from a few years ago, like it hasn't been that long but there's definitely a clear distinction between then and now. It's kinda interesting.

**pearllouise** (6): Heart To Break but make it bitchy

**skargardin** (6): boppy but i dont relly care for it

**vayyiqra** (6): weird how a song with a title this edgy is this gentle but I'm kind of into it

**cleen\_claire** (5): it's just sort of nothing...

**fadedblue09** (5): A little generic and unremarkable. Piano outro was cute ngl.

**Kromorei** (5): okay i guess

**ggodisawomann** (4): no. I just. no. she is an artist I rarely ever find myself wanting to return to and when I do, it's really just bad guy and bury a friend...

**Nickl00** (4): one of the only Billie songs I don’t really like

**1998tweety** (3): The weird cuts take me out of it tbh

**puberty1** (3): this song was released when i was failing off the Billie train just because i thought she was gonna release sleepy songs like this for the rest of her life and boy was i wrong

**vhqv1997** (3): Billie ballads is the worst

**muchopartymuchomoney** (2): lowkey insufferable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): STOP PLAYING THE CROWD NOISE

**bespectacIed** (1): ugg li

**jayjaysortagay** (11): chills, definitely the best track in the rate. This is straight from Lizzo's soul to your ears. Have you seen that performance she did of this at the AMAs? Now that is singing damnnn

**AnimationJava** (10): I LOVE the sultry vibes of this song! Lizzo's blues voice is so pleasing to me.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): I remember hearing this song at Outsidelands when I had no idea who Lizzo was. This was totally one of my favorites that she played. She had soul singing it and I"m so glad it's not lost on the album version

**george\_kaito** (10): she served vocals, pt 2

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): If y’all knew how many times I’ve just sat down and sang this song beginning to end… An 11 contender, if I had two this would get it. I don’t even mind that the lyrics contradict themselves (she calls him ugly then later says she never said he wasn’t attractive, I’m just saying).

**JunkyGS** (10): a vocal PERFORMANCE

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i will never forget the day i watched her perform this at the AMAs

**rhyneston3** (10): Fuck u Jerome

**runaway3212** (10): Lizzo really nails this song

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Her voice is absolutely stunning on this one. It is placed well in the track list as a nice break in energy after the first four, and that placement elevates it

**wavingwolves** (10): jerome is a beautiful name and this song is magical

**bulforster** (9.5): The vocals are so good I wish I could give this a 10 but I just can't with "juicy parts".

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): take ya ass home and come back when you're grown. READ HIM FOR FILTH

**rsmitty99** (9.5): Sing bitch

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9.5): obsessed with this song, we don't get to see this side of lizzo enough

**cleen\_claire** (9): Lizzo's got a fucking great voice

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I remember when people were saying that Lizzo isn’t “soul” just LOOK AT THIS.

**untutorable** (9): this one is so good...... her vocals!!!

**waluigiest** (9): I remember hearing this on her Coachella livestream and I was FLOORED

**meiscool132** (8.5): Jerowned

**mms82** (8.5): her vma performance of this was amazing

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Great lyrics, a nostalgia heavy sound, one of the better ballads in this rate

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): looooooove when she just belts like that

**anagalisgv** (8): this beat is just soooo classic

**bandnitos** (8): this song got my mom to like lizzo

**hadea0090** (8): "take ur ass home" me to all u hoes going to the beach

**nick1372** (8): I wonder what Jerome is up to right now

**pearllouise** (8): The more I listen to this song I remind myself of the time she sang the song live and replaced "Jerome" with "Pedro" for a fan named Pedro

**Stryxen** (8): I like to just sway along

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): she really got possessed by michael jackson when she did those hee-hees

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): go off with them vocals lizzo

**TiltControls** (8): i thought this was leading to a slow dancing in the dark cover at first

**WeastofEden44** (8): Such a beautiful ballad, so glad that she shows multiple sides of herself on this album

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.9): It has the same tempo and beat of Love on the Brain (and probably other 187361 songs). I'm not complaining, sounds great :)

**Mysario** (7.9): thankfully Lizzo carries this vocally because instrumentally, this sounds like it could be from any boring and unsteady indie band

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): wow she really ended whoever is Jerome

**twat\_brained** (7.6): My voice feels incredibly hoarse and I'm not even the one singing

**1998tweety** (7.5): The emotion in her voice....so much. It doesn't hit as much as the previous songs but it's alright.

**radiofan15** (7.2): I'm sorry Lizzo but Rihana did this song better a couple of years ago and called it Love On The Membrane or something like that

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): Her vocals kinda falter at some notes, but that's also kinda the point. Fuck you, Jerome.

**ggodisawomann** (7): TAKE YA ASS HOOOOOMEEEEEE

**nooodisaster** (7): This song wants to be "Tyrone" soooooooo bad. And you know what, that counts for something.

**wasian-invasion** (7): tell him boy bye

**akanewasright** (6.5): She sounds great, and it’s certainly a memorable track (which is half the battle), but the first verse is just so goddamn mean. Like, I can get behind the second verse, but the first verse just puts a bad taste in my mouth. A lot of her shouted ad-libs also make the song a lot pettier than it had to be.

**Anthony-Vince** (6): Decent track but I always forget it exists

**bespectacIed** (6): cute

**leviswift13** (6): i don't get the hype i'm sorry i think the lyrics are funny but in an intentional way

**skargardin** (6): a little bit uneventful

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6): ffs jerome get it together

**FluffyNobody** (5): I like the concept on paper, but in practise, a ballad about a fuckboi ain't it

**kappyko** (5): i wish she was rapping here

**Kromorei** (5): idk?

**mayolizard** (5): iono. Production serve but i don't like the rest

**Nickl00** (5): I really don’t like slower ballady Lizzo

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): The melody is pretty good here

**fadedblue09** (4.8): Reminds me of Love on the Brain for some reason? Anyway, it lacks the punch and personality of her other songs so it's not really a highlight for me.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): Maybe i'm dumb but i don't understand the MJ heehees

**plantp0wer** (4): the chord progression sounds like creep i think

**vayyiqra** (4): good one Jerome you dolt you could've had a thicc bish

**ManofOranges** (3): This song is where it began to feeling like Lizzo does a lot of yelling on this album. I just think it would've been good to have a slower, more quiet song brea up the monotony or something here rather than having this song here. Because when I'm listening all I can think about during this song is when is the album gonna mix it up a little.

**vhqv1997** (3): The way she roasted him to shit in the first verse and said she never said he wasn't attractive in the second verse

**mudkip1** (2): this is just an inferior version of love on the brain wtf

As we are all well aware of, Ariana and ~~Dave Peterson~~ Pete Davidson had a very public mess of a relationship that ended as badly as we expected, and through *thank u, next* we learn that a big reason for the couple’s downfall were caused by Ariana’s own faults, for example, *ghostin*, *needy* and *makeup* showcase how she isn’t an easy person to date, so for a good part of the LP we empathize with ~~Pat~~ Pete, until *in my head* arrives, and **DRAGS** him through the mud.

It’s so honest and harsh it might as well be considered a diss track. She never really insults him much, but listening to your ex-fiancee sing about how she completely imagined everything good about you because she was trying to convince herself she likes you but then she realized how much of a piece of crap you really are must sting. ~~Paul~~ Pete’s response to this was mostly just him being bitter and making fun of her spray-tan on a bad Netlix special, so I think it’s fair to say he lost this round.


---

**meiscool132** (11): I live for the trap beats in this album, and the Pete Davidson drag, the wordplay, the vocals in the chorus and the overall self-aware but savage vibe of the song really make it one of my favourites ever

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (11): In My Head was the surprise grower from thank u, next. While most of my attention went to “Needy”, “Ghostin”, Or “NASA”, I didn’t really LOVE this one until the summer. But since July, it shot up quite significantly to be one of my favorites from the album. This is obviously about Pete Davidson, and Ariana learning and accepting that he isn’t who she wants him to be, and her coming to terms with that. The lyrics “Painted a picture, I thought I knew/drew you well.” highlight these emotions perfectly. Ariana very clearly saw herself and Pete as a happy, loving, stable couple and she did everything in her power to continue seeing it. There was this willful ignorance to both her and Pete’s flaws and traumas that permeated Sweetener that just isn’t present here. With the 20/20 benefit of hindsight, Ariana sees that it was never going to work and she most likely messed up both of their lives in order to keep up the facade. There are some brilliant lines here: “Caught up in the moment, tangled up in your sheets”, “look at you, boy I invented you. In Gucci tennis shoes running from your issues.” “They see demon/Cain I see angel/Abel” All of these lines share details of the breakup. But more so, they show us exactly where Ariana’s mindset is. She mistook amazing sex for a fulfilling relationship, she tried so very hard to see what she wanted to see, she even took credit in the public knowing who he is in the first place. And it all ended up crashing badly. But the real kicker comes in the bridge, where she realizes that Pete was never gonna be the man of her dreams and she doesn’t blame him for that at all. She knows that she rushed into an ill-advised engagement while still dealing with immense trauma with a guy who has his own demons that he needs to conquer. It’s honestly no surprise it ended so badly. And I think what makes this, and by extension the entire album, compelling is how open she is about her own faults. It could’ve been so easy to just blame Pete for the relationship failing and making the album about how much he hurt her, but she didn’t. She understood how her own failings and negative traits played a hand in the breakup and it would be disingenuous to erase them from the narrative. A true highlight from the album and a testament to ugly tabloid drama being a sure fire recipe for success.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (11): i (still) have so many feelings about this song. i think it's one of Ariana's most relatable songs as most people have been in a relationship with someone where the mental image you have of them is better than irl, and you stay hoping they'll change. the final verse hits hard and overall, this is v close to perfection for me.

**agentofscranton** (10): it's a bit of emotional whiplash from ghostin, but that doesn't stop this from being easily top 5 ariana songs.

**alwayswords** (10): /u/hikkaru will be dealt with… trust

**anothertown** (10): this is immaculate

**bespectacIed** (10): Most fun, entertaining lyrics of the album. Should win the rate

**cleen\_claire** (10): ari can write some amazing lyrics

**cremeebrulee** (10): one of my initial favorites and the song i revisit the most from this album. i think i just relate to it a lot.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): RELATABLE AS FUCK. It's also a bop and a half (the outro goes off hard).

**hadea0090** (10): Post-chorus>>>>>chorus

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is probably my favourite song off the album and it was my most listened to song last year. I just absolutely love everything about this. I think it get unfairly dragged (just like she drags Pete here lol). I love the lyrical play here and I think it’s one of the more under appreciated songs here.

**lilacsweetener** (10): Strongest song lyrically and the production is a lot of fun too. Probably didn’t belong right after ghostin though. The sort of song Rihanna could do in her sleep.

**mayolizard** (10): i really really really love the outro rap teehee

**nahaalne** (10): Some of the lyrics in here are one of my all-time favorites

**NotWith10000Men** (10): look at you, boy I invented you. read him for filth too ari

**rhyneston3** (10): Two tens in a row?? Woo this song slaps

**valus** (10): my "I got played" anthem! guess i did it to myself :)

**WeastofEden44** (10): Best song on the album no competition

**bandnitos** (9): THE LAST VERSE'S INSTRUMENTAL LIKE . GO OFF

**eeveefan01** (9): a good deep cut

**FluffyNobody** (9): "boy you wasn't budding" made me laugh hysterically when I first heard it

**george\_kaito** (9): enough with these random intros!!!

**jayjaysortagay** (9): including that voice note at the beginning is so raw woah, I like everything after too

**Kanne\_** (9): would have given it a 10 but don't like the "skrrt skrrt"

**strangergravityfalls** (9): this is like me throwing myself at the first person i see when i am grieving even if that person turns out to be like a valuemart version of the next person to play the joker

**Stryxen** (9): skrrt skrrt

**materialqirl** (8.5): gucci tennis shoes

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): The spoken intro is too long

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i wish she'd do this one live instead of just being an interlude

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8.5): boy i invented youuuuu

**axestogrind** (8): 'Look at you... boy I invented you' is THE moment, she is the one

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): I love the vibe this song gives off. An interesting look into Ari's complicated relationship with you know who.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): "My imagination's too creative / They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel / Without the halo, wingless angel" You have to give props to Ariana's self-awareness in this song.

**franch** (8): weak point of the album i think

**leviswift13** (8): the music video scared me

**mms82** (8): would be a 10 if it wasn't for the voice mail

**nick1372** (8): her best lyricism maybe ever

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): for some reason this feels like the least important song in the album, but she still kills it

**waluigiest** (8): look at you…. Boy I INVENTED you……

**Mysario** (7.7): this song ends the filler part of the album

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i hope this doesnt get destroyed because i think its cute but like, its not that good..

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.5): The most uderrated track on the album. The lyrics are very strong.

**1998tweety** (7): Overrated, its a step above most of the songs on the album but it still has elements that drag it down. The emotionless "skrrt skrrt" is the biggest offender and completely kills the song for me honestly. Besides that, it's actually quite good and probably would've gotten a 9.

**Anthony-Vince** (7): I go back and forth with this song, sometimes I love it, others I think it's boring and mediocre, so I'll just give it a score in the middle

**Evanbrooks324** (7): overhated but not a lot of specialty going on in this song

**nooodisaster** (7): Again, tu,n is basically a psychology textbook and therapy session in one. For me tho I don't vibe with this sound as much as the rest of the tracks.

rickikardashian: **pearllouise** (7): good for her

**PointlessBibliophage** (7): i play a supercut of us?

**vhqv1997** (7): I still get nightmares from time to time about her horrendous video for this song. Fashion brands really be putting the worse visuals out there and we're supposed to just sit and clap.

**radiofan15** (6.9): SKRRT SKRRT but make them s.a.d.

**cyborglilith** (6.5): gucci tennis shoes

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): A more interesting Troye Sivan feature than “Dance To This”

**puberty1** (6.5): i really like the lyrics of this song but not a big fan of the production tbh

**runaway3212** (6.5): Ariana's voice cannot save every song no matter how hard she tries.

**akanewasright** (6): I’m sorry, but this song is ridiculously overrated. I never skip it (it’s too important to the album to skip), but I do not know what y’all see in it.

**CarlieScion** (6): why do I feel like this could have been on lemonade [and have been done better by miss b]

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): There is so much going on instrumentally, like gorl.

**Nickl00** (6): her vocals are good but it’s pretty forgettable

**rsmitty99** (6): I always found it shady to go from Ghostin to that voicemail. Idk. This song never did it for me. I'm trying to put my finger on it. I can't.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): Meh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): the pre-chorus is so so good and got me excited for what was gonna come next but then it just turns into a generic hip hop song like ok

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): I love this sound, but the song itself isn't really interesting

**skargardin** (5): this trap beat is so uninspired and aside from the hook, there's not much to gawk at

**AnimationJava** (4.5): I'm still not sure why this was given some promo while the other songs were paid dust.

**bulforster** (4.5): The rap tropes incorporated here are very weird, like "skrrt skrrt" is not something that can be used forlornly.

**fadedblue09** (4): It gets some points for occasionally interesting lyricism, but overall it’s very unremarkable and it doesn’t hold up with the rest of the album.

**kappyko** (4): you're living with a virgin in your head

**ManofOranges** (4): Another song that I just don't care for.

**vayyiqra** (4): Maybe it's all in my hea-ee-yead (yuh) but that looping sample during the verses is really annoying and distracting.

**plantp0wer** (3.5): I don’t like that noise in the background, it’s kinda boring too

**RandomHypnotica** (3): why THIS got a video i will never know

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): I kind of hate the “scroo scroo!” part

**wavingwolves** (3): i miss having my friends over. the only part of this song i like is the "boy i invented you" line because her delivery is so good

**muchopartymuchomoney** (2.5): i get the point and the idea is cool but this song just fucking bores me.

**ggodisawomann** (2): this song is ass and I skip it and I cannot believe she gave this a music video PLEASE

**Kromorei** (2): i hate this fucking song.

**hikkaru** (0): boring production boring melodies and the weakest "skrrt skrrt" i've ever had the displeasure of hearing

**twat\_brained** (0): this song is the most boring in the rate to me thus far. All the others at least have something to hold on to. Not this.

**eeveefan01** (10): Improves the original

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is cute as hell fuck y’all

**patcheso8** (10): I really like the addition of Ari!

**wasian-invasion** (10): idk why people dont like this version ari sounds so relaxed and carefree

**dreamingoutloud92** (9.5): Plus .5 for Ari

**anagalisgv** (9): this is cute

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I think I am the only one who liked this remix. Ariana gave a lot of life in this song tbh.

**ggodisawomann** (9): Ari kinda unnecessary on this but her vocals beautiful anyway

**ignitethephoenix** (9): it’s not bad but it doesn’t add anything (like most remixes here in the bonus rate)

**lapascalia** (9): Might be a hot take, but I prefer the remix to the original. I find that the song works better with 2 singers, they both sound great on this!

**strangergravityfalls** (9): why aren't we rating the AB6IX version

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.8): I actually like Ariana in this

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.5): Idk if it was intentional or not but Ariana lacked energy, still love how sweet her voice sounds

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): the frustrating thing is that this COULD have been good but also it’s not bad enough for me to hate it, so it’s just like, *there*

**materialqirl** (8.5): WIG!

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): The only thing Ariana really adds to this is her name as a featured artist. The song itself is still good though

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the way it feels like ari picked a completely random spot in the song to start singing

**bespectacIed** (8): Thank god they both have great vocals cuz this remix is so uninspired

**cleen\_claire** (8): Ari doesn't add much but it's nice

**lydiatill** (8): Fitness: 6

**nick1372** (8): At least it didn't make the song worse

**rickikardashian** (8): i honestly feel like they had ariana record just the legal minimum needed to release the same track with “ft. Ariana Grande” in the title and boost the streams of this

**fadedblue09** (7.8): Not that bad, but not really essential. Ariana's contribution feels muted IMO.

**meiscool132** (7.5): they sound really nice together, and fit seamlessly imo, but in a song like this I feel like a powerful soulful voice like Lizzo is needed.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): This is actually a pretty decent remix

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): Ariana is here, and that’s really all there is to say about her on this song

**abysmalglimmer** (7): it kinda works I think

**bandnitos** (7): ariana sounds bored

**hadea0090** (7): do people not know what a remix is [2]

**mayolizard** (7): this is superior idc

**vayyiqra** (7): it's the same as the original but some lines are by arianuh it's okay idk

**FluffyNobody** (6.5): 2019 really was the year of unnecessary features, eh?

**plastichaxan** (6.5): pointless but fun

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): works better than the other remixes in the rate but that is the lowest of bars

**WeastofEden44** (6.5): Slightly above useless, I expected more tho

**Mysario** (6.4): this remix made me appreciate how powerful Lizzo's vocals are. yea sure, Ariana can hit a bunch of high notes, but her voice is so subdued and held back that it makes her feel so tiny in this song. nothing wrong with that! or being tiny. or being big. oh god lemme rephrase

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): I never thought Ariana would ruin a song but.... Ariana ruined this song. Did she have a cold when she recorded this?

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): a concept: people understanding what the fuck a remix is.

**ReallyCreative** (6): MISSING: the point of this remix, if found, please return to the recording studio

**rotating3Dtext** (6): this is not a remix ladies

**Stryxen** (6): sure

**puberty1** (5.5): just like most of the remixes here, it's not bad, just unnecessary and shoehorned. i do like hearing ariana singing the "if he don't you love you anymore" part

**radiofan15** (5.3): This is "Britney Spears feat. Tinashe" levels of unnecessary

**leviswift13** (5): ariana didn't need to be here. was already good as is.

**ManofOranges** (5): I don't understand why Ariana is here! To me it kinda sounds like she's kinda checked out or something? I don't know but her presence is both underwhelming and unnecessary.

**Nickl00** (5): everything post monopoly just seemed to be a missed opportunity for Ariana

**rhyneston3** (5): Could have been so good!

**runaway3212** (5): I like Ariana and I like Lizzo, but together they are not great.

**waluigiest** (5): best remix in this rate, but I really don’t like that it feels like it diluted this song into a girlboss sorta anthem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): is this the most pointless remix ever? perhaps

**AnimationJava** (4): As much as I like Ariana's music, not much is really added by this remix.

**hockey\_newfoundland** (4): Ariana adds nothing to see this song, sadly.

**Kromorei** (4): kinda completely worse actually

**nooodisaster** (4): How you DON'T do a remix. coughsaysocough

**skargardin** (4): Ari's inclusion is barely noticeable, girl bye

**wavingwolves** (4): disappointing

**muchopartymuchomoney** (3): like with bad guy, and despite all the harassment Lizzo received for it by annoying Ariana stans, I'm really glad this version never got credited on the Hot 100. Ari doesn't add shit to this, and she doesn't fit the vibe of the song at all. she's so out of place it ruins the song.

**pearllouise** (3): meh doesn't really add anything tbh

**1998tweety** (1): Massive downgrade

**Awkward\_King** (1): its just so poorly fitting

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Fuck ariana big

**jayjaysortagay** (1): boot. Lizzo has big pussy energy and Ariana comes in like a fucking mouseketeer whispering at 5 decibels hate it. Sounds like they were never even in the same room.

**Kanne\_** (1): i gave goodbye my 0 or this would be it

**vhqv1997** (1): Zero harmony

This song is really as great as it is just because of the spoken word, which a lot of people didn’t like or took as not genuine. The mixture of career call backs, such as the direct relation to Red, and the culmination of a path that really felt non-existent up until the end, Daylight serves as a great album closer, but it comes a bit too late into the late game mess of Lover to really land all of its punches. 

The potential is here, but the last chapter seems unnecessarily “Taylor Swift” to feel impactful. If there was a way to go back and cut out a third of the album, and end on this note again, it may sting a little more, or leave a more savory taste, but now it just feels like a cherry on top of a spoiled milk shake. 

---

**FluffyNobody** (11): Despite the romantic tone, this is a self long song, and you cannot convince me otherwise. With a level of self-awareness regarding her mistakes, her preconceptions, her past that she rarely has shown, she closes the album with a song that is the definition of serenity. I love this song with all of my being, and since I started the rate, I'd always know it would get my 11.

**goldentayslight** (11): she. snapped. peruodt. the production abd lyricism. the other pop girlies wish

**Austine567** (10): this would be the 11 without the last spoken word part

**CarlieScion** (10): a fantastic end!!! Love the throwback to red and also the pre-chorus and bridge is *chefs kiss*

**cyborglilith** (10): incredible final track

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is the perfect ender for Lover. Daylight serves as an interesting contrast to I Forgot You Existed, in which she opened the album by playfully kissing off the things she went through a few years ago. Daylight is more of her bittersweet retrospect to those times. What both songs have in common is about moving on from the past. The Lana Del Rey inspired outro speech is a nice touch.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): A very powerful closer, and it would've made for a better title track than.. what we've got. The theme of "seeing daylight" in things, no matter how mundane they are, really is the glue that holds this messy album together.

**george\_kaito** (10): such a simple yet powerful way to summarize lover. the spoken outro is a bit cringy imo, but rest of it is just a vibe

**ImADudeDuh** (10): such a great album closer...

**Jimmy345960** (10): This song is beautiful and underrated. I love her.

**leviswift13** (10): this feels like the culmination of her career. i get very emotional talking about this song because it means a lot to me in a lot of ways. all i can say is you are what you love.

**moooo566** (10): beautiful closer. i too want to be defined by the things i love omg.

**nahaalne** (10): This would be my 11 if it weren’t for the monologue at the end which I skip every time

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): she had no right to attack us with the red callbacks like that

**SFbby** (10): I was just okay on this song until one day I was walking to work in the wintertime and it was damn cold and the sun was slowing coming up as the sunrise and this song came on and when the part "You gotta step into the daylight, and let it go" came on, I truly felt it in my bones and walked a little faster to get into the building for heat.

**skargardin** (10): A fantastic closer, much like afterglow i can't help but imagine that this is the song on the album that fits the most with the album cover, I stan

**TiltControls** (10): What a perfect way to end an album. If DBAC didn't already exist, this would easily get my 11.

**vhqv1997** (10): Definitely her best closing track of all time.

**Mazike** (9.8): underrated song

**runaway3212** (9.5): The only bad part of this song is the repeated "afraid of" in the spoken word part, why is that there?

**akanewasright** (9): A lovely conclusion to a flawed album that I really like.

**cremeebrulee** (9): i love the references to her red/reputation and how her perception of love has changed. this is a grower for sure, but i truly adore it as an album closer. the only thing that’s making me dock points is the cringe monologue, like stop!!! this song spoke for itself you don’t need to explain it lmao!!!

**dreamingoutloud92** (9): You are what you love? So am I Taylor Swift?

**twat\_brained** (9): only reason it's not a 10 from me is because Taylor's call is mixed more toward the right speaker more than the left

**1998tweety** (8.5): There are a few lyrics I could do without here but for the most part its a really nice end to the album. "I once believed love would be (black and white), But it's golden (golden)...., I once believed love would be (burnin' red), But it's golden" is an effortless career high. She really snapped with that one.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is a nice choice for a closing track.

**ladililn** (8.5): Thanks to Taylor teaching us all that we are what we love, I now identify primarily as bread and staying up until 5am reading a 100,000k fic for a show I haven’t watched in eight years.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): the red callback is so cute

**untutorable** (8.5): now that's a SONG baybee this makes me sad but also happy and peaceful in a way?? in a tracklist full of songs that do so little, this song actually makes me FEEL something. it's a great album closer and it's my favorite track on lover. i love the way she references her past eras, i love the spoken word ending. there's not much about this song i don't love. she's not quite a ten but she deserves this much

**wanderingimpromptu3** (8.5): It’s a beautiful joyful song, reminiscent of Clean. It needs just a little more edge

**WeastofEden44** (8.2): This is such a sweet song and a perfect closer to the album.

**AnimationJava** (8): If a summer morning could be a song, it would be this.

**Anthony-Vince** (8): Really it's a beautiful track, and on its own it's a 10/10 but the fact that there's a really long extended outro on it bumps it down a couple points because I'm never motivated to finish the whole song.

**bespectacIed** (8): Almost a 10 but I deducted 2 because that ending monologue is a heinous crime and one of the worst, fake-deep things that has ever come out of Tay's mouf

**cashewconstellation** (8): It's a very good song!

**hikkaru** (8): the callback to red :chefskiss:

**Kromorei** (8): it's rly good actually.

**ManofOranges** (8): It's a nice closer. I don't think it's terrific but it's more than capable of doing what it's meant to.

**nooodisaster** (8): The thesis. Great lyrics.

**pearllouise** (8): I can't come up with something witty for this song so I'll just say some random shit to make it look professional: Good morning, America. I'm excited to tell you on Tuesday morning March 29 that I'll be performing for the first time ever in a special concert in San Francisco's historic Castro district on Good Morning America. And I promise you, it'll be a morning to remember. See you soon. Would you hold it against meeee?

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This song didn’t really click for me until listening for the rate

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8): i think this is a great closer for the album, it's sweet and tbh the spoken words at the end could've been a great closer for the last album of Taylor's career

**waluigiest** (8): a very pretty closer. It had a lot of potential and was hurt by how long and unfocused the rest of Lover is

**wasian-invasion** (8): aw this is a nice closer. the outro gets me everytime

**wavingwolves** (8): tbh i love this song but right now it makes me feel very depressed because i feel exactly the opposite of it

**eeveefan01** (7.9): A great closer, anything that references RED gets my vote

**patcheso8** (7.5): a little boring and the 2nd verse is a bit word salady.

**Agusarg** (7): It's a cute closer, nothing special though

**bandnitos** (7): should've ended with it's nice to have a friend

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): A pretty but slightly forgettable closer. (Not as forgettable as London Boy though, just saying!)

**cleen\_claire** (7): It sucks that the album's so long, this song's good but I've been beaten down too much

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7): Nice, but quite boring tbh

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Possibly unpopular opinion, but the last minute should’ve been cut

**lilacsweetener** (7): Made me cry once when I hadn’t heard it in a while, toward the end where her background vocal says clear as day “I could never look away” and of course “step into the daylight and let it go”. Hugely emotional note to end on, very effective.

=====

rickikardashian: **rsmitty99** (7): I appreciate ending with a theme of love and "light at the end of the tunnel" vibes. But the production of this, Afterglow, and False God kind of blend together. I don't think she sticks the landing.

**franch** (6.5): this doesn't feel like it fits on this album really...

**Stryxen** (6.5): I want to be defined by the things I love 2 :) steam false god 💅

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.5): Mostly pretty. Some of the lyrics are too on the nose for me, but I love love the "I once believed love would be burning red" echoing on the background.

**radiofan15** (6.3): Why is this the album closer?

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): If with 'being defined by the things I love' Taylor meant her reputation, I think it adds up.

**lapascalia** (6): Don’t really care for it, could do without the speaking part at the end.

**Nickl00** (6): I think it’s ok as a closer but I kinda see it as a repeat if afterglow

**ReallyCreative** (6): A good choice for a closer but it's just not as good as Cornelia Street or False God so it feels like filler.

**rhyneston3** (6): An ok closer, could be better though

**vayyiqra** (6): Cute and wholesome :uwu:

**ggodisawomann** (5): underwhelming/boring but not bad

**J\_Toe** (5): some of the instrumentals sound like the backing tracks of Love, Simon (not the songs with lyrics, but the lyricless Jack tracks)

**jayjaysortagay** (5): too many songs on this boring ass album

**Johnnytoby** (5): lovuh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): Is this the best she could do for a closer?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): okay now onto the good stuff

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (5): goes on for too long and doesn't go anywhere

**fadedblue09** (4.6): Mediocre and overly long synthfest. Would've been better if this didn’t exist. Imagine how bittersweet it would be if the album ended with the previous track.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.3): this just screams filler like Kylie jenner's face

**Mysario** (4.3): the album ends so boring, I fall asleep before I can appreciate that voicemail

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): Honestly I can never remember how this song ends

**mayolizard** (3.9): the most BORING song here… oh my FUCKING GOD!!!! IM SLEEPING!!! Im so sorry, but zzzzz

**anothertown** (3.5): complete filler

**kappyko** (3): i never knew i never knew he could hold daylight in his hands

a white teenager that grew up in the middle class saying ignorant shit about rap music? color me shocked

---

**radiofan15** (11): When you got French Montana arriving at the studio in a Uber with fake jewerly and paying for all of that with fake streams then you know she made a point

**ImAMessyBitchDuh** (10): yikes sis. we hate this RACIST

**puberty1** (10): one of the biggest reasons that I really don't care about her outside of her music if I'm being honest

**Mazike** (9.9): Woke legend

**1998tweety** (9): where was the lie?

**hadea0090** (9): I wasn't expecting that from her tbh. I wonder if she saw the video fantano made 🤔 *(ricki note: no, she probably has a life)*

**ReallyCreative** (8): I do love some casual racism out of my white pop stars to keep the girls gagged. A hilariously dumb comment that got not enough attention tbh

**Agusarg** (7): Everyone got over it but it was pretty bad

**runaway3212** (7): I forgot this happend, but it was entertaining.

**vhqv1997** (7): This controversy actually has a decent conversation to have about it, but too bad the root of the matter is just that Billie is a dumb edgy teenager lol

**twat\_brained** (6.4): obviously not all of rap is fake, but Billie has been a rap fan for basically her entire life, so I believe she's coming from a place of sincerity and deep appreciation for the genre. Now, not all of her music is "real" either; she hasn't buried friends, taken anyone hostage or had friends who got too high that they drowned in lakes. It's far less on-the-nose than it is in rap, however.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Quote was taken out of context, but Billie isn't the right person to say this because rap music is a black genre and she is a white woman. I don't need to explain further.


**lilacsweetener** (5): pretty typical commentary from white artists unfortunately but also...she’s 18. Teens always say dumbass shit like this.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): the only one here i dont really remember...WHERE was "billie doesn't know van halen" on here *

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): ok billie "might seduce your dad" eilish

**bespectacIed** (1): We really shouldn't give a fuck about what a bougie little white girl who dresses like an early 2000s male rapper has to say about rap

**jimmy345960** (1): i dont even know what she would mean by this, why would you say this

I’m an absolute slut for key changes. Getaway Car, Crazier demo, Love Story, Perfect Illusion, anything with a key change gets proper marks from me, and this is no different. I gave this a 9, and the reason being is because of Jack’s voice. I love Bleachers, and I love Taylor, but I don’t think his voice needed to be here, and it throws my head out of how cute the song is for just a second. 

---

**moooo566** (11): the easiest 11 i've ever had

**Mysario** (11): this probably deserves a proper explanation. well, here it is: it's everything

**AnimationJava** (10): A top 2 track from Lover. It's a bit of a trope but I love the whole "i'd marry you regardless of our situation" kinda thing.

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Cute, fun, and euphoric! It gives me Avril Lavigne vibes which is probably part of why I love it so much. Also the key change!!

**Brendon-Urine** (10): YEEHAW ladies. this is the biggest bop on the album and I love it. and the lyrics in the chorus are so cute, makes me wanna be in love so bad everytime :(

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This is a rom-com in music form. Of course it's cheesy, it's what it's here to be!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The way so many people turned against this 100% unapologetic slice of pure poptimism baffles me to this day. As a side not, stream Kylie Minogue's most overhated album Kiss Me Once.

**franch** (10): honestly top 10 taylor songs of all time

**george\_kaito** (10): im a stay stay stay apologist

**hikkaru** (10): cute

**HolyGroundTS** (10): The slightly edgier Holy Ground

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Holy fucking shit this song is a motherfucking cultural reset. It’s so fun and poppy and sweet and its everything I would expect the Fearless era taylor would make if she was 10 years older and I love it so much

**Kanne\_** (10): it's very cute and it doesn't necessarily try and be something it is not

**leviswift13** (10): def the biggest grower for me on the album. first listen it was a cute 7, but now i get it and i get it so hard. it's soooooooo good and fun and girly and joyful and strangely emotional for me. the sincerity in her voice and the lyrics on the quiet chorus after the bridge brings tears to my eyes.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this is such a fun little bop. 11-worthy

**nick1372** (10): TAYLOR PLEASE MAKE A POP ROCK ALBUM I AM B E G G I N G YOU

**patcheso8** (10): so cute!!

**plastichaxan** (10): best Taylor song I've heard

**rsmitty99** (10): What a fucking INCREDIBLE SONG! Very reminiscent of fun punk rock back in the early 2000s. I can't emphasize enough how good Taylor is at writing catchy music. It flows out of her so easily and so frequently.

**runaway3212** (10): If this song was only the lyric "I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings" it still probably would be an 8, but as a bonus there's this whole song that comes with it.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): WHY wasn't this a single, it's so light, cute dance-able and the chorus is catchy and loud

**wasian-invasion** (10): taylor is that a weed? Im calling the cops! >:(((

**wavingwolves** (10): "i hate accidents except when we went from friends to this" is such a simple and effective lyric ugh i love it

**twat\_brained** (9.6): 80SLOR IS GREATLOR. THAT IS ALL.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.5): god I love the iCarly theme song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): this is everything that stay stay stay wanted to be and wasn't. also, can she make a pop punk album already?

**Awkward\_King** (9): it's so fun and j happy it's not the best song ever but it's not trying to be its cute and i like it

**CarlieScion** (9): I love speak now

**cleen\_claire** (9): This is the cutest shit a heterosexual has ever written

**kappyko** (9): this is good lol why do people hate this.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Sounds like the theme song To Jack Antonoff's sountrack to the straight version of Love, Simon

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is cute and I really like the different sound for Taylor. She pulls off this "rock-ish" style surprisingly well, I wouldn't want a whole album like this though.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): *The One Where Taylor Pretends She Won’t Get A Diamond Ring*

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): Country Taylor makes a return! Also is that a fade-out I hear? In MY 2020?

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): The key change is sooooo earned

**cashewconstellation** (8.2): It's the song I liked the most when I first listened to Lover and it still holds up. A bop.

**akanewasright** (8): This song is just too damn adorable.

**bandnitos** (8): i absolutely hated this song for months until i listened to it again and wow im sorry ms swift

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): I get the criticisms for this song but it's cute, dammit.

**bespectacIed** (8): One of the few people in this sub who don't hate this. It's so fun and preppy.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Paper Rings is basically Holy Ground's cute little sister.

**eeveefan01** (8): Taylor should do more like this

**FluffyNobody** (8): Sis when will you give us a pop punk album and a FOB collab

**ggodisawomann** (8): mmm

**ladililn** (8): Everybody seemed to love this song when the album first dropped, whereas I initially thought it sounded less retro and more dated, because I refuse to believe 2007 wasn’t yesterday. Now it seems like everyone’s gotten sick of it, but it's really grown on me! The verses are far and away the best part.

**lapascalia** (8): It’s cute and fun.

**Nickl00** (8): I really like this pop rocker sound but seems like it fits the album the least

**untutorable** (8): overhated! this is cute and boppy, sounds fresh and different among the rest of the tracks

**waluigiest** (8): this is just fun!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.7): This one is cute! It sounds like a B-side a cute concept girl group would put out, and that’s a compliment. Does the melody remind anyone of “Who Says” by Selena Gomez at times though?

**JanuaryFourteenth** (7.5): Reminds me of Colbie Calliat

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.5): I will defend this until I die

**mms82** (7.5): cute but a little to corny to like as a single person

**Stryxen** (7.1): we love a heavy metal moment <3 QUEEN of 100% pure uncut rock

**cyborglilith** (7): kinda annoying

**materialqirl** (7): lowkey lacking..

**nooodisaster** (7): I feel like this will get both 11s and 0s, and.... I can see both sides. It's literally just if hyper-upbeat catchy 00s pop-rock is your thing or not.

**pearllouise** (7): I'm Taylor Swift and you're watching Disney Channel

**ReallyCreative** (7): I loved this song at first but idk it just doesn't hit like it did on release

deleted: **rotating3Dtext** (6.5): “I like shiny things but I’d marry you with paper rings” hehe cute

**Jimmy345960** (6): Its nice, marijuana queen, but i get bored. I don't know why.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I usually like pop rock but the shouting just sounds kinda childish

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): the sense of happy corny fun in this song is both its biggest strength and greatest weakness

**CreepyMannequin** (5.5): very different but could have used some more work

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): another cute but annoying song. I think the chorus is way better than the verses for sure (the verses make me want to turn off the song)

**rhyneston3** (5): This chorus is exactly the same as the Man... which is better

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (5): just skip it

**avenueroy** (4.1): Listening to this makes me think I'm watching the opening montage of a Hallmark original movie. I like the concept, but the lyrics, performance, and production makes me feel just... sad and tired.

**ManofOranges** (4): I understand the sentiment. It's cute and she would marry this guy even if she had a ring made of paper. Fine. But in terms of sounding nice or at the very least interesting, the song is broke.

**mayolizard** (4): i hate this production and mixing, and well, the lyrics arent my favorite but the key change is cute

**anothertown** (3): another royalty free type beat? And a fade out? Come on Tay

**lilacsweetener** (3): As someone who loves people-watching, hearing all the small details of their relationship is super cute. But I hate the goofy bridge, kills the song for me.

**vayyiqra** (3): Oh no, I like this song a lot less than I remember. Taylor doing off-brand pop-punk is not what I want to hear. The lyrics are ... okay.

**radiofan15** (2.9): What is this Hannah Montana reject? When we asked for the Old Taylor back this is not what we meant!

**hadea0090** (2.5): so annoying and generic.

**jayjaysortagay** (2): it's not 2009 Taylor

**puberty1** (2): at least one of taylor's songs will be out day 1 and this will probably be it, right? please don't disappoint me, popheads

**TragicKingdom1** (2): stay stay stay teas

**Johnnytoby** (1.5): god when shes cheesy it hurts

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1.5): what is this disney original intro sounding ass song? a disaster

**Kromorei** (1): this song is honest to god fucking trash and i don't care to tell anyone that.

**cremeebrulee** (0): annoying. i hated this song from the get go. i gave it a couple of tries to see if it’ll grow on me but it’s gotten worse somehow. people will cut ME! and YNTCD from their playlists but this is the one that i have to cut first

**fadedblue09** (0): This is literally Stay Stay Stay, but twice as annoying and juvenile. I swear, I don’t get why people give this one a pass. Proof that this sub will literally suck Antonoff's dick no matter how mediocre the output is. Anyone who uses this as their proposal song deserves to be DUMPED and be single forever.

Annie Clark aka St.Vincent aka [](#annie) declared that after she had done *Slow Disco* Antonoff suggested her to turn it into a pop song, and she’s convinced Taylor was the one to give her the idea. I wouldn’t be surprised if the same situation happened with this song and Carly Rae Jepsen. Just like many songs on *Dedicated*, this feels like a bright spring day turned song. It’s cute and cheeky in the same way most Carly songs are, the major difference is that since this is a Taylor song, she actually gets the guy and isn’t singing platonically about unrequited love. This is everything *London Boy* wanted to be.


---

**Anthony-Vince** (11): Taylor's best song ever, I will not be taking constructive criticism

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE bop that'll unfortunately be robbed. The 2nd chorus is when this song kicks itself into overdrive with that "HEARTBEATTTTTTTT". The bridge into the last chorus good Lorde that is perfection. "So where we gonna go?, I whisper in the dark, Where we gonna go?" followed by Taylor belting "I THINK HE KNOWSSSSSSSSSSS" followed by "HEARTBEATTTTTTTTT" is one of her career highlights.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): I have a personal bias for this song, reminds me of a boy I was obsessing over (kind of low-key still am...). I miss the days before I lost my voice when I could sing that note (I probably always sounded awful but I didn't know FOR SURE, okay?) Also, funny story, the first time I heard this song listening to the Lover album, I was scrolling through facebook and I came across some weird video of cgi Sailor Moon and her gang having a dance off with cgi Dragon Ball Z characters and it fit PERFECTLY!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): [Taylor when she listened to Carly Rae Jepsen](https://tinyurl.com/tjqv4rm). And we're happy, because this is pop excellence

**CarlieScion** (10): THE BRIDGE ON THIS IS HEAVEN!!!! WHERE WE GONNA GO!!!! I THINK HE KNOWS!!!!!!!!!

**cleen\_claire** (10): This doesn't get nearly the amount of love it deserves

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I used to despise Taylor's falsetto(?) on here, but over time this has become my favorite on the album. It's perfectly structured and measured and makes me sad that I can't experience what Taylor is feeling in this song.

**ggodisawomann** (10): A CONTENDER FOR MY 11! this song is incredible and makes me feel so elated

**hikkaru** (10): can't wait for when i find someone that makes my heart beat skip down 16th avenue :pensive:

**Jimmy345960** (10): My fourth favorite on lover, the beat rocks

**lapascalia** (10): My favourite song on this album, oh my God.

**leviswift13** (10): anyone who doesn't like this song has the spirit of delusion within them. why wasn't this the first single?

**nick1372** (10): After listening to reputation, I thought I knew the two worst Taylor Swift modes: falsetto and white girl sing-rapping. Turns out if you have smart lyrics both of those are fine! This one is gonna be stuck in my head for eternity and I'm okay with that.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): sounds like carly, therefore amazing

**runaway3212** (10): This song really reminds me of 22 in all the best ways

**franch** (9.9): starts the best four songs on the album.

**Mysario** (9.6): BOP

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): The most underrated bop on this album! One of the few songs I actually revisit here still.

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9.5): the candy colored sequel to Blank Space that I never knew I wanted

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): get it in his pantssss girl

**berober04** (9): Carly loves you hun

**cremeebrulee** (9): this song is what y’all think cruel summer is. (also that meme about how taylor only dates bad drivers and in this song she’s finally the one driving sends me)

**FluffyNobody** (9): In a better universe, this was the lead single

**george\_kaito** (9): something about this makes me feel so happy

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This is genuinely one of the catchiest songs I’ve ever heard.

**pearllouise** (9): The breath control in the pre-chorus, girl. Eminem is shook.

**ReallyCreative** (9): The way this song builds and builds, a highlight for sure. I could see it unfortunately leaving day 1 though.

**skargardin** (9): Come THRU with the bridge and the breakdown into the final chorus! MAJOR bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): this is cute and fun

**WeastofEden44** (8.5): MOST UNDERRATED SONG ON THE ALBUM

**mms82** (8.3): 2013 country has nothing on this snaptrack

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I'm so glad Taylor went back to fun cheery music with this album

**akanewasright** (8): I can’t believe this wasn’t serviced to radio. It just seems like a natural fit. It’s a simple, cute bop that deserved better

**bandnitos** (8): this song is so fucking catchy like it's not super deep or anything but it's a bop

**cashewconstellation** (8): It's fun and I like it!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Lyrically, I can definitely see I Think He Knows to be the alternate lead single of Lover instead of ME! It definitely showed Taylor's low-key kinky side a bit and I felt like the public would be surprised at how openly flirty she is in this song. One of my favorite lyrics in the album has to be "I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans".

**eeveefan01** (8): A bop

**kappyko** (8): this sounds like Kimbra. i hate that intonation she uses to sound like she's laughing through her words but otherwise this is good. also i swear i've heard that exact pre-chorus rhythm from her before so :/

**lilacsweetener** (8): Grew on me a LOT. I thought this would be the fan fixation, not Cruel Summer. I look forward to the post-bridge spiralling drum beat with the bellowing “I THINK HE KNOOOWS” every time, and the sassy pre-chorus is so much fun.

**ManofOranges** (8): This song has grown on me. I hated it with a passion when the album first came out. I still don't think it's perfect but I've learned to at least appreciate it I guess. Not a fan of Taylor's high notes in this song either. To me they just sound grating.

**nahaalne** (8): Thought this was meh at first but the bridge and the final chorus really saves the whole song

**rhyneston3** (8): This is great! This album is impressing me way more than I thought it would so far

**waluigiest** (8): TWINK RIGHTS

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7.5): it's like "Want You in My Room" but not nearly as good

**plastichaxan** (7.5): one of the best yup

**wavingwolves** (7.5): car sex anthem

**bulforster** (7): I'm not really a fan of the prechorus' lyrics nor the all-falsetto chorus but the slow build to the last chorus is great.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): Perfectly fine, I guess?

**Johnnytoby** (7): why does she try to rap sing 🙁 otherwise this slaps tbh

**Nickl00** (7): I don’t love some of the vocals but still good

**rotating3Dtext** (7): jack just can’t resist making her sing like that

**Stryxen** (7): It doesn’t stand out, but I really like the sound and the lyrics are strong

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (7): little bit of a bop lowkey

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): here's the issue, i do really like this song everytime i do listen to it but it's so damn forgettable to me i dont know how, so i can't score this what i probably should

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): i can see why people love this song but it's not my fave. the last minute is great tho!

**radiofan15** (6.1): This is so... bland... Taylor could easily do these kind of songs on her sleep. That means is better than the average synthpop-esque song but Taylor puts such a high standard on her music that better-than-average is not always enough

**hadea0090** (6): mid

**NotWith10000Men** (6): "Ugh I mean" bugs the shit out of me

**vayyiqra** (6): Cute and kind of a bop, although with kind of boring lyrics. However, I love that white-women-sing-talking thing, so she's got me there.

**untutorable** (5.5): i don't care for this one much but the beat is nice

**avenueroy** (5.1): It sounds like a computer-generated CRJ song, and not in a good way

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): funny how every time taylor tries to rap it ends up making the song sound terrible?

In an album with a very unique production, *my strange addiction* is able to stand out as one of the strongest tracks. There’s no other experience like blasting this on a car, and feels how the bass shakes up your whole body. It’s shocking that this wasn’t chosen as a single, because this checks many of the boxes *bad guy* does. Amazing production, darker vibe, edgy-ish lyrics and a thunderous bass. The biggest problem/remark most people had with it was the use of snippets from *The Office*, since it does feel like a random addition with no meaning behind it ^(even tho I’m a firm believer that sometimes the only reasoning you need is “it slaps”).

#Comments that ignore the sample

**ggodisawomann** (4): I wish this went off a little more :/

**fadedblue09** (10): Ok this one's a moody jam!

**kappyko** (10): yes

**mayolizard** (10): one of my fav billie songs smash smash smash

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): Everything about this song is very good (melody, lyrics, production)

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): quirky in a great way

**Evanbrooks324** (9): wish this was a single, I feel like no one talks about this song

**Kanne\_** (9): hated the song at first, look where i am now lmao

**pearllouise** (9): this song deserved to be a single wtf billie

**Stryxen** (9): her lyrics are so Next Level

**akanewasright** (8.5): Sometimes I start the album from here because hot take, the second half of the album is better than the first, and why the album deserved the Grammy. Starting the half album with this absolute bop is pretty damn fun

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I just want this song to pop a little bit more and but it still goes off

**rsmitty99** (8.5): Again, these bass lines and drops are fantastic.

**avenueroy** (8.1): "Taking a break, not an oxford comma" fantastic, love it, great

**cleen\_claire** (8): full banger

**nick1372** (8): WHY wasn't this a single

**nooodisaster** (8): Kinda weird to have like a 12 year old sing this, but it bops hard.

**rhyneston3** (8): Probably my favourite album cut

**runaway3212** (8): I never really liked the office samples

**TakeOnMeByA-ha (7.5): sorry but whenever i see this title all i can think about is the guy who fucked his car**

**ImADudeDuh** (7): really weird

**Kromorei** (7): overhated

**vayyiqra** (7): Pop songs need to stop using addiction/drug cliches but nevertheless this is kind of a banger.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): this is the only song I don't really like, it feels like a shallow appeal at what's popular rn where the rest of the album is pushing culture forward on its own.

**Anthony-Vince** (5): It's kind of catchy but I think it's really overrated

**LeninaCrowne94** (4.8): Love the beat, but that’s about it

**bespectacIed** (4): I like the beat

#I don’t know if you guys noticed, but she actually samples The Office in this song

**ceebs\_** (10): for putting the office in there its strange but she's deserves a dundie for it

**cyborglilith** (10): I haven't done that dance since my wife died

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's Billie, bitch. *(ricki note: i hope you know that this inspired a shitpost. thank u)*

**frogaranaman** (10): one of the few good things The Office has brought to society

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Michael Scott is a main pop girl! Okay now that I’ve said that, this is one of my favourites from the album and it’s a bop.

**lapascalia** (10): As an Office fan, she won me over with this one!

**ManofOranges** (10): This is one of the few other songs on this album that I really like. It's catchy and enjoyable, yadda yadda yadda just imagine all the regular shit that I say going here. Only question I have about this song is why are there sound bites from the Office? I guess it's because Billie is like a fan or something? Is she saying the Office is her strange addiction? That would make sense I guess. Unsurprisingly, I don't quite know!

**Mysario** (10): this is probably gonna get unnecessary hate because My Personality Is The Office, I'm The Jim To Your Pam but this is absolutely my favourite from the album with its production and sound and lyrics and ughhh everything! the sampling may be overused but I think its really well done

**radiofan15** (10): Random Steve Carrell samples aside, this is FANTASTIC... why wasn't this a single?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The Office(5/5) + Homemade Dynamite (5/5) = my strange addiction (10/10)

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The Office sample is honestly what makes this a 10 for me and I haven’t even seen much of the show, it just works so well with it

**WeastofEden44** (10): I might give this song my 11 if it weren't for the completely unnecessary Office clips

**alwayswords** (9.5): the office samples add flavor idc idc

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): the office samples are very "lOoK aT mE Im WhItE AnD quIrKy" but i cant talk i like the samples a lot so im the problem

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): looooool those office audio clips are A Choice. i still really enjoy this? it works strangely enough

**anagalisgv** (9): this song would be a 10 if it weren't for the office samples

**bandnitos** (9): i hate the office

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): We have reached a point in pop culture where a young artist like Billie can now sample "The Office" on a song. Now, can we get a song where it sampled "Parks and Recreation"? Thanks.

**J\_Toe** (9): I love the fan edit syncing it up to clips from the Office

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I can’t even be mad at “The Office” samples, lord knows I’d do something similar if I were a famous singer.

**nootnoot781** (9): steve carell main pop girl

**skargardin** (9): banger! the office sample works in some fantastically weird way

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): The office samples make it

**twat\_brained** (8.4): liking the office is not a personality trait.

**anothertown** (8): it’s a bop and the office scenes are so randomly chosen that it is funny actually

**leviswift13** (8): i mostly just love the office.

**bulforster** (7.5): The Office samples are just a bit distracting, I get that they're here because it's her real addiction but that makes the song comedic in a way that cheapens it.

**ladililn** (7.5): I don’t mind weird gimmicks if they’re used purposefully, but I honestly can’t tell what the Office clips are there for other than shits and giggles. Without them, this song is a 9.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): this is catchy af but ruined by the extra voices talking ugh

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): not that sure how the office clips tie in but im impressed she got the approval for this

**AnimationJava** (7): If The Office samples were removed from this song, :chefskiss:

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): The Office samples are... a choice. But the production in this track kinda overpowers her voice a lot.

**dreamingoutloud92** (7): When will your fave sample The Office?

**hadea0090** (7): the office clips kinda ruin or make it i can't tell. Should've been a single tho.

**Nickl00** (7): the office gimmick is funny but I wish it didn’t take up as much time as it does

**NotWith10000Men** (7): it would honestly get 2 more points w/o the office bits. Fuck the office parks & rec is far superior justice for lil sebastian

**untutorable** (7): the office sample sends me that's one of my fave eps of the later seasons

**vhqv1997** (7): I would have thought that Billie's obsession with The Office was cute if she hadn't put a sample of it in her song for no reason.

**waluigiest** (7): I like the song but am so over the office sample lmaoo

**wavingwolves** (7): while i don't like the samples i still like the song overall

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (7): love the office but i don't need it in my music

**1998tweety** (6.5): It's ok, I feel like it's mostly riding off of the Office samples when in actuality it's a weak song.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): I'm the one person in the world who never understood the Office. I definitely don't understand why it's in this song (that's supposedly about a person and was inspired by the reality show?)

**CritneySpearz** (6): I’ve never watched The Office, but this makes me not want to watch it… those parts kinda ruin the song :(

**george\_kaito** (6): the office is overrated

**plastichaxan** (6): liking the office should be punishable for straight people

**sandyfishnets** (5): do the scarn

**static\_int\_husp** (5): that Office sample is bad

**TiltControls** (5): I need to watch The Office at some point

**franch** (4.5): why is there a "the office" clip? what even is this song


**hikkaru** (4): i hate the office and i hate that this sounds like a dj mustard beat

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.4): The sample on this is weird but honestly the song is nothing special without it.

**selegend** (2): sampling threat level midnight is not a talent

**shhhneak** (1): sampling The Office, really?

**ggodisawomann** (10): bop bop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song is mad underrated, it’s so smooth and chill. I’d love to hear Ariana over some genuine lo-fi hip-hop beats to chill and study to.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I am honestly surprised how much I like this collaboration. Social House definitely had great chemistry with Ariana here.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song was under appreciated tbh, it’s the perfect chill disposable chill out track.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): very nice production and vocals, catchy.

**rhyneston3** (9): I really like this

**runaway3212** (9): This song is awesome, I love it!

**wasian-invasion** (9): yeah it’s just like thank u next but...

**materialqirl** (8.5): it was a moment, yuh

**1998tweety** (8): Bops a little tbh.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): cute and inoffensive, but I guess that’s why some people don’t like it cause it’s low effort

**ManofOranges** (8): I remember disliking this a lot more when it came out for some reason? I don't know why, it's generally nice, it's pleasant to listen to. I think the instrumental at the beginning sounds just a lil like an asthmatic accordion, but that doesn't mean it's bad! Also I love how the notes after "I know we'd be so complicated" sound.

**nick1372** (8): It's kinda cute!!

**Tedyonce** (8): i know its lowkey a "thank u, next" ripoff but its a lot of fun and the opening line is iconic

**fadedblue09** (7.8): Pretty dope, but sounds too much like a clone of the thank u next title track.

**AnimationJava** (7.5): A quality song! I still find it very sassy and fun, it would've done better if Ariana had included it as a track on thank u, next instead of releasing it as a one-off.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): Everyone keeps comparing this to thank u, next for some reason? I don't see it, just like I don't see the chemistry between the three of them.

**meiscool132** (7.5): I realised the other day this sounds like Knew Better/Forever Boy and I haven't been the same

**Mysario** (7.5): yep, that sure was meant for radio

**Clearer-Skies** (7): a grower

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7): It isn't really bad...in an universe were we never know about tun's existence

**eeveefan01** (7): Hard to remember this

**ReallyCreative** (7): I like it, but I don't know that I'd listen to it again

**WeastofEden44** (6.8): This song is cute but she should have released a better song

**radiofan15** (6.4): Why is this basically thank u next with a lazy chorus and unnecessary features?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): i always forget this was even released even though it was a top 10 hit

**bandnitos** (6): im a motherfucking train- thomas the train theme song

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): Thank U Next two point oh.

**cremeebrulee** (6): i still don’t understand why she released this. stream boyfriend by big time rush instead

**Nickl00** (6): pretty generic but not bad

**nooodisaster** (6): very average ari single. she shoulda just slept tbh.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): uh it's there I guess

**vayyiqra** (6): is this the sequel to break up witcho gullfrenn where he does in fact break up with her and they find out why that was in fact an awful idea

**wardrum5** (6): Let's do the Thank U Next beat again but add a male feature on it. Still mad she did this instead of pushing NASA or Bloodline

**wavingwolves** (6): i don't hate this

**bespectacIed** (5): thank u next ctrl C ctrl V

**cleen\_claire** (5): this is just thank u, next if it was bad

**hadea0090** (5): thank u next wants its hook back

**leviswift13** (5): i listened to this song.

**mayolizard** (5): aged like milk

**puberty1** (5): the fact that Justin has a better song with the same name (and Selena too ofc) is not a good look

**skargardin** (5): Eh

**Tolk1en** (5): I'm giving 4 points for my love for Ariana, and 1 for the nice music video, but overall this is not

**waluigiest** (5): it’s chill but not interesting or really very good

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.5): Catchy enough

**frogaranaman** (4): it's just "thank u, next" again

**Johnnytoby** (4): Selana gomez wins this one

**selegend** (4): ari’s part is quite good. those guys are nails on a chalkboard

**static\_int\_husp** (4): This song's a fucking trainwreck

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): pretty much all her loose singles and bonuses from this era just sound like tu,n rejects to me and not the kinda stylings im too here for

**ladililn** (3.5): Every time this song comes on I fall asleep.

**FluffyNobody** (3): My god what a snooze

**hockey\_newfoundland** (3): I feel like the singles Ariana released post-TUN had little effort put into them and weren't overly enjoyable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gSzVbMePGg

**Kromorei** (2): if we wanted a tun reject we'd listen to a madison beer song

**CarlieScion** (1): this song is a motherfucking trainwreck

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): a motherfuckin' train wreck

**pearllouise** (1): boring lame same same same camp camp same next

**sandyfishnets** (1): nope

**vhqv1997** (1): In a parallel universe, break up with your girlfriend and 7 rings bombed, and Ariana had to pivot back to making songs that sound like honeymoon avenue and in that same universe, Hong Kong gained democracy. None of these correlate with each other and don't even relate to how I feel about this son. But this song really is bland.

This is a confusing song lyrically. Apparently it is about climate change, I think, but the chorus isn’t that related to that… Anyway, it slaps. It allowed Billie to keep on furthering her brand as the edgy and dark teen girl of pop music, and it shows she and Finneas have some huge balls to have sent this song to radio while it includes the phrase “All the good girls go to hell, ‘cause even God herself has enemies”
---

**agentofscranton** (10): it's kinda disney villain and i live for it, i can see maleficent popping her puss to this

**cyborglilith** (10): one of the performances for this gave me life i dont remember which one

**george\_kaito** (10): satanic queen

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): My favorite song on the album. The hip-hop beat with the piano works really well, it’s so slick and easy to listen to, and “my Lucifer is lonely” is one of the best delivered hooks in the rate. I also really enjoy how ambiguous the lyrics are and how you can read the song multiple different ways. Who exactly is singing the song? Whose side are we supposed to be on in the story she’s telling?

**kappyko** (10): yes

**ManofOranges** (10): This is fun to listen to and in my opinion one of the best songs on the album. Also the title to this song sounds like the most unlikely sequel for all dogs go to heaven.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song makes me thing Billie should make some rock tracks, she’d be pretty great at it.

**Stryxen** (10): yes yes yes!!!!!! I didn’t even realise this was under three minutes.

**Tolk1en** (10): a masterpiece, the beat, the atmosphere, the vocals, the instrumentals, the production, every piece of the puzzle comes together perfectly. The amazing music video is the cherry on the cake.

**ladililn** (9.8): The snowflake bit at the end kills the mood and keeps this from being a 10 tbh.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): god she and finneas just have such an ear for production

**mms82** (9.4): i love the fry on my lucifer is lovely

**Awkward\_King** (9): id listen to this song more if i was less scared of people thinking i was a local

**Brendon-Urine** (9): This is one of the songs that really shows how talented Finneas is

**cleen\_claire** (9): climate change activist billie eilish!!!!!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): GREAT SOCIAL COMMENTARY AND PRODUCTION HERE.

**dreamingoutloud92** (9): The production is super slick.

**hikkaru** (9): bassline fucks

**rsmitty99** (9): Every once in a while, these songs' instrumentations are brilliant. Especially this song

**twat\_brained** (9): love the song. Don't love the video because she's working with a higher budget than bellyache or Ocean Eyes yet it's somehow less interesting

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9): Catchy, good production, lyrics just slightly don’t make sense

**Mysario** (8.6): Good Girls Go Bad ft. Leighton Meester outsold

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i like it. its got an interesting story to it and i like that billie is more experimental with the topics in this album than the other albums in this rate

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A very welcome change of pace! Definitely a sonic standout.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): banger

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.1): That bassline is pure gold

**akanewasright** (8): This has been a grower for me. I didn’t love it at first, but it highly really slaps.

**AnimationJava** (8): We love a bop about climate change! A Gen Z queen.

**bandnitos** (8): my mom does not enjoy this song

**CarlieScion** (8): bop

**jayjaysortagay** (8): the lyrics are such a gag, I love it.

**Kanne\_** (8): i dont like the "all the good girls go to hell" but the rest i love

**untutorable** (8): a little more upbeat than most of her songs and it works for me tbh

**vayyiqra** (8): A climate change banger! She beat Grimes to the punch by almost a year, too. (Collab now please.)

**vhqv1997** (8): This is the cringiest song about climate change I have ever listened to, except for Earth I guess. Thank God Phineas pulled through.

**waluigiest** (8): she snapped with the lyrics

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is good but it’s just not one I come back to as much as some other tracks here

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): Finneas saying this song was about climate change feels ?? since its just not really there in these lyrics, but the song is good anyway so who cares

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is kind of funky, but I also feel like it could be giving more.

**Anthony-Vince** (7): Catchy song, but I don't replay it all that often

**hadea0090** (7): I want to hate this but i don't hmmmmmmm

**Kromorei** (7): song is good but it triggers me

**nick1372** (7): cool concept but execution is pretty vague

**pearllouise** (7): Billie just told me to go to hell. That was the nicest thing I have heard all day.

**runaway3212** (7): not the best on this album

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This is the most forgettable song on the album for me

**skargardin** (7): boppy but not as hard of a bop as the biggest bangers on the album

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i like the almost-groovy style of the beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): my religious mom really likes this song for some reason

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (7): solid song but its overshadowed by the other singles

**mayolizard** (6.5): idk ive never felt it

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.3): Well, a teenager definitely wrote this

**radiofan15** (6.3): very funky and upbeat, at least by billie's standards... not very memorable tho but at least it sounds nice

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): I'll give her credit for writing a song about something a lot of people don't care to touch.

**bespectacIed** (6): Creepy, enjoyable mv. Love the piano, and the bass but that's about it, Billie's voice and delivery are so unbearable

**Nickl00** (6): everything about this is just kinda ok

**nooodisaster** (6): ALL of them?

**puberty1** (6): not bad but it exemplifies a lot of my issues with Billie's songs where it's just so chill that sometimes it doesn't go anywhere

**rhyneston3** (6): Especially after You Should See me in a Crown, which did everything this song tries to do but better

**WeastofEden44** (6): Bleh, not her best

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): Billie really said God is a Woman, a much better song.

**plastichaxan** (5): what about the girls that would like the album much better without this :(

**ggodisawomann** (4): I kinda relate but like meh

**ImADudeDuh** (4): why tf was this the follow up to bad guy

**leviswift13** (4): this makes me uncomfy.

**Johnnytoby** (3): hate cheesy piano songs sorry billy

I wanted to love this, and I did for a bit, but as I kept relistening it started wearing more and more on me. It’s cute, and it is a fun bop for Ari to release, but it never hits the upbeat happiness of a Lizzo track or the emotional depth of Billie or the extra bloatedness of Taylor to really stand on its two feet for me. 

---

**cleen\_claire** (11): PERFECT mix of upbeat bop and depressing ass sad shit

**bandnitos** (10): sad peace signs

**cashewconstellation** (10): Amazing. One of my favorite songs of 2019.

**eeveefan01** (10): a smooth jam

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This song perfectly captures that moment when my anxiety attack starts shifting into a depressive episode and I love that for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait, maybe she snapped

**J\_Toe** (10): the trust answer to Sweetener

**lapascalia** (10): Damn this is a great song.

**leviswift13** (10): got me through some emotional breakdowns and that's on a therapy, luv.

**mms82** (10): the best album track on the album by far, after laughter comes tears into the trappy beat is fantastic and such a gem

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Remember when she didn’t have any tears left to cry?

**Nickl00** (10): I think the sample really brings the whole song together but it’s also one of better written songs on the album

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the chorus sounds so different from the verses, I love it

**rsmitty99** (10): I had a really bad break up a few months before the release of this album. Then he started sleeping with another dude that was in our shared friend group so I ran into them a lot at parties and get-togethers (they end up dating. They're still together). Felt pretty betrayed and it hurt a ton. But for a good month or two I acted fine. I didn't wanna cause drama. So I put on that fake smile and acted like I was cool. I wasn't. This song got me through those hard months. Felt like I wasn't alone.

**Stryxen** (10): ariana you’re doing amazing sweetie

**bulforster** (9.5): If she needed another single I would've made it this.

**franch** (9.5): ari has endured more heartbreak in 2 years than many and this song encapsulates it so well for me

**hawksband** (9.5): just nod and fake smile yall

**mayolizard** (9.5): fucka

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): love love love not only the song but the meaning behind it as well. i can’t think of too many celebrities who’ve had to deal with as much shit as ariana and i can only imagine what it must be like to be her.

**Anthony-Vince** (9): Beautiful song

**fadedblue09** (9): This is what most of the deepcuts should’ve sounded like. This one showed another side of Ariana’s feelings of grief and coping without sounding like a rehash.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (9): relatable

**nick1372** (9): this is the point in the album where you really realize how much shit ari has been thru

**nooodisaster** (9): Honestly this makes me sooo emotional. Some of the best lyrics on the album, so personal and underneath, tragic.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8.8): this song is such a great follow up to No Tears (was it meant to be one??)

**WeastofEden44** (8.7): I initially wasn't huge on it but I've seen the light and love this song now

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.3): I love the melody in the verses, the sample, the bridge...

**AnimationJava** (8): My favorite song during release week although it aged a bit poorly.

**CarlieScion** (8): the verses do be popping tho

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): It's hard to comment on some of these tracks because fuck, the lyrical content is very good, but also extremely personal.

**cremeebrulee** (8): i really loved this song off a first listen! i think i do understand when people say there’s a lot going on but i think the chaos adds to how alone she’s been feeling

**dreamingoutloud92** (8): Lyrically this album is a lot more interesting and personal than I thought it would be.

**Evanbrooks324** (8): , never really got the hate for this song I think the lyrics are cute

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I really like the lyrics in this one but it’s not one I revisit as much. A big mood though

**JanuaryFourteenth** (8): It’s the better version of every song on Reputation

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8): couldn't hear what she was saying for so long but it still goes off

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.9): Shoutout to those magical uUuuUuUhhhs and that chill chorus!

**akanewasright** (7.8): This song does not stand on its own at all, but I really love it in context of the albums.

**Mysario** (7.7): lyrically it's nice but I also kind of forget this is on the album most times

**anothertown** (7.5): bop!

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): poor ariana

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.1): This song is very cute, don’t love the spoken word bridge

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): Don't really know what to say about this song. It's good.

**bespectacIed** (7): cute hook

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the themes and lyrics of this song but the melody is just all over the place.

**hadea0090** (7): a little repetitive but the sentiment behind the lyrics is really well done

**jayjaysortagay** (7): bit generic unfortunately, I love the vocal riff on the chorus which brings it up for me.

**kappyko** (7): i imagined myself as a rich woman dancing around my wide mansion listening to this

**ManofOranges** (7): I think song sounds nice but there gets to be a point during it where I just begin to wonder "when is it gonna be over" for some reason I just think it goes on way too long! It's only 3 and a half minutes so I think the only explanation would be that at some point it gets too boring for my taste. Otherwise, it's a fine song.

**ReallyCreative** (7): Fantastic lyrics, but super uninteresting sound-wise

**runaway3212** (7): I want to like this song, but it never really does it for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): im vibin

**untutorable** (7): it's good but idk it's missing something??? mood tho i do hate faking a smile

**1998tweety** (6.5): The intro ain't it, song is kind of cute though.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.5): Manages to be both emotional and generic at the same time

**plantp0wer** (6.3): a bit repetitive

**radiofan15** (6.2): I can appreciate the idea of the song but that shouldn't forgive it from being uneventful and samey

**axestogrind** (6): so does anyone want to talk about how this song sort of sparked the 1920s modern beats blend that has now made Boxout's 'I just want to be the one you love' one of the biggest songs on Tiktok

**FluffyNobody** (6): The bridge has nothing to do with the song??? Why did they put it there? Also I know it's supposed to be empowering, but when she mentions pouting, she sounds like a petulant child

**ggodisawomann** (6): it's okay, I skip this a lot tho. I love the run about "can't somebody walk me to my car..." bc it sounds sooo melodic and good

**pearllouise** (6): Catchy but the beat is basic as fuck

**waluigiest** (6): it’s fine and important but not that interesting

**Kromorei** (5.5): pretty boring but i like it

**twat\_brained** (5): the older I get the more evident it becomes to me that this album is similar to Justin Bieber's Changes in ways which both work to its detriment

**vayyiqra** (5): Yuh. [2]

**skargardin** (4): The sentiment is there i suppose but this is insanely boring

**wavingwolves** (4): paramore outsold sorry ari

**cyborglilith** (3): this sucks

**george\_kaito** (3): the intro is the best part 😍

**selegend** (3): that bridge is the worst thing i’ve heard

**Johnnytoby** (2): yuhck

**lilacsweetener** (2): I like the subject matter, just not the way the song presents.

**vhqv1997** (1): I thought the universe was the most empty thing in existence until I heard this song

I don't do Tiktok so idk *how* wrong you are precisely but if you think the After Laughter sample is 1920s you are at least 40 years wrong

also if 1920s music really is making a comeback sign me tf up for tiktok damn

This was on a Walmart commercial I think? Or a samsung commercial. One or the other. 

Basically what I’m saying is that it really fit the mood of a fancier commercial, and as a result I don’t think it hits the same level of excellence Lizzo has curated for herself and her single discography. I’m really glad it is in the top half of the rate, but it ran its course and this feels right. 

---

**1998tweety** (10): BOP, this is such a big bop she should make it a single again lmao. The chorus fucking slaps and the guitar is amazing.

**agentofscranton** (10): this was my intro to lizzo and it's all cause of a garbage routine on just dance pls don't attack me

**Awkward\_King** (10): its still one of my favorite lizzo songs im in love with it. honestly my eleven would go to this over this if this had a chance in hell of winning

**axestogrind** (10): The absolute POWER this song radiates... the message of self-love and body positivity has literally never been done better

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This is the first song of hers I heard, and honestly? What a high bar she set. Go drink some water!

**cyborglilith** (10): bop

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): KILLER PRE-CHORUS!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): i don’t know if this considered underrated or not, but this song deserved to be a massive hit. It’s one of her best

**JunkyGS** (10): Deserved to be a SMASH!

**Kanne\_** (10): i forgot how much i adore water me

**kappyko** (10): remember when we rated this in a charity rate and it went out day 1.

**letsallpoo** (10): i would like to note that when lizzo was still noname trash and was entered into the 2017 charity rate i was the only one to give her an 11

**leviswift13** (10): THE CHOO CHOO SENT ME, IT DESERVES A TEN ALONE

**ManofOranges** (10): Fucking love this song. I would love to elaborate but I cannot because I don't know how to put it into words. It's also a straight up travesty that this got 42nd in the first charity rate. It deserved so much better.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): ended dehydration

**nick1372** (10): no one ever needs to make a workout song again

**nooodisaster** (10): I love this FKA twigs song

**rhyneston3** (10): My fav of her loose tracks. I wish Phone had also made the album

**runaway3212** (10): Genius song

**skargardin** (10): ironic that the better songs on the album are years old

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): at least this smashed as car commercial background music

**twat\_brained** (10): This is probably not going to win but holy fuck that turn-of-the-decade David Guetta-esque piano riff just SELLS the entire song. Hoping for top 10 at least but expecting #16

**waluigiest** (10): an uptempo smashing serve

**wavingwolves** (10): PRRRRRR PRRRRRRR

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): i discovered this song too late because it’s not on the on the regular album but uhm this is a fucking banger???? wow lizzo really does not miss

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): my plants during quarantine to me, having lost the concept of time

**berober04** (9): Justice for Charity Rate

**ImADudeDuh** (8): when we rated this in the charity rate and this went out on day 1. Lets see if history repeats itself

**Kromorei** (8): oprahgif

**Nickl00** (8): it’s a typical Lizzo bop

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I’m positive this was used in a commercial but I can’t remember what it was for

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): got me like hehe michael jackson lmfao

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): strangest two-rate arc for a song in rate HISTORY periodt (okay blank space is definitely a contender for that)

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): my plants at the office rn

**Mysario** (7.4): I like this song but also don't? it slaps but I can't put my finger on why

**bandnitos** (7): wasn't this in a walmart commercial

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): It's cute and catchy.

**fadedblue09** (7): She does self-loving bops very well. Wish there was less instrumental tbh.

**george\_kaito** (7): forgettable but its still solid

**jayjaysortagay** (7): the generic bop energy is strong with this one

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): not great but I love the energy.

**pearllouise** (7): This song wanted to make it on the album so bad it's like that neighbor kid your mom forces you to hang out with

**Stryxen** (7): yes please take me to church ma’am

**vayyiqra** (7): drink water! but only when you're thirsty don't drink too much you could die from water intoxication it's a real thing and no laughing matter

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.8): not a bad song but any means but it just needs a lil something extra

**radiofan15** (6.7): This does nothing for me... but I can't deny this is at least OK

**FluffyNobody** (6): It's okay, I find the chorus a bit childish but with respect to other songs in this record, it's a lot of improvement

**ladililn** (5.5): This whole metaphor just makes me think of Love Kernels from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and picture Rachel Bloom drinking out of a water bottle like a hamster.

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (4.5): lacks the same oomf factor the rest of the album has

**mayolizard** (4): Sleep Me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this got its popularity out of a target commercial and i think that says more about what type of song this is better than i could ever say

**alwayswords** (3): did she just say “hee hee michael jackson” :skull:

**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): Tone is grating

**akanewasright** (1): I hadn’t heard this song before now. I kind of hate it.

**alwayswords** (10): TRANSITIONS!!

**bandnitos** (10): the vibes are immaculate

**cleen\_claire** (10): flawless

**hadea0090** (10): this would've gotten my 11 but i feel this song is underdone a bit. it just needs an extra oomf

**Kanne\_** (10): almost gave it 100. was i wrong tho?

**mudkip1** (10): this is so cute

**NotWith10000Men** (10): how do they know when to make the production sparse and when not to???

**rhyneston3** (10): I don't even know what to call this, is it a ballad? I love it, it's so beautiful

**runaway3212** (10): Immaculate, it's so fucking amazing

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): Best song on the album. The lyrical flow is great, the atmosphere is haunting, just really works for me

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I love how vibey this is. It’s cute and the production is amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): i actually PLAYED this game when i was younger and it was so obscure and random that I was blown away when I saw this on the tracklist. The song did not dissapoint, it's so nice and comfortable, yet lonely somehow.

**anagalisgv** (9): i love the sinister undertones

**frogaranaman** (9): can we talk about the video game

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): God I love how *creepy* this album sounds in contrast to how sweet the lyrics can be. Also, I like how this song is based off of a video game and then the background music kind of sounds like video game noises without being straight up chip tunes. Another example of a short track that makes its point and gets out.

**Jimmy345960** (9): another great one

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Ooh it’s weird and off-putting I can dig it.

**Nickl00** (9): the melody is absolutely incredible

**Stryxen** (9): sounds like the Don’t Starve OST, which fits the morbid theme I guess (and it slaps)

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i honestly gave this a high of a score cause of the production. i could listen to that instrumental forever, even if billie was reciting the phonebook over it.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Ooof the production goes off here.

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8.5): didn't really vibe with this song on my first listen, but i found myself going back for more again and again

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.3): It's way better than I remebered it, glad I re-listened

**twat\_brained** (8.3): the video game seems so adorable and yet she makes it sound so dark

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): The way elements keep getting added as the song goes... urgh, FINNEAS really popped off here.

**eeveefan01** (8): the production is great here

**jackisboredtoday** (8): wtf this is the most underrated song on the album so please don't rob it here

**jayjaysortagay** (8): the definition of a perfect album track, not much on its own but fits in perfectly

**mayolizard** (8): omg i slept on this

**ReallyCreative** (8): a weird spooky bop

**rsmitty99** (8): So how do we pronounce this? THESE INSTRUMENTATIONS ARE SO WEIRD AND I LOVE IT

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): banger

**vhqv1997** (8): This shit's gonna get played to shit in future edgy horror movies during a scene where a child is being chased in a hallway by a big old man while he's blindfolded and carrying a knife.

**WeastofEden44** (7.9): Very pretty

**agentofscranton** (7.5): this song makes me feel really anxious and uneasy, and i get that that's probably the intention, but i just can't listen to it more than once

**meiscool132** (7.5): I feel like I'm too dumb to understand Billie's songs but I still like them

**wavingwolves** (7.5): when bury a friend transitons into this... so good

**1998tweety** (7): It's kind of a nonevent but tbh being a nonevent is better than being half of this album.

**Anthony-Vince** (7): I like the vibes of this song, but I don't come back to it all that often

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the origin of this song title is p iconic

**leviswift13** (7): some really beautiful lyrics, but still eh.

**ManofOranges** (7): I don't really get the title but the song is cute so I'm not gonna complain. Not a stand out but not a stand in so it like is kind of on the edge of the crowd of sumn I guess?

**skargardin** (7): bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i can’t believe billie is a gamer

**vayyiqra** (7): My family's cat is named Miles and we call him Milo.

**waluigiest** (7): gamer gorl

**wasian-invasion** (7): this whole song feels like a timer ticking down and makes me anxious

**radiofan15** (6.6): Yeah, it's cute... kinda disposable but CUTE nonetheless...

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.4): love the production but the rest falls flat for me

**axestogrind** (6): The production in the -- h- uh- u- u- u- u- r- r- y -- part... chef's kiss... excellence

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (6): This song kind of came and went.

**nooodisaster** (6): It kinda just happens but the production is good.

**hikkaru** (5): gamer girl queen

**Kromorei** (5): not big on it

**pearllouise** (5): cmon tongue twisters

**Mysario** (4.4): did y'all ever play that game? ilomilo? I assume that's what this song is inspired by. this was one of my favourite like 10 years ago on the Xbox 360! the puzzles are great, the aesthetic is cute, and it just was a heckin good time. I can hear how this song is inspired by the game. however, this song never resonated with me as much as it should. I might need to listen to it more but for now, I have to put it low-ish, sorry B!

**bespectacIed** (4): :( i don't feel anything

**ggodisawomann** (4): eh

**kappyko** (4): this one sucks

**george\_kaito** (3): filler

**fadedblue09** (1): At this point I had to consult a lyric site cause I cannot hear whatever the fuck she's saying.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): most heartbreaking song of the year, the transition from the chorus to the second verse leaves me completely gutted every time

**skargardin** (11): This song will probably go out Day 1 but I don't care, this one hits home for me and this score is personal. I've been going through and still am going thru as of the writing of this comment. There are several lines I heavily relate to. First of all the "desperate people find faith.." one. I've been at the point of desperation where I've turned to praying because I just don't know what else to do of the situation. The other line is "I'll just pretend it isn't real". Everything that's happened over the past few months makes me just want to think it's all some kind of big joke, this line hits home. Lastly, "Who am I supposed to talk to, if there's no you?" Taylor sings exactly what's been on my mind these past few months. Is this getting a little too personal? Probably, but this song is so important to me. I've been playing it almost daily as a remedy and hope for brighter days.

**WeastofEden44** (11): I bat for this song so hard, one because it's a stunning song, but it also has a very specific meaning to me. This past October, I found out that my mom has a type of blood cancer that is incurable. She's doing fine and it hasn't progressed as far as I know, but it's been a rollercoaster for me and my family and this song so deeply resonates with me. It's exactly how I have felt for a while now.

**1998tweety** (10): I will not write a long sappy comment to this song cause I don't want a bunch of randos reading and commenting on it anyway, so instead I will call it excellent and slap a 10 on it. On one hand I wish a Taylor x Dixie Chicks collab had more going on, but on the other hand Taylor really needs to sing this song mostly alone. Hopefully we can get another collab on a later album.

**akanewasright** (10): I have never had anyone close to me die, but this song makes me feel like I have. I didn’t fully “get” her love songs until I fell in love myself, but this one clicks for me without having to have that experience.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i love the dixie chicks man

**bbfan132** (10): simple yet beautiful. perfect ballad for this album.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): This reminds me a lot of my late grandfather. No, I'm not crying, you are!!!

**bulforster** (10): I'm not really a fan of Taylor at all and am pretty ambivalent about the rest of this album but you'd have to be heartless not to love this. Featuring the Dixie Chicks is also the most successful political statement on the record.

**CarlieScion** (10): this is just gorgeous. Sad but gorgeous

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): absolutely heartwrenching

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Probably the most emotional song on the album, the first time I heard it I teared up.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): My parents are now both in their 60s. Nothing serious happened to my mother other than she has a heart condition and she is diabetic. Unfortunately, my father had a stroke last year and had to leave the country where my parents are to where I and my sister live now. He is half-paralyzed and has to be in a wheelchair. He couldn't speak properly like he used to. It's honestly conflicting because I had issues with my father and I still clash with him from time to time but somehow, I loved my dad even more now. During this time when my parents are more vulnerable to the severe symptoms of COVID-19, I wish that my parents could be immune and immortal so that I don't have to go through the pain of losing them in the future, especially my mother whom I love so much despite my differences with her. I am so worried about my mother because she is alone in her flat without her husband and her children there and she made the difficult decision to cancel her plans of seeing us in the summer given the current circumstances. I am so glad Taylor decided to put this song on the album. I can’t imagine how difficult it is for her not wanting to hear the song that made her think of her mom's cancer condition. I am also really glad Taylor decided to perform for the "One at Home" concert even though she previously said that she couldn't imagine performing this because it's such a painful song. It's definitely the perfect song we need to hear during these uncertain times. The lyric "This won't go back to normal" definitely hits hard right now. :(

**george\_kaito** (10): a heartbreaking track. my only complaint is that i wish TDC had a stronger prescence, but it makes sense how they arranged the song with the context

**hadea0090** (10): this is really cute :')

**hikkaru** (10): this is hard to listen to but it's so so good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the saddest song ever written (by taylor swift (in 2019))

**JunkyGS** (10): I refuse to listen to this song again, but just know it's still worthy of a 10 because my initial listen of the song still left that much of an impact months later. She really captured all the raw and complicated emotions surrounding this topic and is a worthy gem in Taylor's songwriting crown. <3

**leviswift13** (10): God bless andrea swift.

**moooo566** (10): there may have been some tears

**mudkip1** (10): stream gaslighter

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): i'm already annoyed when this goes out late day one and has a bunch of people slap a bunch of 4's on it and call it boring like it isn't one of the most heartbreaking things ive ever heard

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song is devasting, I love it.

**Nickl00** (10): this is so genuinely sad but I kinda like that about it

**nooodisaster** (10): It feels wrong to give a number to this.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this is poetry

**runaway3212** (10): This song makes me cry so I skip it most of the time, but it's really amazing.

**strangergravityfalls** (10): i like to listen to this when i want to hurt myself

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): idk why im crying in the club rn

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): who gave her the right??? who gave them the right??????

**Austine567** (9.5): I cry everytime

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): i'm not crying you're crying

**rsmitty99** (9.5): This song probably hits harder during these times. I've been fairly lucky when it comes to cancer or anything as devastating. I couldn't fathom seeing a parent suffer through it. Trying to keep telling yourself it'll be fine because that's all you can do to feel you have some power in this. This would be a 10 if she didn't underutilize the Dixie Chicks.

**Anthony-Vince** (9): I don't come back to this track very often because it kind of kills the mood but it really is a beautiful song

**bandnitos** (9): this is my least played song on this album because i need some happy brain juice but fuck its so pretty and sad

**bespectacIed** (9): It's nice that in an album called "Lover" which touches on different facets of pure love --- romantic love, self-love, love for friends --- Taylor found a space for a song about a daughter's love.

**cleen\_claire** (9): This might be her saddest song holy shit

**CritneySpearz** (9): I can’t listen to this song it makes me tear up instantly ughh

**franch** (9): i don't even know how to rate this tbh :'(

**JanuaryFourteenth** (9): This is beautifully sad

**ladililn** (9): The pauses after “I didn’t tell you I was scared”/“you make the best of a bad deal” and then how “that was the first time we were there”/“I just pretend it isn’t real” comes kind of rushing out? Joins “when the sun came up you were looking at me” as my favorite examples of Taylor taking lines that are mundane on paper and turning them into (to borrow a TVTropes term) Wham Lines.

**materialqirl** (9): SOBS

**meiscool132** (9): its only fault is being too sad

**SFbby** (9): Just a tad too sad

**Stryxen** (9): I feel unqualified to give an opinion

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9): The verse melody is beautiful, and the chorus is simple but effective in conveying a feeling of desperation

deleted: **rickikardashian** (8.9): -0.1 because of miwwor

**FluffyNobody** (8.8): It's a lovely song, but the subject is heartbreaking, and for that reason it doesn't have that much replay value. I will happily drown in heartbreak songs, but death is not something you want to hear a whole lot about

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): The lyrics are fantastic but I need more of the Dixie Chicks' vocals.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): i feel like the dixie chicks were a bit underused here but it's still a very very very touching song and taylor's delivery is really great. her desesperation about losing her mother is tangible.

**wardrum5** (8.4): I wish the Dixie Chicks had a larger role

**Mysario** (8.3): should rate this higher but it makes me too sad so I have to skip it every time

**AnimationJava** (8): One of the most raw songs from Lover, whenever I do a full conscious listen of the album I have to choose carefully whether or not to listen to this because sometimes it makes me Too Sad.

**eeveefan01** (8): -Insert Tears-

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This is sweet but just not my cup of tea

**lapascalia** (8): Heartbreaking.

**pearllouise** (8): Taylor killed me, sent me to heaven, and I'm not mad about it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): ballad Taylor > whatever this other stuff is

**waluigiest** (8): this is too sad. also the harmonies and orchestration..... let me listening again....

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.9): Taylor is best at sad songs

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (7.8): this rate is going to make me cry twice with this and Ghostin

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): A beautiful song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Oh this has some country vibes, *Joanne* really changed the game, huh

**patcheso8** (7.5): okay...I stan Taylor. I stan the Chicks. I love that she wrote a song about dealing with her mom's cancer diagnosis, but honestly this is a skip. I just don't love it musically.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Soul-crushing. I doubt I will ever make myself listen to this ever again.

**Jimmy345960** (7): A deep song I don't have a connection to yet. I hope I don't for a long time.

**wasian-invasion** (7): i really hope i don’t have to connect with this song anytime soon

**twat\_brained** (6.6): I can barely hear Natalie! She's too under-utilized here

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Nice on the ears but bland

**jayjaysortagay** (6): no strong opinion beyond nice vocals

**mms82** (6): I get how this song is so personal for her but it's too sad to get repeat listening and it's nothing special for striking that nerve

**shesdoingyoga** (6): This is going to make me sound super bitter and jaded but the fact that the song involves caring about a parent makes me dislike the song because it makes me jealous about her having family she actually likes and who probably accept her unconditionally and the jealousy makes it hard to enjoy haha, at least it sounds pretty

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): Ronan is miles better, but I like the simplicity of the chorus

**avenueroy** (5.4): The Dixie Chicks were wasted

**radiofan15** (5.3): I feel bad for the score I gave this song... but this is just an instant skip for me

**animefangrant62** (5): (I feel bad giving this a 5 considering the subject matter but it's just not my cup of tea.)

**cremeebrulee** (5): nothing against taylor’s mom, but it’s just objectively a boring song.

**cyborglilith** (5): don't care about this

**Kromorei** (5): boring but sad.

**ManofOranges** (5): Yes I know it's the dixie chicks and yes I know it's heartfelt but that doesn't justify making the song so damn boring.

**nick1372** (5): Honestly I can never remember anything about this song after I listen to it

**untutorable** (5): sad and pretty but the dixie chicks are so underused here ugh

**vayyiqra** (5): I don't really like this song but I feel bad giving it a low score knowing it's about her mother having cancer. If I could I would rate it a :pensive: emoji out of 10, but unfortunately I can't, so I'm giving it the most neutral score.

**vhqv1997** (5): Sorry but I ain't feeling anything, she should have kept this as a personal song she sings for her mom, cause I don't feel like I should be listening to this song. And while there's nothing wrong with publicly releasing a song meant for a specific person in hope that it will resonate with others at the same time, it's just not right to put this on an album with a song about cunnilingus right after.

**mayolizard** (4): i like the lyrics ig

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Someone really called this her best ballad I have to laugh. If you’re gonna do a country song, get an actual country producer or BUST. Also the Dixie Chicks were a waste here. At least ME! Was an actual collab.

**rhyneston3** (3): The Dixie Chicks did not sacrifice their career to stop George Bush to end up as backing vocals on the third Taylor Swift ballad in her seventh album

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (3): love to see legends supporting legends but that didn't stop the song from being painfully boring

**AbnormalPopPunk** (2.5): sad but boring

**kappyko** (2): ooh wah

**lilacsweetener** (2): I feel bad rating this low. But such a topic is almost unlistenable unless you’re experiencing it and need to process. Which is obviously why the song exists but it’s a skip for everyone else so we’re not in tears every time. Would’ve preferred it released on its own. Or that she never had to record it at all, of course...

**ggodisawomann** (1): this is so bad I hate it. pointless DC feature

**FluffyNobody** (1): this is tempo all over again

**Johnnytoby** (1): mad she sampled that classic no maam

**ManofOranges** (1): What is going on here? I feel like a song about fitness should be a little less droning or something. Also what's with the toot toots and beep beeps from Bad Girls. I don't see why they are present, they certainly don't elevate the song. If anything, the use of that sample borders on desecration.

**mms82** (1): worst Lizzo song by far

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): this is the first bad Lizzo song I hear

#these two comments were one on top of the other

**TragicKingdom1** (2): i read too many unironic takes that she deserved the guillotine for this

**bespectacIed** (1): Lowlight in Lizzo's career. As a Marxist, I was so sad to find out that we're gonna have to g********** Lizzo in the class war :(

#the one comment that didnt specify if they were against lizzo here

**letsallpoo** (11): iconic

#eat the rich

**puberty1** (10): I wouldn't give this one a 10 alone but remembering her whole thing with the critics after the album was released really got me to that. those days were really bad

**Agusarg** (9): Queen of doxxing

**ImAMessyBitchDuh** (9): she deserves to flop now laideez

**anothertown** (8): Continued to prove that celebrities will side with their own class interests no matter what

**hadea0090** (8): that was shitty of her and unnecessary

**meiscool132** (7.5): and the award for the pettiest feud goes to

**twat\_brained** (7.3): this was just messy more than anything. Not a career-ender or too scandalous really, just petty and ill-judged

**ReallyCreative** (7): A true yikes moment, Stream Juice anyway

**WeastofEden44** (7): This actually really disappointed me ngl

**Tolk1en** (6): idk I didn't hear about that. She went too far here but overall no scandal

**radiofan15** (5): I can forgive her because she became a global star almost overnight... but at the same time, FUCKING YIKES LIZZO!

**runaway3212** (4): this felt really petty

**fadedblue09** (3): Ok, I haven't heard this before, but GURL, this was just mean.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (2): She shouldn't have posted her info in anger. It was wrong. HOWEVER... Y'all seriously haven't worked in a restaurant and dealt with these asshole delivery companies and the shitty drivers and it showed from your comments on that post painting Lizzo out to be hitler or something while that driver was painted as some kind of hindered Saint.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (1): Oh dear, this is definitely the part where I questioned if I should continue stanning Lizzo. I am just hoping she learns her lesson from this because that postmates delivery girl had the right to be upset and file a lawsuit against her.

**jimmy345960** (1): this isnt really a vibe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): Yeah there's really nothing I can do to defend Lizzo for this, what a dick move all around

The song is quite literally dripping in s(a)ex. It’s the most unashamedly mature themed song Taylor has released, and an example of a song that seems to have been written with a picture perfect clear beginning, middle, and end. 

---

**Agusarg** (11): This song is perfection. The sax, the lyrics, it's very different to Taylor's usual style but she pulls it off incredibly well.

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): OKAY i clown this album a lot because it's super bloated and disappointing compared to some of her older works, but this song is just... magnificent. this is like so sublimely horny and so tender and it just makes me feel a lot of things

**lilacsweetener** (11): Definitely one of her strongest experiments. Hanging out for that adult contemporary album I know she has in her. The closest she’s ever come to R&B considering this gives me Miguel and Beyoncé vibes? It’s interesting how this is a step up from the sexier Rep songs in that it details how sexual intimacy is a form of communication. So It Goes was emotionally distant since they were still new, and Dress was a realisation of deeper love via finally making love, but False God is about how sex becomes a key element of a solid relationship just like talking, being together, loyalty, compromise and commitment do. It may not be the full or only answer to repairing a bad fight...but it’s a great way to start.

**Pooter215218** (11): jazz taylor is what the world needs more than ever

**1998tweety** (10): This will be the robbed unfortunately. Tbh this didn't click with me at the very start, but now it's one of my faves from the album. A sexy song from Taylor is not something I was expecting but she does it surprisingly well (I should've known after So It Goes...).

**Anthony-Vince** (10): Jazzy and really different from her other stuff. I actually don't want Taylor to go down this route in the future, because I think it's not really my style, but I really do love this track on its own

**bandnitos** (10): yes ma'am YES MA'AM

**bespectacIed** (10): My favorite song from Lover. I remember spamming this sub about how amazing this is. And it still is. This entire song is a proof of Taylor's songwriting genius in this album when she actually cares enough to show it

**CarlieScion** (10): the power of ‘I’m New York City’….

**dreamingoutloud92** (10): This song was a grower for me but now it’s hands down my favorite from the album.

**fadedblue09** (10): Another 11 contender. It’s definitely what I envisioned a post-Reputation track would be.

**hadea0090** (10): I love this. Stellar production.

**hikkaru** (10): taylor 3 minutes ago: my mother is dying of cancer and so i'm praying to jesus // taylor now: my pussy is an altar and i love getting eaten out

**HolyGroundTS** (10): Fun Fact: I asked Shawn Mendes what his favourite Lover song was in a Q&A and he said this one

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourites from here. I love when Taylor has more mature sounding songs like this and tries something a bit different

**ImADudeDuh** (10): if you would’ve told me I’d be giving a taylor sex jam a 10 like 5 years ago, wild.

**lapascalia** (10): My other favourite song on the album.

**ManofOranges** (10): I've come to love this song. It started off as okay and now it's without a doubt one of my favorites. It's slow but it actually has something to draw you in and keep you there. Also really like the saxophone.

**mms82** (10): ugh that sax

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): That background “eh” honestly ties the whole song together

**patcheso8** (10): I absolutely did NOT like this song when I first heard it. It was a skip for a solid month before I gave it another chance but hooo I'm glad I did because it's amazing.

**puberty1** (10): my most listened song of the album, the fact that the gays that praise run away with me don't see this song being S tier is so disrespectful

**sandyfishnets** (10): the production on this track is amazing. Thank you Jack Antonoff

**SFbby** (10): The final 7 note stretch of the word love is too good

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This deserves a higher placement no matter where it ends up.

**skargardin** (10): a saxophone makes even the shittiest of song an instant ten, thankfully this was already a great song

**Stryxen** (10): why didn’t the album just end here. the lyrics are a beautifully intimate confession and “we might just get away with it” gives off such a good vibe that FEELS like the ending statement. I hope she does more with this wholesomely moody sound in the future

**vhqv1997** (9.5): r/ihavesex

**franch** (9.1): slow burn on this one, i feel i appreciate it more every time i hear it

**cremeebrulee** (9): mmmm that sax. i can’t believe this appeared on the Top 100 Tracks of 2019 finally some taste

**ggodisawomann** (9): yall be hating this but I love it

**J\_Toe** (9): Isn't the West Village in New York City? 👀

**Jimmy345960** (9): Great track, love that sax

**leviswift13** (9): so sensual and intimate. the way she is practically whispering (selena??) is so intoxicating and vivid.

**Nickl00** (9): I didn’t expect a song like this from her but man it’s smooth

**NotWith10000Men** (9): every song in existence could be improved by a saxophone

**runaway3212** (9): This song is a lot subtler than dress, it's also really good.

**strangergravityfalls** (9): some people find it jarring the way taylor swift jumps from thinking about her mother dying from cancer to being horny, but i find it super-duper relatable

**slazenger7** (8.9): Really lush sound; great to see Taylor stretching herself.

**akanewasright** (8.5): This was probably the biggest grower on the album for me. It’s just so smooth.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i'm new york city is a t pose of a lyric

**meiscool132** (8.5): I still don't really get the metaphors but I love it

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): she really snapped and made a song about cunnilingus huh

**wavingwolves** (8.5): i always sing "i'm new york city, bitch, i still do it for you" and while i know the bitch isn't really there i still hear it anyway

**cashewconstellation** (8.4): It was a grower but now I really like it!

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.3): Forget rock, TS8 should be a jazz album

**avenueroy** (8.2): Sax makes everything better, but goddamn, it needs more sax. It needed to end with a Clarence Clemons style sax solo.

**WeastofEden44** (8.2): I hope that Taylor explores more stuff like this

**E3-NotTheConvention** (8.1): I just fucking love sax on pop songs

**Mysario** (8.1): this song feels like it could've been a lot better if it wasn't destined to be a pop song, like that sax is sexy and that vocal thing 3 minutes in is orgasmic hnghhh

**cleen\_claire** (8): The tonal shift from "my mother has cancer" to "I'm a sex goddess gives me fucking whiplash

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): When the Swifties who went to the Lover Secret Sessions said there is a political song in the album, I thought False God would be that song because I thought Taylor would call Trump a False God. Oh man, I was so wrong. It's actually Taylor singing how Joe Alwyn is eating her coochie. I mean, "Religion's in your lips" "Altar is my hips"??????? It's definitely about pussy eating and Taylor definitely invented it.

**eeveefan01** (8): Need more Sax Taylor in my life thanks

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): YES! Taylor should get adventerous with her sound more often!

**FluffyNobody** (8): Sexy Taylor is a mood (one point more for the sax, omg)

**moooo566** (8): taylor is officially horny on main

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8): wow i fuck w this

**ladililn** (7.8): Is Taylor just gonna have one sex-and-religion song on every album now? Because I’m always down for sex-and-religion songs.

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): It's good, but I can't help but think this song could have been something so much more. I don't know exactly what is missing but there was potential here.

**Johnnytoby** (7.5): wait more of this production ms taylor

**mayolizard** (7.5): this is cute

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.5): One of the brightest spots on the album. Love the saxophone and her sultrier delivery. Agree with the criticism I've seen that the song ends awkwardly though.

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): somehow jazz taylor works

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.3): Love the saxophone in this! The production is really pretty if you ignore the weird lyrics.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (7): It's a mood, it sounds nice, the vocals are soothing... I just don't care about what she's singing, is all.

**jayjaysortagay** (7): so many versions of basically this same song but this is the second best one after Lover

**vayyiqra** (7): In a surprising plot twist, Taylor can make neo-soul music and she alludes in the lyrics that she fucks. I am not quite sure what to do with this information but I like the song anyway.

**waluigiest** (7): could be sensual but it’s kind of bland

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (6.8): it's nice to see Taylor experiment a lil

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6.4): It’s an objectively good song, just not to my taste

**pearllouise** (6): The best song to have kinky anal to in a church bathroom without being judged

**TiltControls** (6): I think this one actually needed to lead to some sort of payoff

**twat\_brained** (6): I keep listening to this and just getting hooked on the "blind faith" lyric but not much else

**anothertown** (5): generic

**bulforster** (5): I normally love a saxophone but I really don't like hearing what sounds like its mechanisms. I think it's an intentional percussive element but it's just distracting me.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): Taylor Swift comparing her hips to an altar made me an atheist.

**nooodisaster** (5): It's a vibe it's just.. not my vibe. Like there's no replay value for me, and the whole point of it being sexy... it's not sexy.

**radiofan15** (5): I didn't like it yet I didn't hated it, I just didn't cared... so I'm just gonna move on

**rhyneston3** (5): Wow this album is starting to drag

**rsmitty99** (5): It kind of bores me? It reminds me of This Love, in terms of production. But This Love is eons better. I don't feel like the saxophone riffs fit too well.

**untutorable** (4.5): i'm sorry i'm bored... the horns are nice though

**kappyko** (4): church sex metaphors are so passe.

**Kromorei** (4): to be honest i don't even remember what this song sounds like and that should tell you something.

**AnimationJava** (3): I find False God pretty boring tbh, I think Dress was a much better attempt at a sexual song from her.

**george\_kaito** (3): boring, next

**goldentayslight** (3): skip sorry taylor

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): what kind of cheap saxophone bullshit is this

**Brendon-Urine** (2.5): Clunky is the best word for this song, just not fitting for Taylor

**alwayswords** (0): the synth in this sounds like a crying baby

I **really** disliked this song when I first listened to thank u, next. I relistened 3 times before this rate, and this is now one of my favs of the album, and one of my favorites of 2019 in retrospect. 

It’s vulnerable, cute, self-aware, and also unapologetic. It gives Ariana a lot more depth as a character ^(if we’re studying the album as if it was a story) and adds to the main theme *thank u, next* touches, that she’s a very complex person with many internal issues that end up reflecting in her relationships, yet it also showcases that she isn’t necessarily a bad person. It’s critical of her *and* it empathises with her struggles. Like several of the songs around it, it is a victim of the ballad curse, with it falling just a hair too soon compared to other Ariana songs left. 

---

**AnimationJava** (11): A criminally underrated Ariana ballad. It's probably the most relatable song I've heard in her discography and it only aged like a fine wine. I think everybody knows how it feels to be needy and want to be wanted, and that's why it resonates so well.

**alwayswords** (10): the vulnerability of this song chefskiss

**anothertown** (10): wig flew everytime I listen to this, it’s so pretty and ~haunting~

**bandnitos** (10): i too can be needy

**CarlieScion** (10): gorg

**cashewconstellation** (10): I adore it.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This song invented the pleading face emoji and we all should be grateful for that.

**Evanbrooks324** (10): love this song, one of my favs off this album

**ggodisawomann** (10): MMMM needy gets some hate but it's so gorgeous to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Songs like this are exactly why so many young gay men have latched on to Ariana, I *knew* we were right to trust her.

**hadea0090** (10): I relate. the production is quite minimalist but it stays interesting as it's melancholy but upbeat at the same time.

**lapascalia** (10): I love the harmonies and the lyrics. It’s great when Ariana gets personal in her songs.

**leviswift13** (10): literally one of her best songs. i relate on a SPIRITUAL level.

**ManofOranges** (10): I love this song and that's really all I have to say!

**mayolizard** (10): ok mood

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Goddamn, someone come give this woman a hug.

**nick1372** (10): ....tell me how good it feels to be needed....

**puberty1** (10): my favorite song in the album by far. idk why but every time i listen to this song i hear Self Control by Frank Ocean and ive never found a mashup of the two songs so if someone wants to do it i'm all for it (just start with the "i, i, i know you gotta leave, leave, leave" when needy is almost ending)

**Mysario** (9.6): a vulnerable yet solemn self-reflecting tune

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): when i first listened to this song i was having a really bad day mentally and this track really just hit, I ended up putting it on loop and lightly crying standing in the middle of a packed peak hour train ride home.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (9.2): this song should be the official theme song for every Cancer sign

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.1): Such a simple but melancholic song, and maybe this rate is way higher than it should but I just fckin relate to this so much.

**akanewasright** (9): I feel so basic for liking this song so much. I should honestly dislike this song if only for that “after all this damage I can’t help it” line. But it just... hits home, okay. Ari is kind of the queen of unstable Fe and I relate.

**Anthony-Vince** (9): Beautiful!

**bulforster** (9): I hummed this so often when it came out that my aunt's parrot learned how to whistle it.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Haunting, really.

**overscore\_** (9): I always misheard the line "I'm obsessive and I love too hard/Good at overthinking with my heart" as "I'm obsessive and I love to hunt/Good at overthinking with my [rhyme]"

**runaway3212** (9): It's great

**avenueroy** (8.5): The last 30 seconds outsold

**mms82** (8.5): loved this song when it came out but aged poorer than I wouldve thought

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): I really like this song, just wish it was not as one note throughout. Like it had potential to be even better.

**WeastofEden44** (8.1): It's a great song but the constant out-of-tune ringing is like auditory herpes.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): Another beautiful song. And so relatable.

**bespectacIed** (8): queen of needing

**eeveefan01** (8): a bop

**jayjaysortagay** (8): I love this, its only lower than others because its sort of like the B-version of goodnight n go which I think is a classic

**Johnnytoby** (8): it's cute but nothn special

**rsmitty99** (8): The hip hop flow in her delivery somehow works for me. I think I wouldn't like this song if it came out of someone like Lil Uzi, Drake, or other Singer/Rappers. Weird comparison, sure. But this son fits that vibe.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): It feels like it’s missing something in the production, almost like it needs more going on with bass

**twat\_brained** (8): Good but i set my expectations too high since this is only two letters away from Greedy

**untutorable** (8): relatable

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): I actually feel like this would be an excellent closing track, and its placement early in the album doesn't make too much sense to me. It's good though.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I love the lyrics to this but the production needs a little bit more something for me

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): i think it is a great song but not one of my favorites in the album

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): the contrast with this leading into nasa is #relatable

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (7.5): my bf's anthem

**anagalisgv** (7): the strings are fantaaastic

**cleen\_claire** (7): like a warm blanket on a cold day

**Nickl00** (7): wish it was longer but still a highlight

**rhyneston3** (7): A little short, still fun though. Never really goes anywhere

**skargardin** (7): boppy

**meiscool132** (6.5): I wanted to like it more but the beeping(?) throws me off

**radiofan15** (6.5): A cute song but I got a headache by the halfway point... thank God for the string sections!

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): actually really enjoy the lyrics but the production is so... stagnant until almost the end but by then I'm already annoyed

**1998tweety** (6): Meh, I heart a slowed down sad version of this and it was SO much better. This just doesn't do anything for me.

**Kanne\_** (6): im being dramatic here but i really dont feel strongly about needy

**nooodisaster** (6): The one song on the album I just never clicked with. Lyrically yes it's saying sumthin, but I'm ready to move on.

**waluigiest** (6): a well written song hurt by the grating ostinato in the background

**wavingwolves** (6): i think i have a hard time connecting with ariana's songs because usually i feel exactly the opposite of how she feels, which makes sense if you consider she's a cancer and i'm a capricorn

**FluffyNobody** (5.5): I find the beat sooo grating

**slazenger7** (5.5): Boring.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Kelsea Ballerini outpeaked

**JanuaryFourteenth** (5): This production sucked until the strings kicked in and that’s what they should’ve done the whole time what the fuck was with the car alarm shit

deleted: **george\_kaito** (4): skip this song, im bored

**kappyko** (4): i get it but it's simply not my thing

**vayyiqra** (4): I like the chill lo-fi vibe, then after that the lyrics are a real turnoff since I can't stand needy people, and yes maybe that's not very rational since it's not like I know Ariana in real life, but also an anxious-insecure attachment style can be a respond to trauma, and oh the song is over nvm.

**vhqv1997** (4): There's nobody who could make a bland song as resonant as Ariana, but at the same time it's still a bland song.

**pearllouise** (3): Overrated as fuck next

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): The melody is too flat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): i wish i could sing lazily over one piano cord for slightly over 2 minutes and get millions of streams for it :(

**Kromorei** (2): this is one of her worst songs and absolutely the most overhyped. pure garbage.

**lilacsweetener** (2): I dislike the hypnotic beat and I can’t really relate to what she’s saying at all.

**RosaPalms** (2): how does anyone listen to this song? do those chimes not tear your eardrums apart?

**fadedblue09** (1): NOPE. I’m sorry Arianators, I don’t get the love for this. It’s too monotonous, boring and the sentiment is executed better elsewhere in the album. Would’ve been fine as an interlude like Make Up, but sadly it overstayed its welcome.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): this production gives me headaches. if that noise didn't go nonstop for almost the ENTIRE song maybe it would be tolerable.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I have such a personal attachment to this song because my university doesn't really give a fuck about its students and this is the song I keep listening to when they release another tone-deaf statement. Their actions mirrored my own country's political climate right now. Taylor Swift really meant it when she said: "ONLY THE YOUNG CAN RUN".

**ManofOranges** (10): I mean, this is certainly the best of Taylor's bonus songs. It's nice that it's short, if it went on longer I think it would end up overstaying its welcome. The final chorus is very nice.

**Tolk1en** (10): the chorus, with the deep voice and instrumentals make me travel far, very far, even though I've nearly not left my house for 2 months

**materialqirl** (9.5): OMG FIRST LISTEN AAAAAAA

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Quite enjoyable.

**pearllouise** (9): Once again, vote.gov

**runaway3212** (9): The good version of Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince.

**bandnitos** (8): it's a cute bop

**eeveefan01** (8): It's a nice song

**fadedblue09** (8): It's just watered down Miss Americana. Still better than half the album tho.

**Mysario** (7.9): the longest 2.5 minutes of my life

**patcheso8** (7.5): not a huge fan

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.1): Didn't love it

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Taylor says you American kiddos need to go and vote!! Listen to her!!

**PointlessBibliophage** (7): i like the message but the production choices aren't my favorite

**shesdoingyoga** (7): The message is nice but it’s almost too direct if that makes sense

**vayyiqra** (7): finally some good fucking food

**WeastofEden44** (7): This song is fine

**dreamingoutloud92** (6.5): Can we not have children sing in any more songs please?

**puberty1** (6.5): if someone told me this song was for a WHO campaign to help children in some way I would've easily believe it. great pre-chorus tho

**1998tweety** (6): Meh.

**AnimationJava** (6): Ok while this song does sound like it was generated by an AI, I find that it scratches an ear worm of some kind.

**avenueroy** (6): A CHILDREN'S CHOIR???

**bespectacIed** (6): who's diane and why is the only one who could run

**FluffyNobody** (6): I understand why it didn't make the cut for Lover - Miss Americana is developing the concept with more nuance and is the better song of the two

**hadea0090** (6): how many soundtrack songs has she made ejfebfbj

**jayjaysortagay** (6): nice message, mediocre song

**ladililn** (6): Change had a glo-up, if you can use glo-up to mean going from bleh to meh.

**leviswift13** (6): the second verse sad tho

**slazenger7** (5.8): Taylor's worst song of the era (yes, worse than ME!). I understand why it was only released as a movie tie-in.

**radiofan15** (5.2): Very obviously an outtake... and the kids ruin it as usual

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.1): Lyrics are too heavy-handed, and the choir makes me cringe

**axestogrind** (5): Does Taylor know that when people asked her to talk about politics they meant 'denounce white supremacists championing you'... instead of 'we need semi-political songs full of underwritten and meaningless platitudes'?

**bbfan132** (5): kind of basic for a song that is trying to encourage younger people to be politically active…

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (5): It means well but Taylor girl, could you maybe step back up your lyrical game? Only the young.... can RUN? What? Are we forgetting you have to be 35 years old at least to run for President? Stop insulting Daddy Sanders1

**cleen\_claire** (5): "Only the young can run." Actually mostly old people run for president Taylor.

**jackisboredtoday** (5): this is just so flavorless and boring, and all its vague political insights are so meh. this should’ve stayed in the vault

**Kromorei** (5): does anyone remember this

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): I don’t get it, I’m sorry.

**ggodisawomann** (4): I also did not like this. it's not bad but again, just not my taste

**mayolizard** (4): i hate the verse about the school shooting because my school was actually shot up so when i listen to a fucking taylor swift song i don't want to hear about that shit.

**ReallyCreative** (4): the way she set me up for disappointment with that chorus wow go girl give us nothing

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4): It’s catchy but a little childish

**Agusarg** (3): Really hate this song. Her "political" track plays it safe as one would expect. That chorus is so bland too, she has done much better than this

**Awkward\_King** (3): its a song

**ComeOnPupperfish** (3): Is this a Zedd remix?

**letsallpoo** (3): why does this sound like beautiful people

**nick1372** (3): I've never said this about Taylor but this one feels like she didn't even try.

**skargardin** (3): maybe the most forgettable song in taylor's entire discography

**vhqv1997** (3): This song doesn't have a chorus as far as I'm concerned.

**waluigiest** (3): I appreciate what she was trying to do but there was a reason this didn’t make it onto Lover. The ideas are half formed and the melodies are recycled. Seriously compare “you were outnumbered” to “waving homecoming queens” in Miss Americana.... like what??

**CarlieScion** (2): no.

**cremeebrulee** (2): annoying and super simplistic. yes trump is bad but let’s not pretend that he’s the only thing wrong with the US rn lol. i understand that that a song isn’t the place to put the most nuanced political take but in that case she would’ve been better off not releasing it.

**hunnybee12** (2): this is taylor’s fight song,

**Tedyonce** (2): god this song is boring

**rickikardashian** (1.5): if this is what some people thought Out Of The Woods sounded like, I completely understand why they hated it so much

**Nickl00** (1): those kid vocals or whatever idek what that was

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this isn’t even that painful to listen to but it gets a 1 solely on being taylor most generic least interesting song by a LANDSLIDE

**wavingwolves** (1): no thoughts head empty

[Anytime Billie and Finneas sing this song together](https://i.imgur.com/awvCPAe.jpg)

Gorgeous, and probably her most robbed song. Another victim of the ballad curse in /r/popheads hates. It’s crazy the amount of talent Billie has for her age and her ability to craft beauty from such simple concepts. 

---

**Brendon-Urine** (11): Easy 11. This is by far the best song in the rate, and not just one of the best songs by a pop artist in 2019 but one of the best songs of the year period. The "oos" in the outro are so simple but give me chills.

**hadea0090** (11): I've never fallen in love but this song makes me feel like i just did and it hurts

**NotWith10000Men** (11): I love the gentle building up to the 'I love you' part ughhh so beautiful

**agentofscranton** (10): life is strange soundtrack teas

**akanewasright** (10): Following up listen before I go with the happiest (?) song on the album was a good choice. It’s just so damn lovely.

**anagalisgv** (10): the SNL performance .... cries

**bandnitos** (10): i haven't cried in a month and this broke my streak

**fadedblue09** (10): Oh wow, she won here tbh. The relative simplicity of the song allows for all of its elements to shine. Probably gonna get robbed early, but I don't care.

**george\_kaito** (10): so pretty, the slowed down + reverb version slaps too

**jayjaysortagay** (10): totally perfect, so emotional

**leviswift13** (10): her best song. easily.

**meiscool132** (10): crying to this is an experience. also, when I first listened I knew I recognised the melody in the chorus and I went crazy until I realised it's similar to hallelujah

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): Don't say you love me, you don't even know me, if you really want me, then give me some time. Don't go there baby, not before I'm ready. Don't say your heart's in a hurry, it's not like we're gonna get married. Give me, give me, some time.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This girl is just so talented I’ll never get over it.

**pearllouise** (10): I love you too Billie. This song is the equivalent of a warm hug.

**runaway3212** (10): Best song on the album

**Stryxen** (10): the build up?? the lyrics??? the EMOTION?!?! unmatched

**Tedyonce** (10): this song is lush and gentle and broken...its the sonic equivalent of a lake at night

**twat\_brained** (10): I wish my connection with my sisters was as meaningful and impactful as Billie and Finneas so I wouldn't have to weep when I don't get on well with them.

**valus** (10): billie said "imma MAKE them lonely guys cry"

**waluigiest** (10): you strip back the edgy images and maximalist beats and you still have a powerful and beautiful song. Billie is a huge talent

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): soothing and beautiful

**E3-NotTheConvention** (9.1): Damn these rates made me realize how much I love sad songs.

**cleen\_claire** (9): that hallelujah interpolation is TOO DAMN GOOD

**Evanbrooks324** (9): hallelujah

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Billie’s voice sounds good over acoustic guitar and this song is a good showcase of that

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): real shit 💯

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): This reminds me of Taylor Swift's This Love for some reason and I mean it as a compliment

**wavingwolves** (9): the way the chorus builds is so! good!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): ok this sounds really nice but i think its a little weird and creepy how her brother sings along with her on this?? it makes it sound really incesty and ruins an otherwise beautiful song

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): probably the best of the ballads on this album, giving me Lorde vibes. I need a fuller production or sound with bigger body but it still very beautiful

**alwayswords** (8): whenever i listen to this song i think about the comment on popheads that insisted that this was some incest love song i cant

**AnimationJava** (8): The strings in this song are so serendipitous, one of her better ballads.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (8): This song is really pretty.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): 'Love is the scariest feeling in the world', she put as the storyline to this video, and that feeling does come across in the last verse. Chills.

**kappyko** (8): yes

**nooodisaster** (8): At her best, Billie's voice has a haunting quality and you know what I'll call this song that. The lyrics are actually good, and the production is creative.

**skargardin** (8): cute

**Tolk1en** (8): The background sounds during the last chorus remind me of Interstellar and I won't complain about it

**wasian-invasion** (8): never really paid attention to this one except for the hallelujah melody, but it's actually way better than I thought

**WeastofEden44** (8): It's a great song but the fact that she sings this with her brother is a bit unsettling lol

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8): where was this when I was in hs

**1998tweety** (7.5): Nonevent, but it's slightly better than the previous song.

**mayolizard** (7.5): this makes me sleepy

**Mysario** (7.1): it's a very sincere and beautiful song much more than it should be

**Johnnytoby** (7): this legend of zelda erasure

**Nickl00** (7): love the hallelujah sample

**radiofan15** (6.8): is this song about xxxtentacion?. also, it just kept going and going and going and going and...

**FluffyNobody** (6): Again, this is a bit too sad for my taste, although I love the chorus

**mms82** (6): i mean her performances of this song with Finneas were weird to others too right

**rhyneston3** (6): Album is still dragging. If this and listen before I go had been cut, this album would be a certified classic

**vayyiqra** (6): :pensive: This is far too slow and minimal for Popheads to like it but it has an understated charm.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.7): A beautiful song, but ultimately kind of limp. Same problem as The Archer but not as bad

**Kromorei** (5.5): decent

**CarlieScion** (5): v boring

**ggodisawomann** (5): this whole album is so underwhelmingggggggg

**ManofOranges** (5): This is yet another cut that I simply do not remember like at all. I'm honestly surprised that I'm not rating this song lower given how it didn't leave a mark in my mind at all but I don't have the time to go back and listen so I could think of a new score so here we are.

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (5): the first half of this album i really enjoyed and now its just fallen flat -_-

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): diminishing returns on these ballads

**bespectacIed** (4): ...

**axestogrind** (3): dead rose emoji Twitter ruined this but also it's just not very interesting as a song

**Ghost-Quartet** (2.5): I’m sorry but that performance of Billie and her brother performing this on SNL is creepy in the wrong way. The song is really boring too.

**puberty1** (2): why is this 5 minutes long

**vhqv1997** (2): This is some grade-A snoozefest

people were just mad because she isn’t skinny, let’s be real

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic. Was only an issue 'cause she doesn't fit the typical male gaze

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): jang a lang

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): People need to get over themselves. #LetLizzoTwerkWheneverSheWants

**radiofan15** (10): Oh my gosh, look at her butt // Yeah, he love this fat ass, hAhAhAhAhAhAhAhAhA!!!!

**RosaPalms** (10): did y'all notice that 2020 was going alright until that moment?

**tedyonce** (10): head bitch moves

**wavingwolves** (10): she should show her ass whanever she wants idc

**vhqv1997** (9): Again, wtf Lizzo

**twat\_brained** (8.6): …it's not unwarranted. The outfit she wore is meant for Coachella; she was inside the Staples Center with network broadcasters showing the game. I wouldn't see the Raptors with my backside cut out from my jeans displaying my boxers. **(ricki note: coward)**

**leviswift13** (8): only rating this high bc it was funny that this even was an issue. y'all really hate to see a plus-size woman confident in her skin, huh?

**anothertown** (6): She looked really cute with that ponytail

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): distasteful for sure, but im sure hundreds of other girls have done similar things before and no one cares but because lizzo is fat she's the one who suddenly gets negative attention?? just say you hate fat people already

**puberty1** (5): i feel like this could've been an interesting conversation but people just dismissed as "she's disrespectful think of the children"

**fadedblue09** (4): I applaud her confidence, but there's a time and place for exhibitionism.

**hadea0090** (3): meanwhile cheerleaders wearing mini skirts is totally fine and acceptable 🤪🤪🤪

**WeastofEden44** (3): If she was thinking no one would give a shit

**1998tweety** (2): come on....Lizzo you should know better

**ReallyCreative** (2): I hate the fact that this was a controversy, I hate how selectively prude our society is or that somehow a big girl twerking is more harmful than the fetishization of violence rampant in our media but I digress!

**TragicKingdom1** (1): this one just makes me sad tbh bc it really should not have been controversial

#not controversial didnt care
**jimmy345960** (10): this shouldnt be a controversy and stream juice

**lilacsweetener** (5): yeah I guess so though I had no idea this even happened...

**Tolk1en** (4): not a controversy

I’ve discussed this in depth a couple of days ago on Discord, and I think it is fitting to bring it up now: 

Lover is largely a bloated era. Everything seems just a bit too extra, the flowers, the pastels, the songs, and the themes are all just a bit too on the nose for it to flow as one would expect from Taylor. DBATC avoids that by and large for me, and I think it is because of just how little it borrows from Taylor’s life. She isn’t trying to relate this to her perfect boyfriend, or how she is a new found gay ally. It’s something she found inspiration for from a movie, and it lead to her most naturally flowing song from this record. 

---

**CarlieScion** (11): the fact that the best song on this mfing album wasn’t even inspired by her own life

**TiltControls** (11): The lyrics in this song are just perfect. "I dress to kill my time. I take the long way home. I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright, they say, "I don't know"" is the perfect encapsulation of wandering the streets at night thinking about where your life is going. There are so many great songs in this rate, but this was always going to get my 11.

**1998tweety** (10): Good LORDE that bridge, this song is a 10 for that alone. Thankfully, the rest of the track delivers too. We get a bit of a weirder chorus from Taylor which is always appreciated (and before someone comments saying "omg of course Taylor stans are calling this weird, can they please listen to something else besides basic pop?" Reading comprehension is important, this is weird for HER standards.)

**agentofscranton** (10): taylor and amazing bridges, name a more iconic duo

**Anthony-Vince** (10): One of her most unique songs. It's catchy, I love the production, and the bridge is one of her best ever

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): Just a masterpiece. Almost got my 11.

**bespectacIed** (10): "I look through the windows of this love even though we boarded them up // Chandelier still flickering here cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not" proof of Taylor's songwriting genius in this album when she actually cares enough to show it

**cashewconstellation** (10): Amazing!

**cyborglilith** (10): amazing production

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): It took a while for Death By A Thousand Cuts to grow on me. I went from slightly liking it to loving it. Every time I listen to this song, I think of the scenes from movies where the characters I liked are going through a terrible time. Their agony is so painful that it literally feels like death by a thousand cuts. I think about Lady Bird, BoJack Horseman etc. when I listen to this song. The lyrics here showcase how much of a brilliant songwriter Taylor is because she was at her romance high during the recording of the album and she can still write a great break-up song.

**FluffyNobody** (10): This is track listing done right: you're already destroyed by the hypothetical heartbreak in Cornelia Street, and then she goes and completely annihilates you with the actual break up. Also, this song just improves at every listen.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended chinese water torture

**leviswift13** (10): lyrical masterpiece. the second verse/bridge/perfection is a HUGE discography highlight. "i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright, they say 'i don't know.'"

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): the production on this is so fucking weird and majestic at the same time, and it's surprisingly catchy

**mudkip1** (10): BOP i hated this at first but now i love her

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I love the stoplight callback to cornelia street

**patcheso8** (10): this was a contender for my 11. I think the writing on this is incredible. I didn't like the movie this was based on though, I think "Someone Great" was boring.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): that bridge is the biggest grower in her entire discography

**SFbby** (10): Bridge City

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (10): the way she sings "you're not my baby" ugh, emoting Taylor is my favourite Taylor. also the "i ask the traffic lights line," and second verse, amazing.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the best song of the album by a fucking mile and a top 5 taylor song. the bridge in this goes HARD AS FUCK and i love that we can even hear her breaths. it's taylor at her best

**Mysario** (9.8): instrumentally it's so hectic but I think that's what makes it so amazing

**LeninaCrowne94** (9.6): One of her best bridges, and I love the production

**dreamingoutloud92** (9.5): Hello bridge city.

**meiscool132** (9.5): the guitar, the 'my my my', the piano, how I'll forever associate it to Someone Great thus elevating the song and the movie, arghh I just can't

**franch** (9): probably overshadowed by the four that precede it, because it's pretty damn good.

**george\_kaito** (9): a banger, the lyrics are some of the most well-written of lover imo

**ggodisawomann** (9): huge bop

**nooodisaster** (9): Taylor Swift can take a shitty Netflix movie and write a better song than 99% of your favs, when will they ever. The bridge alone... wow.

**rsmitty99** (9): The instrumental build at the beginning really catches me. I think that's best part of this song.

**skargardin** (9): finding nemo really did pave the way

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (9): the last 30 seconds are pure bliss

**anothertown** (8.5): Okay now this! This! There is something so early 2000s about this song, I love the guitar (super 2003 pop/r&b midtempo girl) and the arpeggiated(?) piano. The way the song builds to the piano and ebbs back down to the guitar.

**puberty1** (8.5): probably the song that most grew on me in the album, the post-chorus is so so good

**twat\_brained** (8.5): this starts out like that Mario startup sound when you're about to enter a world on Super Mario 64, before delving into a fun synth tune. This is what I never knew I wanted from Taylor

**Awkward\_King** (8): holy fuck this is a bop this song is literally clicking for me right now wow

**cleen\_claire** (8): I want to vibe yet I must cry

**Kromorei** (8): it's honestly pretty good and i own a shirt for this song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): That traffic light lyric is honestly one of the best in her career.

**nick1372** (8): MY MY MY MY MY MY MY MY

**Nickl00** (8): some of the best lyrics on the album

**rhyneston3** (8): Taylor's voice sounds really nice in here

**runaway3212** (8): A great track

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): I wish this song was as edgy as the title suggested

**wasian-invasion** (8): is this technically a fanfic?

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.8): GREAT lyrics, but the melody is just okay

**WeastofEden44** (7.8): I don't quite see what y'all do in this song but the bridge is fantastic

**AnimationJava** (7.5): :chefskiss:

**eeveefan01** (7.5): Fury Swipes wishes

**plantp0wer** (7.5): don’t love the intro but the rest of the song makes up for it

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): There’s something about the bridge that I don’t like but I like the rest

**akanewasright** (7.2): This song has grown on me a LOT, but the production hinders my experience of it. The song is much better acoustic. The lyrics are gorgeous though.

**anagalisgv** (7): love the piano

**jayjaysortagay** (7): moi moi moi moi moi moi moi moi

**Jimmy345960** (7): This is fine when i am in the mood.

**ReallyCreative** (7): Another song that doesn't have the same appeal that it did when the album dropped, it's fine though

**untutorable** (7): i didn't like this one upon release but i think i just didn't like it right after cornelia street,,, she's not bad but her place in the tracklist is weird

**waluigiest** (7): “yeah jack just go fucking nuts on the piano”

deleted: **radiofan15** (6.8): The piano in the chorus outsold the entire song

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I don’t know why Taylor sees the need to cram so many different metaphors into the same song, these lyrics are so confused. Is the love a book, a house, death by a thousand cuts, a haunted club, a country… girl pick three and stop. It does sound like she’s maybe gonna start singing “My Neck, My Back” during the bridge, so that’s pretty funny. The sonics are pleasant though, she sounds good here.

**ladywolvs** (6.5): but begrudgingly bc she plagiarised from queen allie x

**Stryxen** (6.5): ma’am this is one track before London boy

**avenueroy** (6.4): I love the piano runs (?) in the background, but they don't seem to mesh well with the rest of the song at all

**bandnitos** (6): a good song but NO she had to add the fucking pianos

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Cute filler. The bridge is killer, as it usually is with Taylor, but the song is insignifcant otherwise.

**hadea0090** (6): ok

**pearllouise** (6): There could 1000 cuts in one death and 999 don't believe in you...

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5.5): album filler

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): The church-ey adlibs say 'five' and I agree!

**cremeebrulee** (5): i have this song cut from my lover playlist so relistening to it just confirms that it’s still super annoying to me

**ignitethephoenix** (5): the beginning of this song reminds me of the seagulls in Finding Nemo.

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is yet another filler bitch. So many of these songs like they're just taking up time. Like just get on with it already. And it doesn't help that this album is so long, longer than any other Taylor album. It really is death by a thousand deep cuts.

**vayyiqra** (5): A very mid song.

**alwayswords** (4): the breakup songs on lover are so bad it makes me want to stream red or speak now... a clever marketing tactic i think

**HolyGroundTS** (4): I read that this song was inspired by that not-so-great Netflix movie and it made me like it even less

**kappyko** (4): this is literally cruel summer

**mayolizard** (4): again this is boring

**vhqv1997** (4): This song has something I really hate about most of the music production these days: turning an infinitely annoying vocal sound effect into a repetitive pattern to hide the bare-bones instrumental. No offense but this song would have sounded far better with normal instruments (imagine a poprock remix with electric guitar) instead of synths.

**hikkaru** (3): some of taylor's weakest melodies and that piano is so grating, not to mention that this song isn't even personal she said it was inspired by a movie, i can't

**Johnnytoby** (2): ya know pretty noises doesnt mean it's a good song fellow listeners

**lilacsweetener** (2): The production makes me uncomfortable and that terrible movie didn’t deserve Taylor’s time. I like the crazed piano and I like “Why am I still writing pages?” but I don’t look forward to much else.

**fadedblue09** (1): How many zeros am I allowed to give? I will never understand what Swifties see in this migraine-inducing trainwreck.

In retrospect, I think I really underrated this. I’m reading through the lyrics, and her lyricism is staunchly on brand, and it is doing everything The Man wanted to do but without taking itself too seriously. Lizzo isn’t branding this as the new feminist anthem, she’s speaking her mind, and she’s not taking shit for it. There’s a small set of lines that really work for me: 

Sugar, spice and I'm nice
Show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool baby
With or without makeup

The flow, the TLC reference, the implementation of classic classifications of girls (sugar spice and everything nice). It’s lyrically one of her best. 

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Random fact but I saw the movie *Little (2019)* (which was fun and under appreciated, Regina Hall is a treasure) and it came out a week before this album did but this song was in it (albeit briefly and in the background) and me and my friend freaked out in cinema. Anyways, I considered giving a lot of songs my 11 but when I thought about which song in the rate I know every word to, which song always gives me energy and makes me happy, which song makes me go APESHIT, I knew it had to be this one. This song is so good even Lizzo doesn’t want it to end! Pop perfection and I’ve paid snipers to fire on any sludge drinkers who refuse to acknowledge this landmark moment so we’ll see who’s standing at the end of day three…

**akanewasright** (10): A lot of the lyrics are pretty standard issue girl power, but it’s so much FUN.

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (10): Fucking love this song. A total jam. Makes me wish I was a girl.

**bespectacIed** (10): MY TRUE 11. One of my most listened songs of 2019. It's just a fucking fun song, the verses are hilarious without being patronizing, the chorus is gigantic and anthemic, everything about this song is a JOY. I love this unabashed celebration of femininity.

**bulforster** (10): Lizzo said trans rights!!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Her wordplay in this is very underrated, in my opinion.

**cremeebrulee** (10): literally invented feminism. i don’t even know what else to say but this song makes me wanna fight every dude that’s done me dirty.

**ggodisawomann** (10): RUN IT LIKE A GIRL

**hikkaru** (10): sorry not sorry is shaking

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why tf was this not the next single after good as hell.

**Kanne\_** (10): idc i love this fucking song

**kappyko** (10): you cant be mad at this being "sorry not sorry" bc its literally the same producers

**ManofOranges** (10): It's enjoyable! I think it's catchy enough and endearing for me to really like it, and that's in spite of the fact that I think at times it can sound a little grating. It's not as bad as some other songs on this album though so I'm gonna let this song get away with it.

**meiscool132** (10): girl powerrrr! and that bridge is beautiful

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): a true Powerpuff Girl

**pearllouise** (10): BOP That's B-O-P for ya nerve. Holy shit this is so fucking catchy. Give me everything hunty.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Trans Rights!

**wardrum5** (10): she really creates thirty instagram captions per song

**cleen\_claire** (9): Women truly are better

**dreamingoutloud92** (9): Bad bitch Lizzo what’s up?

**Jimmy345960** (9): I was gonna something about feeling like a woman but i decided that I wanted to say trans rights are human rights

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This needs a Megan Thee Stallion remix.

**rickikardashian** (9): girl/world rhyme, take a shot

**rsmitty99** (9): That chorus is sooooo much fun

**WeastofEden44** (9): Feminist jam, outsold Betty Friedan

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Hype woman realness! Love this from her

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): lizzy o said trans rites

**franch** (8.5): ok this kinda slaps

**Stryxen** (8.5): exciting :) a bop :)

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): this slaps but her saying like a girl kills the vibe a bit by making it less subtle

**AnimationJava** (8): One of the better b-sides, this album showcases Lizzo's strong and empowering feminist message.

**bandnitos** (8): why wasn't this a single

**CarlieScion** (8): bop

**frogaranaman** (8): I shotgunned a White Claw when she performed this song live

**JanuaryFourteenth** (8): God is a woman

**jayjaysortagay** (8): this is fun but it feels more like a label-mandated track than something that came from Lizzo's heart

**leviswift13** (8): okay this is so fun and funny. like feminism!

**rhyneston3** (8): Very loud, but that chromosomes line is great

**runaway3212** (8): Lizzo has confidence I aspire to have

**Sweetnsoursauce1** (8): always goes off

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): cute banger

**waluigiest** (8): more nuanced than a lot of vague feminist bops and it’s a great song regardless

**wavingwolves** (8): sometimes in this song i hear her saying ''like a bird'' and i think it's really funny. it elevates my experience for sure

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (8): i would take a president lizzo given my only option rn is biden

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.7): Nice bop

**cashewconstellation** (7.6): This is my first time hearing this song, and it's a bop!

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): Pet peeve with Lizzo: I love when she's singing, but I get annoyed at the "shouty/singy" parts, and this song is a perfect example. The beginning of the chorus sounds great and then she starts shouting :/

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Chorus was repetitive and slightly disappointing, but otherwise a very fun track.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): kinda too on the nose but so fun anyway

**Agusarg** (7): It's a better Sorry not Sorry, but that song was not so great in the first place. Her voice sounds good though

**anagalisgv** (7): something about the production on this irks me but otherwise love it

**mayolizard** (7): lastfm tells me i listened to this 24 times but i literally… hmm.

**Nickl00** (7): I like the lyrics but it’s still SO loud

**vhqv1997** (7): This sounds a lot like a Katy Perry meet Jessie J song. The way that prechorus and chorus flow are just trademark Max Martin almost.

**radiofan15** (6.7): This is... kinda generic TBH, like typical inspirational and empowering shit made to be used on a movie trailer generic

**george\_kaito** (6): 2015 teas

**Johnnytoby** (6): she's like a girl and she's not sorry

**Kromorei** (6): well

**nick1372** (6): a bit too corny for me

**skargardin** (6): it's a bop but something about this is really messy, especially the chorus

**vayyiqra** (6): Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes wtf a TERF anthem I hate Lizzo now If you feel like a girl, then you real like a girl wait nvm thank you based Lizzo

**LeninaCrowne94** (4.5): Yup this sure is a Lizzo song

**mms82** (4.5): honestly her shouting like a girl is kinda annoying

**anothertown** (4): She has the line about “if you feel like a girl” but also talks about chromosomes and hormones, like ok. Ok. This also sounds like it came from 2008

**nooodisaster** (4): There's one good line here and it's suspect.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): the chorus sounds like noise

**goldentayslight** (1): ummm lizzo sweetie what is dis

**waluigiest** (5): once the dentist told me my teeth were beyond invisalign

**wardrum5** (4): I literally didn't know what was happening on this track for months. I thought it was just silence followed by murmuring and "this is the album haahahhah." Now that I know it's her removing her invasilgn, I wish it didn't exist

**ladililn** (3): Look I’m glad they had fun but that sound is the grossest.

A viral hit, a song played to sexy boys, sexy lizards, sexy dogs, the limits are endless, and y’all get it out right before day 3. Unacceptable. 

She’s not perfect, but DAMN I don’t think Lizzo has ever missed with her singles in terms of catchiness and bubbliness. I want to live in a world soundtracked by Lizzo’s singles. 

---

**untutorable** (11): BIG BOP

**bandnitos** (10): i felt this

**bespectacIed** (10): It's so nice of Lizzo to make a song about the ONE sector of society that don't deserve human rights

**bulforster** (10): Y'all better have been nice to her after she called us gays her faves.

**CarlieScion** (10): me

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): omg one of my favorite club memories involves this song and good friends ugh i love it

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): *mario coin sound*

**ggodisawomann** (10): ugh one of Lizzo's best songs ever, this so deserves a true rerelease

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): A mega bop, it might not have aged that well but it’s still great. There's something honestly refreshing about this track. True Lizzo moans her way through that breathy, seductive pre-chorus where she reaffirms that she "just wants to freak [us]," but the rest of the track is almost... innocent? in a weird sort of way? She's celebrating boys as people, not just sexual objects, and I don't feel like we see that a lot. There's a vibe of "boys will be boys" about this track where it manages to separate all of the nasty baggage from masculinity and just cuts to the fun parts. I hate its placement right after “Lingerie” though, it completely kills the mood.

**hikkaru** (10): guitar solo fucks

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking YAS

**jayjaysortagay** (10): Your. Fave. Could. Never. High quality, relatable content.

**JunkyGS** (10): Gay Rights!

**Kanne\_** (10): love love love it, will never be over this song

**kappyko** (10): Yas

**lapascalia** (10): Doing this rate made me realize I was missing out on this song!

**ManofOranges** (10): The first Lizzo song that I heard and the first one that I truly loved. I heard this song back when it first came out and I was hooked from the get go. It's absolutely amazing to listen. I salivate over this song because of how good it sounds. It's catchy, it's fun, and it's that bitch.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song is just pure fun.

**Nickl00** (10): ahhh the bass and Lizzo are so fucking incredible

**pearllouise** (10): Lizzo singlehandedly ended sexism and gave the men what they needed. I live.

**rhyneston3** (10): I love boys!

**runaway3212** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLxq7CFuKKE

**skargardin** (10): BOP ALERT

**strangergravityfalls** (10): me :handshake: lizzo :handshake: charli xcx: busy thinking about boys

**TiltControls** (10): relatable

**twat\_brained** (10): slapper. I will never love boys as much as I love girls but damn if 'zo doesn't compel me with her bars

**waluigiest** (10): Lizzo naming boys changed my life in 2018

**1998tweety** (9.5): Massive bop.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Bop!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): A real shame this never got the attention it deserves.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Tag yourself: I like big boys, a big beard, and I am also asking what's 2+2

**Agusarg** (9): Loved it since it first came out, such a fun song

**Awkward\_King** (9): im gay

**Belle-Et-La-Bete** (9): I remember this song from OLs too! So much fun with the crowd

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I love how this and Charli's version of Boys both share the same message in their own ways.

**Johnnytoby** (9): same

**ladywolvs** (9): i like it but i'm a lesbian so can't relate

**muchopartymuchomoney** (9): im bringin SexyBoys, YEAH

**nick1372** (9): HOW did this one not pop off

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): good song but would clearly be improved with mario coin sounds

**rickikardashian** (9): the transition from lingerie to this is **rough**

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This is somehow the only song from the main rate that I haven’t already heard before doing the rate and I’m sad that I haven’t heard it sooner, I love the guitar in this

**wasian-invasion** (9): I too like boys

**radiofan15** (8.4): Why is this SexyBack as done by Bruno Mars?

**avenueroy** (8.2): The second verse is amazing and iconic, but it also reminds me of that part in "Just Lose It" by Eminem where he's calling all different types of girls down to the dance floor for "a little romance or butt squeezing"

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Outsold Charli, when will your fave?

**dreamingoutloud92** (8): I love the different music styles she plays with, the production keeps the album fresh and easy to listen to.

**leviswift13** (8): this is what iggy azeala thought she was doing

**NotWith10000Men** (8): this song is fucking fun

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Bi anthem

**vayyiqra** (8): wtf this is kinda based tho

**wavingwolves** (8): a tik tok hit that ENDED charli's boys

**E3-NotTheConvention** (7.6): This sounds like what Justin's Sexyback would sound if it was made for a youtube ad.

**ladililn** (7.5): When it comes to songs about liking all kinds of boys, I prefer Charli’s, and when it comes to songs about how Lizzo doesn’t discriminate in her lovers I prefer Better in Color. Second place ain’t bad, though.

**meiscool132** (7.5): I'm listening to this album for the first time and I knew this song from tiktok, I think that says enough

**Whimsical\_Ferret** (7.5): men don't deserve this much credit

**cleen\_claire** (7): Charli did it better but this is good too

**hadea0090** (7): one of the lowkey songs on the album. I don't know if this vocal delivery works for her

**nooodisaster** (7): Love the word games here, it's just silly stupid fun.

**Stryxen** (7): some girls made me be the Pretty Boy in their tiktok and I still don’t know how to cope with that

**WeastofEden44** (7): Cute bop

**Kromorei** (6.5): improvement

**cremeebrulee** (6): idk i wanna love this but this song just bores me

**JanuaryFourteenth** (6): This is kinda boring but that transition NUTS

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): The meme potential here

**mayolizard** (6): da gay representation yas

**puberty1** (6): i was never a fan of this one even when it was first released tbh

**fadedblue09** (5.8): A bit forgettable compared to the others. The instrumental here is cool though.

**Brendon-Urine** (5): gay rights (but also overrated)

**Mysario** (3.4): that second verse goes OFF but otherwise, this ain't it chief

**FluffyNobody** (3): I am just waiting for this album to end honestly

**vhqv1997** (2): Bruh

**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): Okay but gets repetitive and annoying over time

**george\_kaito** (0): meghan trainor teas

(No seriously, I know her music is not my taste, and I know other people love it and it's okay. If I could've not given it a rate I would, since I listened it for the first time for the rate and it gave me 0 reasons to go back to it)

FluffyNobody: Spoilers, but Juice got a 10 from me, and Like a girl got a 9. I was really excited at the beginning considering I loved both songs, but then the album nosedived as far as I'm concerned (which! Is a personal opinion! I'm sure many people love this album and hate some of the stuff I listen to, and it's okay)

fadedblue09: Lmao the comments in the rate announcement thread saying Taylor would dominate have aged VERY poorly. [And I thought I was the one out of touch](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ftldf8/2019_main_pop_girls_rate_ariana_grandebillie/fm7qfcl?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

Anyway, I'm happy my 11 made it to Day 3 after flopping several times in the last rates I've participated in.

ReallyCreative: Arianators were underestimated this rate and they seem to have taken it personally. Billie is also doing better than expected.

fadedblue09: I did my part in dragging a fair share of Ariana's tracks so I'm not responsible for that. 

But for real, did no one consider her a frontrunner? She had the success, the acclaim, the huge fanbase size, etc. I'm not really surprised by this tbh.

runaway3212: Okay some final thought, I didn’t really mind yesterday but I hated today. There are a lot of songs that deserved better, but personally Jerome and I Love You feel robbed the most. I’m sad my 11 (afterglow) is out but I kinda expected it, it’s not that popular here (or anywhere else on the internet). I really don’t know who I want to win to be honest, Juice is really good, ghostin is pretty, Cruel Summer as a middle finger from Taylor herself. Bury a friend is not top 20 and I don’t know why it’s still in. Finally I hope the bad guy remix has an average of 1.000 what a truly disgusting song.

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I am honestly sad Afterglow went out early as well. It's also my 11 cause I thought it's a stand-out track on Lover that has a big chance of winning. I was so wrong.

If Taylor doesn't win, Juice has to win the rate. Otherwise, I am fine with "thank u, next" winning but it's unlikely.

ignitethephoenix: One of my favourite Ari songs (In My head) went out and some of my favourite Taylor songs also were placed badly, but the one I’m most mad about is boys and water me being completely robbed of day 3. Lizzo deserves better!
