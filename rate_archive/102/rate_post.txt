What it is, foxy mamas and closet disco queens? Ready for the grooviest, niftiest, most out of sight rate to get your groove on? Ready to feel the funk? Get down? And more importantly, **BOOGIE?** [It’s the jive turkey himself, /u/ImADudeDuh lettin’ you know what’s the skinny.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5cb6f4a267bd933f1d7be7ad5df57729/tumblr_inline_p7qee2omko1r4x5x7_1280.png)

Ok, I was gonna continue this 70s lingo bit for longer, but I accidentally used a word that I read referred to guys that liked disco music, but it turned out it is now a racial slur so I’m stopping myself.

So yes! Welcome to the Classic Disco Singles Rate! Here, we will be celebrating one of the most overhated genres of all time due to racism, homophobia, and the AIDS epidemic! Disco music originated from the club/urban nightlife scene and was full of sexual liberation, dancing and drugs. Musically, disco was categorized by its synths, basslines, strings, and steady beats. In a couple years, it became the biggest trend towards the end of the 70s, until the overplay of disco got too much for american’s to handle and they spent the first 2 years of the 80s only letting bland ballads become hits. 

But enough negativity! Disco has been an inspiration for so many songs since it’s popularity ended. Even this year, it became the sound of pop music (for r/popheads users who willfully ignore rap/trap/tik tok hits/anything that isn’t """"pure pop"""" music from this year). Looking back at disco with rose colored glasses, it was a great time, full of fun music that let anyone be as flamboyant as they please. So time to settle it, what is the best song from this genre left to time?

#RULES/INSTRUCTIONS

* We will be rating **65 songs** in this rate, and yes, **YOU MUST RATE THEM ALL FOR YOUR SCORES TO COUNT**. In this case, rating the single edits of songs is alright, since most of these songs can go on for +6 minutes and some are over 10 minutes long *stares angrily at Marvin and Donna*

* Assign a score to each song between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, so long as they are to one decimal place (i.e. 5.4 is fine, 5.42 is not). Also, please use periods (.) for the decimal places and not commas (,)

* You may give **ONE** song an 11 and **ONE** song a 0. Reserve these scores for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate.

* The only place you should submit your scores is at the preprepared link found below. 

* Feel free to change your scores at any time up to the due date, just PM me about it.

* I reserved the right to reject and ask you to resubmit any ballot if I feel you are unfairly sabotaging any of the artists and/or have obviously inflated differences between them (but I’m not worried about Diana Ross stans going against KC & The Sunshine Band stans)

* If you would like to add a comment to your scores **(which is encouraged!!)**, the correct way to format them can be found below. 

> Donna Summer - Macarthur Park: 8 Looks like it’s a raindrop cake now

This is **THE ONLY WAY** to properly form comments.
