This is their most iconic song, yet the song that I find their vocals most annoying. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr_ShurKYMU) that has them going “ha ^ha *ha* HA” probably isn’t helping me like this but that video lives rent free in my mind, so i can’t help it. However, this song did save lives technically, since it’s used in CPR to help people know how fast to make chest compressions for someone in trouble. Thank you Bee Gees! Sorry you hate this song now! 

**Covering the Covers:** Lizzo made a cover of this song to play over the end credits of horror movie Happy Death Day 2U from 2019. This was made post-Juice but pre-Truth Hurts becomes a hit, which is a real weird part of the Lizzo timeline. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgob3_Z1qY) is a poppier version of the song that does have great vocals but the production needs work.

#the woman's men

**jsonphile** (11): literally impossible not to dance to

**patcheso8** (11): a fucking JAM

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): the bpm jokes associated with this are tired but i still love it

**benjamin\_boo** (10): Synonymous with disco for a reason.

**bespectacIed** (10): barry gibb shaking from the pressure ever since maurice and robin d-worded

**cocosairdep** (10): This was the first song I was ever obsessed with. There’s a video of me dancing to this song when I was 3/4 years old that my family always plays at family meetings and everybody laughs at.

**conceptualromance** (10): I always think of the scene from the Muppet Show when I hear this song, and I love that

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Really good despite being overused.

**Hielord** (10): I'm definitely alive with this song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this one is just a classic right here. This song, the image of just strutting down the street, it's forever etched into everyone's minds because of how iconic this song, and for good reason. How apt that a song called "Stayin Alive" is still alive culturally speaking.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): and yes it's just because of that scene from the office

**rslashpoopheads** (10): and when popheads lets a bunch of white men win a rate with mostly black artists

**Seanderlust** (10): Look, say what you want about this song, but this is the song that launched a thousand ships. The impact this had on culture is massive. And the lyrics are actually...good? AND it is a vibe?

**steelstepladder** (10): I mean... yeah

**vayyiqra** (10): It might be overplayed but it's literally saved lives so I can't fault it.

**wavingwolves** (10): i know this will receive 0s and be hated on enough so i have to show my appreciation doing just the opposite... i just wholeheartedly love this

**Mysario** (9.5): once I was afraid, I was petrified

**camerinian** (9): you ever accidentally make a beat so good that it can literally restart a heart

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): A song that was so perfectly of its time and genre that it not only made disco blow up in the mainstream, but it also promptly contributed to the entire genre’s overpopularity and rapid downfall.

**pat-rickstar** (9): A classic but I didn’t love it as much as I thought I did?

**rickikardashian** (9): at first i was afraid, i was petrified

**waluigiest** (9): truly a legendary song in the canon

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): a classic

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): can't not sing along to that chorus

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): I hate how this song shows up in every other commercial but it's still a classic

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): John Travolta eating a folded piece of pizza.

**CarlieScion** (8): we love a heart saving bop

**Kirby31200** (8): I'm not the biggest fan of Barry Gibb's vocals but the groove is undeniable

**loloeffeff** (8): a song so iconic they use it to teach CPR, kings of literally saving peoples lives with disco!

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): Just a classic

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): Insert "The Office" reference Part 1

#then perish

**CritneySpearz** (7): always reminds me of that dopey guy from Bushwacked

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): Deeply lame and not in a charming way

**skargardin** (5): take off the meme novelty of this song and it's kind of just there

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This song is annoying actually.

**purplechilipepper** (4): and it's only that high because it was useful when i was doing first aid training

**hikkaru** (0): i have always found this song ridiculously obnoxious

**MrSwearword** (0): NOPE. If there's one song that should never be considered emblematic or a representation of the 70s, it's this absolutely overrated terribly sung hogwash.

Let us ignore the fact that Earth, Wind and Fire said that this is the only disco song they’ve ever made, so their other two shouldn’t be in this rate. Boogie Wonderland is another classic. Featuring The Emotions that I didn’t credit in the rate because having no features just looks more aesthetically pleasing, I feel like all their voices work well together. I love the “all the love in the world can’t be gone” bridge and it just makes me feel so giddy. There’s not much to say but that isn’t a bad thing! 

**Covering the Covers:** What the fuck is it with 00s CG animated movies that had them using disco covers? [Brittany Murphy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdG2W4Vzs) had to make a cover of this for Happy Feet. I’ll be honest, I haven’t heard this one all the way through cause the tapping of the feet really sends me cause I definitely do not think of feet tapping when I hear that >!(masturbation)!<.

#All The Love in the world

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): impossible to hate

**camerinian** (10): It's kind of embarrassing to every other disco band how much more Earth Wind and Fire put into their compositions than basically any of their contemporaries.

**Hielord** (10): They play this song in heaven

**ignitethephoenix** (10): boppppppp

**jsonphile** (10): my first exposure to this song was a children's theatre production of Alice in Wonderland and it was so amazingly awful

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): A glorious song to listen to through high quality headphones, those layered harmonies are exquisite.

**ManofOranges** (10): This one is just pure joy, pure greatness. It takes me to Boogie Wonderland it really does.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): oh shit I forgot how much I liked earth wind and fire

**rslashpoopheads** (10): god they're so iconic

**steelstepladder** (10): Earth Wind and Fire do disco better than any other artist in the rate

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): EW&F is one of those bands that honestly its truly a set up whenever a white artist gets roped into cover them. Dont do it, only you can prevent black twitter dragging you

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): I always remember this song as "Boogie wants to Dance" because that was the lyric my mum heard since she was a kid, and she didn't even realise it was wrong until I was like 10.

**Seanderlust** (9.8): The vocals on "I start to dance when...." towards the end pushed this up a solid point.

**Mysario** (9.6): [p good film](https://youtu.be/rNIiO6_o8Gs) (and no it's not Happy Feet)

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): A really good collaboration that shows a lot of strengths from both groups!

**waluigiest** (9): I did an Earth Wind and Fire marching band show in high school lmao. This was our iconic closer (justice for In The Stone!!!)

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Everybody knows and loves this song!

**bbfan132** (8): not in love with this but it’s enjoyable enough

**vayyiqra** (8): Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.

#eww boogers

**conceptualromance** (7): Not the most wondrous of wonderlands tbh

**MrSwearword** (7): cute but against the others, this is kind of weak.

**skargardin** (7): a vibe

**wavingwolves** (7): nose = booger wonderland

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): There’s some good parts of this song (I like the pre-chorus) but god is that chorus grating.

…………………… YOUNG MAN! It’s crazy to think a song as iconic and synonymous with disco as YMCA was originally gonna be a random album track, but it’s clear that YMCA is much more than a song. It’s also a dance! There’s so much to love about the song. The horns, the happiness, the propaganda for something that ISNT the armed forces, and hanging out with all the boys. What’s better than that? Just guys being dudes. Even though YMCA is now just known as “The Y,” there’s no denying this gay anthem will still get people to only call it YMCA for the rest of time. 

**Covering the Covers:** Uh oh! Everyone’s least favorite yellow things, The Minions sang [their own version of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmpTf7Ala2g) at the end of Despicable Me 2. And they sung it in Minionese! How about that.

#hangin' out with the bois

**Kirby31200** (11): Equally enjoyable to 2 year olds and 102 year olds. It kills everywhere from Christian youth groups meetings to bar karaoke to football games. Has had the entire world singing about cruising for decades. A pop culture staple.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic bop

**bespectacIed** (10): Literally the most popular song of all time, more than Happy Birthday or the ABCs, and that's not exaggeration. I bet even aliens bop to this

**bulforster** (10): A cruising anthem for the whole family!

**CarlieScion** (10): gay

**ignitethephoenix** (10): gay anthem that is celebrated by straight white people at weddings

**JunkyGS** (10): Invented cruising

**loloeffeff** (10): honestly the village people make me proud to be gay

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm just obsessed with this song. Who doesn't love to spell things with their arms?

**MrSwearword** (10): Even I'm not denying them full marks here, it's cheesy and gay but all the better for it

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I can forgive 'in the navy' just bc of this iconic song

**purplechilipepper** (10): this shit slaps yo

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Say the line, Village People!

**skargardin** (10): i dont think the straight bros in middle school who listened to this realised how fucking gay it is SFJGSJ

**vayyiqra** (10): Just me and the boys hanging out at the YMCA being totally not gay and having a good time.

**wavingwolves** (10): on top of being so gay this is also so motivacional... which is everything i need from a song tbh

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): im crying why is the phineas and ferb version stuck in my head

**Mysario** (9.7): fantastic song all around unlike the actual place cause I remember when I went to the YMCA as a kid, there was a counselor there that would hit me and I told my parents so they talked to them about it and they said I was lying and all these memories come flooding back to me every time I get shot out in space and end up not being The Imposter, so no Village People, there was nothing fun there for me

**camerinian** (9.5): who cares what score I put for this, this song is going to outlive all of us, and outlive all of our descendants. This is what people in the future are going to call a folk tune of humanity

**conceptualromance** (9): I completely associate this song with being in elementary school

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): i never realised how gay this song is until i rated it lmao

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): summer camps ruined this song for me tbh it's gay rights though

**Seanderlust** (8.1): "it has been alternately interpreted as a gay anthem due to the Association’s reputation as a popular cruising and hookup spot for young men. Victor Willis, one of the song’s co-writers and lead singer, said through his publicist that it wasn’t intended to be seen that way, but rather as an anthem for hanging out with your straight buddies at that place."

**pat-rickstar** (8): Probably going to be done dirty because it’s a meme but it's lowkey kinda good

#whY Oh whY

**benjamin\_boo** (7): The Village People are corny and this song is especially corny and reminds me of a roller rink

**CritneySpearz** (7): honestly if str8 whites didn’t ruin this song with their cringey dances to this song, it would be a gay anthem. However, as usual, str8s ruin everything for me. DisgUSTENG!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Just gonna say it, this song is kind of overrated. Like it’s better than what a lot of artists will put out in their time but like, they have much better songs than this I think it’s just the meme appeal that’s taken this one this far.

**steelstepladder** (5): The Village People songs are classics but man oh man they fail the "would I ever listen to this on my own" test

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): this song is an abomination against g-d.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): No.

**bbfan132** (0): i will never like this song, it’s way too tacky and none of the memes made about this song are funny

**waluigiest** (0): love what they’re doing here but white suburbia has ruined this for me

Now I do think this is a bop, but in the pantheon of MJ songs, this isn’t in the top. Groovy as fuck and full of his iconic vocals and noises (that OOWW! that opens the song is the definition of iconic) it’s a fun song, but I wouldn’t call it one of *the* MJ songs. 

**Covering the Covers:** Wow, finding a cover that’s somewhat interesting to talk about but i kinda found one. [Joe Dibrutto](https://open.spotify.com/track/4z49xE0XLzHiB6DqYqNsnx?si=A8uFqYERS6uGnT68bjslwA) had a version that was ok. Mainly, i just want to talk about the opening, what the fuck was that?

#Don't stop playing it!

**bbfan132** (10): his score will probably be tanked because of what he did but this and rock with you are easily two of the best songs in this rate imo, will never stop loving these tracks

**ignitethephoenix** (10): absolute classic for me. Also I wish MJ used his lower register more, I love the sound of it

**J\_Toe** (10): the lyrics can easily be misconstrued, but musically it's a 10/10

**ManofOranges** (10): This is just delicious to the ear.

**MrSwearword** (10): early MJ slays in his own right

**NotWith10000Men** (10): god this man made some HITS

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): king

**steelstepladder** (10): Still a top 5 Michael song

**vayyiqra** (10): B O P

**waluigiest** (10): true excellence

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Im gonna pretend like we're rating this on the original 6 minute version because the shortened one is too jarring for me.

**camerinian** (9.5): I really love the way Michael goes WHOOOO

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.5): it's okay to like MJ songs from before he molested kids right

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): such a classic intro and such an iconic chorus

**Seanderlust** (9.3): okay...I know how problematic MJ is, but...this one slaps

**bespectacIed** (9): kinda overrated but still good

**CarlieScion** (9): a MAJOR bop

**rslashpoopheads** (9): wew

**1998tweety** (8): this is alright

**wavingwolves** (8): yeah this is amazing and one of his best for sure

#Please. Stop. Immedialtely.

**Mysario** (7.1): enough already

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This song isn’t bad but it’s also, like, not really fun to listen to? It’s background noise.

**Kirby31200** (6): I'm sure it kills on the dancefloor but as a loser who doesn't dance I've always kind of found it annoying

Girl, this song is so fucking iconic idc. You KNOW I had to make sure the version we were rating was the version from the Shrek 2 Soundtrack because the Shrek 2 Soundtrack has been decided as the pinnacle of music for the past 16 years. This song got hooks on hooks on hooks. So many parts of this song are iconic. “Beep beep beep beep. Beep. BeepBeep ^Beep Beep Beep,” “Won’t you take me to. funkyTOWN!” “Well i talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it,” just constantly live rent-free in my mind. Not to mention that part where the guitar comes in on the bridge(?), ugh this song is just too good. No wonder it lives on the Shrek 2 Soundtrack AND in [Just Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmc8N9m8wIE) because just one wasn’t powerful enough to keep it contained. 

**Covering the Covers:** Did you guys want a rock version of Funkytown? No? Too fucking bad! 80s one hit wonder Pseudo Echo decided [to cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-itlGNap4) the one hit wonder for their only hit. It’s an electro rock version of Funkytown with basically none of the fun of the original. No one wants it!

#Funkmasters

**cremeebrulee** (11): the first thing i did in this rate was give this my 11 lol. this song was a huge part of my childhood weirdly enough so i just have such positive memories associated with it. not to mention it’s so addicting and fun

**Mysario** (11): this is one of my top songs of all time! I could go into the intracicies on why the song is perfect but instead I will share an anecdote. One time, I drove my friend 2 hours away to go spend nearly a week at the beach with his girlfriend and we listened to this on repeat the entire way and my friend was so happy, he couldn't stop banging his head to it! He accidentally kept on hitting his head on the dashboard but that's probably because he couldn't just wait to get to Funkytown! After we got there, the couple invited me to hang out with them and I knew from the look in his eyes that my friend wanted to keep on grooving to the energy - so now we all got to enjoy listening to this song together non stop for 5 more hours! My friend was so happy, he started crying, what a joyful day that was :,)

**1998tweety** (10): massive iconic bop

**bespectacIed** (10): the most perfect turn of the decade song. This is so equally 70s trippy and 80s flashy

**CarlieScion** (10): iconique shrek soundtrack song

**cocosairdep** (10): I wanted to give this one the 11 so badly, it’s my favourite of this list. And that Shrek 2 scene... However, I had to give it to IWS, it was more deserving of it. Just for the record, if I had another 11 I’d give it to this one.

**conceptualromance** (10): what can I say except Shrek 2

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Iconic. It won't win now, but it will win the inevitable Shrek 2 OST rate.

**Hielord** (10): Definition of fun

**hikkaru** (10): shrek

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Real 90’s kids know this song cause of Shrek 2

**J\_Toe** (10): I love Todd's video on this, and how it fueled Prince to outshine Lipps Inc as Minneapolis' most celebrated artist.

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this is just yet another iconic one. Thanks to Shrek 2, I know this song.

**MrSwearword** (10): stone cold classic

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this fucking song lmfao

**plastichaxan** (10): this is unironically one of the best songs ever made

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): iconic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is just SO INCREDIBLY CATCHY. Like OH MY GOD. The way the verse builds adding these little synths over time. Then the little breakdown before the chorus hits is so GOOD. AND THEN THE CHORUS AHHHH. SO. GOOD. Side note: my parents insist that the shitty cover by Pseudo Echo is the original and a part of me dies inside everytime I remember it, because they think that THIS is the INFERIOR version ugh

**rickikardashian** (10): my favorite trend was the one with people pretending to lip sync to different instruments in random songs, and it all started because of this song

**rosecoloreds** (10): the most iconic scene in cinematography wouldn't exist if it wasn't for this song... yes i'm talking about shrek 2

**rslashpoopheads** (10): invented shrek 2

**slimboyfriend** (10): y'all can trash talk this song all u want, but when i've heard it come on at the club, EVERYONE suddenly turns into a daft punk disco robot

**vayyiqra** (10): This song sounds like the song the band plays in Jabba's palace in Return of the Jedi (theatrical release) which is by no means a bad thing because this is a BOP. (We simply won't talk about the cursed video that was infamous on Reddit.)

**wavingwolves** (10): please this is such a meme song that it's hard to take it seriously but for for all intents and purposes it's still great

**sandyfishnets** (9.8): SHREK

**bbfan132** (9): i don’t love the verses but the guitar lick during the chorus and the sax solo redeem it

**jsonphile** (9): fantastic song but that beep beep beep beep synth line gets a bit annoying

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): An earworm for the ages.

**pat-rickstar** (9): The only better song on the Shrek 2 soundtrack is the Fairy Godmother's cover of Holding Out For A Hero

**skargardin** (9): massive banger, yes it's repetitive as fuck but i enjoy every second of it UGH

**waluigiest** (9): why haven’t we done a shrek soundtrack rate yet???

**Seanderlust** (8.3): you know what's fun? when your boyfriend falls asleep while the two of you are watching legend of korra and he wakes up while you're listening to this playlist and he's like "sorry, I hope you weren't too bored" and you have to be like "no it's cool, I was just vibing to funky town." anyways, great song.

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): Good memories of my childhood because of Shrek lmao

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Did this invent Vocaloids?

#Mind your business tf

**Kirby31200** (7): Why did you guys put the Shrek 2 soundtrack version

#don't you think that its boring how people talk about it talk about it talk about it talk about it?

**steelstepladder** (6): A perfect song that I would never listen to on my own

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): I've never liked this song, it's more obnoxious than anything but it's impossible to argue that it wasn't influential

I Feel Love is arguably one of the most important songs in pop music history in this rate. For one, it helped [popularize the 12” single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3epEnJAyu4), revolutionized how DJs in the club scene DJ their music, and helped sow the seeds for genres such as Trance, House, Techno, etc. Interestingly enough, no one involved in it’s creation ever thought anything much of it, nor did they even intend for it to be a single. I Feel Love feels other worldly and futuristic in a way that few songs even 40+ years in the future have managed to do. The almost entirely synthesized production, angelic vocals, and simple lyrics all work in tandem together to create a vision of pop music that feels ahead of it’s time yet. Listening to this song is an experience. Its takes you on a trip; whether its a trip through time, a trip on drugs, or a trip to a far away land, I don’t know nor do I really care. 

**Covering the Covers:** In 2019, Sam Smith released a cover of I Feel Love that may or may not have been made for Target commercials?? I’m still not sure. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZdE9QA-W4o) doesn’t change much about the song, moreso it “updates” it. It’s a pretty good cover, and was actually one of my most played songs in 2019. Not as good as the original obv, but definitely great.

---

#Its so good, its so good, its so good, its soooo gooooooood

**bbfan132** (11): giorgio moroder snapped here and so did donna - this is easily one of the most influential songs of all time and when you listen to it, you can easily tell why. that beat is hypnotic and her voice is entrancing as well; it really is a perfect song.

**conceptualromance** (11): I’m never forgiving Sam Smith and Target for what they did to this song

**however24** (11): Disco perfection

**JunkyGS** (11): Literally transformed music and genres for decades upon decades upon decades upon decades of time. I might like other songs better, but the sheer impact and influence of this song needs to be acknowledged.

**ManofOranges** (11): The progenitor of so much music we know and love today. I wrote part of my final paper in my pop music class on this song because it's just that iconic. Mrs. Summer was not just an artist on this song, but a pioneer.

**masttup** (11): Queen of being like 25 years ahead of her time!!

**nootnoot781** (11): honestly this is one of if not the most influential song of all time. this song is nothing short of a masterpiece

**plastichaxan** (11): i only did this rate so i could give this an 11

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): that bassline tho

**rosecoloreds** (11): literally the greatest song ever made

**waluigiest** (11): I say this frequently about a lot of songs but this is actually the best song ever written. It’s tight, it’s immaculate. The single version doesn’t do it justice but the full track has incredible peaks and valleys and takes the listener on such an incredible, glittery journey. If I had to pick one song to sum up my college party experience it would be this one - so many nights ended by dancing to the full version of this track at 3 am and it was GLORIOUS

**WillamThunderfuck** (11): This song came on when I did xtc for the first time, and while I loved the song before, it became associated with intense, sexy happiness after this experience for me. Best song from the QUEEN of disco.

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**benjamin\_boo** (10): MAGNIFIQUE!

**bespectacIed** (10): pete bellotte, giorgio moroder and donna legit created pop magic. Donna's most influential song imo, this sounds like every modern electronic album that music elitists cum for

**bulforster** (10): Literally invented electronic dance music

**CritneySpearz** (10): I forgot how good this is wtf

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Otherwordly and timeless.

**MrSwearword** (10): don't hate me, but it ain't her best song. It's a classic but there are better Donna songs to her name and in this rate.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I feel as though any other score would be wrong for one of the queen of disco's biggest songs

**purplechilipepper** (10): I would've given this my eleven but Rasputin just edged it out

**ReallyCreative** (10): where would synthpop be without this song, where would society be, I think we'd be literally still banging rocks together to make fire

**rslashpoopheads** (10): god I was so obsessed with this song as a kid btw sam smith ruined it don't @ me

**Seanderlust** (10): I've never sat down and listened to it before. Someone in the comments for this rate thread said it was an experience and they did not lie

**skargardin** (10): disco heaven right here

**vayyiqra** (10): BANGER; still sounds futuristic even today; helped normalize the female orgasm; Giorgio Moroder was a KING and Popheads wronged him in the nu-disco rate last month.

**wavingwolves** (10): this makes me feel things

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): Oh i dont think I ever knew the name of this, but I hear it in alot of commercials. The whole thing slaps though, I really love the track

**camerinian** (9.5): God I could just vibe out to this forever

**Hielord** (9): THE CLIMAX

**slimboyfriend** (9): a hallucinogenic in song form

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It’s not my fav song here but it’s definitely one of the most influential songs of all time. Paved the way for all of popheads synth pop favs and electronic music.

**steelstepladder** (8): It's so good it's so good it's so good

#I feel nothing

**jsonphile** (7): good, but just feels like a really long intro into something that never comes

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): I get that Summer and Moroder basically invented an entire genre of music with this song, but three minutes of Summer’s orgasmic cooing (or like eleven minutes if it’s the club mix) over Moroder’s harsh, trance-inducing beat just doesn’t do much for me, personally. It gets a 7 because I respect how important it is to the development of electronic dance music, however.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): This song is a super cinematic, ethereal experience, that I kinda wish had a bit more of a payoff to it

**Kirby31200** (4): Sounds like she's struggling to stay awake

**NotWith10000Men** (3): eeeeek too far out there for me

**patcheso8** (2): sorry I think this is overrated by y'all

**Mysario** (1.5): I feel nothing

Stereogum compared this song to The Box by Roddy Ricch. At first that seems absurd, but take a listen of each’s own “Ee-Urr” and “Toot Toot ^^Yeah Beep Beep” and it makes sense. Donna originally added it because she felt the song was too empty, and created one of the most iconic sounds in gay music. A song about prostitutes that manages to be fun and bouncy, Bad Girls is a great song for the club and for anyone that just wants to feel like the baddest bitch in the room. Funnily enough, Donna Summer renounced this song and several of her other songs because she became a born again christian. Sad that she won’t be able to hear car horns without thinking of her iconic prostitution hit. 

**Covering the Covers:** I was originally gonna talk about the [unreleased Lil Kim and RuPaul collab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxY5WSx2-Hk) but that is more of a sample anyways. HOWEVER, possibly one of my favorite covers i’ve found, instead we have [Angelica Pickles’ cover in Rugrats in Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJXUYXhGQTM). Now, at first, the thought of seeing a song about prostitutes in a kids movie & sung by a three year old sounds like 🚨🚨🚨 moment, but its okay. The lyrics are changed to be about Angelica and her bad bitch self stealing cookies and candy from those dumb babies. Did i mention that this involves sumo backup singers that are voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, Billy West, and fucking TIM CURRY????? If you listen to just ONE of these covers out of curiosity, please please PLEASE let it be this one.

#traffic jams be like

**ReallyCreative** (10): TOOT TOOT heyyyyyyyy BEEP BEEP.

**skargardin** (10): toot toot!

**wavingwolves** (10): toot toot! beep beep!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): toot toot beep beep

**loloeffeff** (8): toot toot beep beep!

**pat-rickstar** (8): Toot toot beep beep

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): toot toot beep beep motherfuckers

**CarlieScion** (6): toot toot beep beep

#I've been a bad, bad girl

**Hielord** (11): I WANT TO BE A BAD GIRL SO BADLY

**bbfan132** (10): donna was probably my favorite singer from the disco era, she had countless excellent tracks and this is one of my favorites!

**benjamin\_boo** (10): ICONIQUE!

**bespectacIed** (10): this rate is basically a game of "what donna summer song is gonna win" lol. This probably will as it's the most iconic Donna song. It will be super deserved because toot toot hey beep beep invented onomatopoeia

**J\_Toe** (10): So many 11s in contention! All of Donna's songs could be 11s!

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): If I didn’t already give something else my 11 then this would’ve gotten it merely for the “toot toot - beep beep”.

**ManofOranges** (10): This one is just so, so, so good. The whistles, the beep-beeps and toot-toots, it's truly immaculate. During my history of pop music class that I took, I was so excited when we listened to this during class.

**MrSwearword** (10): a signature song, was used in an infamously trash LSFYL on Drag Race and is still iconique

**nootnoot781** (10): the transition from hot stuff to bad girls, stunning

**RandomHypnotica** (10): When I think of Disco, THIS is the song. It's got everything, the funky intstrumental with all sorts of instruments and random bits (the whistle ugh so good), the TOOT TOOT! BEEP BEEP!, Donna's iconic voice, the bad bitch energy, it's just so incredible and iconic

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): How much do you think nickelodeon had to pay to get this in rugrats in paris. I hope it was enough to make me go 'eat all the cOOoooOOoOOOokIiiEIIEIs' offkey every time i hear this. anyway the songs a banger

**slimboyfriend** (9.7): Donna Summer said do NOT police sex workers or femme bodies because they are also humans deserving of diginity!

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): wow she’s calling them bad girls just because they are strippers smh she is cancelled!1!!1

**waluigiest** (9): the anthem

**1998tweety** (8.5): bopt

**rslashpoopheads** (8): the beep beep heard round the world

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Think it's slightly overrated in the Donna Summer discography but still good

#you've been a bad, bad song

**Seanderlust** (6.6): This gets a slight boost for the iconic "toot toot, beep beep" and the music is fun but it does come off as awful judgey. I feel like this one didn't age well.

**Kirby31200** (6): Toot toot beep beep. I can imagine the individual elements being successfully combined into something less stupid

**vayyiqra** (1): I don't care if this is a hot take: I'm over this song. I hate the "bad girls/sad girls" alternation, hate the whistling, and the "beep beep" refrain. It's still a bop but I don't like it. It irritates me deeply.

After being discovered on The Gong Show (do many r/popheads users even know what that is?) Cheryl Lynn was ready to show her debut single to the world. That single was Got To Be Real. Cheryl Lynn has 2 big accomplishments that are part of the highest form of praise for any artist in this rate: she was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for this song, and was a part [of the Shark Tale soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1I1CC3r84Q). Got To Be Real has everything you want in a disco song: great energy, great vocals, and catchy as hell production. That horn riff... just... MWAH! I was surprised to see this song this high, but I was definitely not disappointed. 

**Covering the Covers:** Ok, let’s go back to that Shark Tale thing. So, Cheryl Lynn does have a song in the shark tale soundtrack… but it’s not even this song? And they DO have Got To Be Real in the soundtrack but its a cover by [Mary J Blige and Will Smith???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIi6ofDnla0). It doesn’t even change much of the original song besides adding a sung verse and a rap verse. Mary J Blige’s vocals are good, but the mixing on this song sounds like it was involved in the soundtrack of a shitt- oh.

---

#The real deal

**bespectacIed** (11): There are plenty of songs in this rate that captured the disco zeitgeist better than Got to Be Real, but I can't give my 11 to anything else and yes it's partly because of Paris is Burning lol. I stopped idealizing that docu long ago after learning its white producers didn't properly compensate those featured in it, but damn it if it's still one of my favorite movies of all time 😭 This song takes me back to 16 y/o baby gay me having just watched the hardships black/brown queer people had to endure just to express themselves and create queer culture ... when suddenly this optimistic song about living your truth played during the credits ... I think my mind exploded from the emotions lol. From then on, I can never disassociate Got To Be Real with queer liberation 😭 It's cheesy to put all of that in one song but idgaf!!!!! Outside of my personal attachment to it, this is still the best song in the rate: the amazing horns and bassline, cheryl's high notes and intricate adlibs, and the lyrics that pack so much joy in its simplicity. BEST SONG EVER!!! fuck y'all i'd be happy if this isn't at least top 10

**jd1z** (11): My favorite song from any genre

**letsallpoo** (11): this is the greatest song of all time

**valyse** (11): My #1 favorite song of all time.

**1998tweety** (10): Phi Phi won this and no one can tell me otherwise

**camerinian** (10): I can't explain it, this song just give some such a stupidly big smile. So good it has to change key halfway through and it still stays fresh

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): THE BRIDGE OH MY GAWD

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I actually listened to the album that this is from and it’s quite good, I wish she got more recognition for her body of work as opposed to just this song because she had some bops. This is the clear standout but I also love her songs “Star Love” and “Come In From The Rain”

**J\_Toe** (10): one of the most famous disco hooks (and it has stiff competition)

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Can you really call yourself gay if the way Cheryl Lynn belts “it’s got to be reeeeeaaaalllllll doesn’t give you goosebumps?

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is probably the definition of euphoria to me. It just feels so freeing to me, so comfortable in its own skin, so unapologetically happy, and I love it. This might be one of the first songs in this rate that I'd heard, at like a very young age, and it's stuck with me ever since.

**MrSwearword** (10): WHEW what a classic from someone who ended up winning the Gong Show. Besides a hella one-sided LSFYL between Alaska and Phi Phi O'Hara, this song makes me think of King of the Hill from the episode they were in Japan.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): , but again B O P

**Roxieloxie** (10): one of the most iconic intros in this rate.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): oh this GROOVES!

**slimboyfriend** (10): how can u not groove to this or scream along "TO be REAL!!"

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the song of every commercial and movie in the 90’s and early 2000’s for some reason

**benjamin\_boo** (9): Those harmonies. Those falsetto runs. Sublime.

**conceptualromance** (9): I do think immediately of the end credits of a mid-2000s rom com but that’s hardly a problem

**bbfan132** (8.5): when i hear this i immediately think of alaska and phi phi lmao

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): not a huge fan of how shrill some of the vocals get but it's the definition of a classic

**Hielord** (8.2): Phi Phi should have won that lip sync

**CarlieScion** (8): iconnery

**Seanderlust** (7.4): I don't care for the lyrics but BOY her vocal delivery sells it

**skargardin** (7): bop alert

#what happened to REAL music???

**steelstepladder** (7): solid enough but a bit weak against the field

**Kirby31200** (6): Repetitive but an amazing vocal performance

Good GOD what a classic this is. Blondie is probably one of my favorite old school bands and this song is one of the reasons why. Debbie makes her love sound like something she couldn’t give a fuck about it, and is even annoyed talking about it. It’s the opposite of melodramatic. While most of us today love this song, to most of Blondie’s original fans absolutely hated this song. Blondie came from the Punk scene of course, so you can imagine how upset their fans were finding out that they made a... d-d-d\*sc\* song. This got fans calling them sellouts or weak. However, Blondie doesn’t regret this song now, nor did they back then! Stand by your music! 

**Covering the Covers:** in 2014, supermodel Gisele Bündchen released a cover of the classic. [Her cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_DqsheyI0) is a generic runway EDM cover of this song. It’s probably the biggest downgrade in all of these covers from the original. I watched the video for 12 seconds and legitimately knew this was a supermodel and not a singer before i checked out its wikipedia. Blondie Sweetie i’m so sorry. **EMERGENCY EDIT** Wait a damn minute, Miley [just covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBPZELdVAT8) this at the iHeartRadio festival and she snapped. It really changes the song from the “couldn’t care less” attitude to a big loud rock song, and I feel like it misses the point of the original, still sounds great though.

#Heart of Gold

**agentofscranton** (11): easily one of the greatest songs of all time. the scene in the handmaid's tale when they use the orchestral remix. whew, what a moment.

**CarlieScion** (11): YES YES YES YES mfing stan blondie

**loloeffeff** (11): one of the best pop songs of all time point blank period!

**rickikardashian** (11): I'm just in love with this song, as soon as it starts, I'm Debbie Harry singing this song in a car with the ceiling down on a bright summer day

**1998tweety** (10): big bop

**bbfan132** (10): rapture is my favorite blondie song and i wish it was in this rate but this is just as perfect

**benjamin\_boo** (10): Certified CLASSIC.

**conceptualromance** (10): I love this song so much!

**J\_Toe** (10): Love the sample of this song in Work It my Missy Elliott! Also just love this song in general :)

**jd1z** (10): blondie is perfection

**ManofOranges** (10): I had no idea this was Blondie for the longest time because I had known Blondie for songs like "Call Me" and I just would not even think that the same band who made "Call Me" made this song. But, lo and behold, they did. This is yet another song that I had heard many, many times before actually knowing what it was called.

**MrSwearword** (10): Blondie's best song and you will deal accordingly. Nothing says legendary status like a fanbase calling them sellouts but still eating their words and the fact this started one of the first genre wars of disco vs. new wave.

**purplechilipepper** (10): ngl this song is on most of my playlists

**slimboyfriend** (10): The drumming on this is so underrated!

**steelstepladder** (10): This might be the best song in the rate but giving Blondie of all artists my 11 in a disco rate feels wrong

**vayyiqra** (10): Of course a blonde white woman doing disco has a shot at winning, so do your thing Popheads and propel this classic to the top.

**waluigiest** (10): I’ve never considered this disco but wow it’s one of my favorite songs

**wavingwolves** (10): i don't have anything to say about this song other than the fact it is perfect

**camerinian** (9.5): I love this song but if it wins I’ll be pretty mad given it’s only borderline disco in the first place, and also wh*te

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this was the first blondie song I heard and I still love it

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.5): An interesting disco song by non-disco artists trying to imitate the sound, “Heart of Glass” is nonetheless incredible unique, from Debbie Harry’s oh-so-cool delivery to the plinking Roland drum machine preset.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): but WOW what an iconic moment

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): This was a song that I remembered better. I love everything about it, but I didn't realise it's basically just one section repeated 3 times, and in comparison to other songs here, which evolve and grow, it's just lacking a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Does anyone else remember this song from the first Just Dance game? That weird move where you would wave your arms over your head? That permanently altered my brain chemistry.

**Seanderlust** (8.5): "Blondie is my waifu" - Genius.com user DeepPool

**CritneySpearz** (8): justice for Call me, but I guess that’s not disco idk

**Roxieloxie** (8): yeah this is nice

**Hielord** (7.8): Her voice does sound like a beautifully crafted glass, somehow

#Heart to Break

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Well

**WillamThunderfuck** (6): Sorry, I've never been able to get this song

**Kirby31200** (5): I've always thought I should like this more than I do

**bespectacIed** (2): overrated and shrill. Though it isn't disco, Call Me better

**Mysario** (0): fart of ass

My second choice for an 11 *Cher voice* is a fucking Oscar winner! Last Dance is a breathtaking song. It starts off a slow ballad just yearning about going home with someone at the end of the night or maybe its about seeing if a lover will be *the one* for you. The beginning with Donna’s cooing vocals, into her more powerful vocals by the end is just incredible. Then horns come in just at the right moment and you realize you’re in for a ride. When she hits that NOTE on the second chorus, ugh you’re fave could never. This is a great show of her vocals. And while you’re having such a great time, the song ends with such a punctuated finale note. It really brings the whole song together. Also, stan Ra’Jah O’Hara. 

**Covering the Cover:** Oh god, ariana grande did a cover in 2011. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=115EsNrEqWw) is just…. Yikes. I really don’t know what her producers were doing here and her vocals definitely weren’t fully fleshed out here. It’s almost a kidz bop version but I legitimately think a Kidz Bop cover would have better production than this. OOF!

---

#Dance that dance

**benjamin\_boo** (11): CLASSIQUE!

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): If humanity was about to be destroyed and I had to beam one song into space as our legacy, it would be this one.

**slimboyfriend** (11): I've lived an entire lifetime after having listend to the full

**1998tweety** (10): ugh what a massive bop, a contender for my 11.

**bbfan132** (10): perfection.

**bespectacIed** (10): classic

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): "How dare you. You, first and foremost, are not sickening. At All. You are literally wearing trash. I'm not gagging. I mean I'm gagging at, from like, sniff the smell. It's like, bitch, do you bathe?"

**jsonphile** (10): the moment the beat kicks in is one of the greatest moments in disco music

**letsallpoo** (10): scarlet is fucking dead

**ManofOranges** (10): BEAUTIFUL. Every single thing about this song is just BEAUTIFUL. The way it starts off slow, with Donna's vocalizing and then it suddenly speeds up. The first time I heard this song I was not expecting it all, and I was taken to another dimension when it happened. There's not a single part of this song that I don't like. In fact, I hate listening to the single version of this song because that version is worse, based solely off the fact that it's shorter. I seriously am not sure if I wanna give this my 11 or if I wanna give it to I Feel Love.

**MrSwearword** (10): Don't you love when a song starts off slow and then kicks the gay into overdrive? Also, Ra'jah O'Hara deserves tens for her LSFYL against Scarlet Envy's glitter

**pat-rickstar** (10): This has snuck up on me as an 11 contender?

**ReallyCreative** (10): I just want to know why Ms. Donna is left with this half-baked version when the full version is absolute perfection... I smell sabotage. The proper version to this song is nothing short of a masterpiece.

**rickikardashian** (10): that high note alone deserved my 11. i already hate myself for not giving it

**rslashpoopheads** (10): love it

**skargardin** (10): the way all of Donna's singles in this rate are straight tens we HAVE to stan

**succulentils** (10): You better werk Cameron Diaz!

**TiltControls** (10): honestly, this is probably the best of her singles. The slow intro, the tempo shift, the vocals, everything really comes together with this song. (And unlike MacArthur Park the lyrics actually make sense!)

**waluigiest** (10): legendary song!! There’s so much joy here

**wavingwolves** (10): one of the best songs i know

**conceptualromance** (9): This is such a euphoric song!

**Seanderlust** (8.6): You know, kind of an aside, but you never really get very many good movie songs anymore. Besides actual musicals, I mean. and "Can't Stop The Feeling." That doesn't count.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I was so worried this was going to be a ballad but then she pulled though ... I stan

**steelstepladder** (8.5): solid all around

#i'm scolding this song

**CarlieScion** (7): i want to like this more than i do

God, Chaka Khan is such a good vocalist. She really is THE star of this song, which with these strings, is pretty impressive. Great production and great vocals make a great song, who would’ve thunk. Speaking of vocals, did you guys know that a 14 year-old Whitney Houston did some of the backing vocals on here? Speaking of which.... 

**Covering the Covers:** We have the Whitney Houston version of I’m Every Woman to talk about. [The link for the unannointed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_sqdkaAfo). Now, i’ll be honest, of course the Whitney version is good. However, the production on Whitney’s is worse *and* Chaka gave better vocals than Whitney did. Whitney does hit higher notes, but they sound thinner than Chaka’s highest notes. So, Chaka Khan >>> Whitney Houston.

#Its all in me (its = good taste)

**1998tweety** (10): we love TKB (except for the tr*nsphobia...)

**bbfan132** (10): love love love this, the whitney version is also wonderful

**bespectacIed** (10): Ugh such an iconic song that is deceptively feministic but actually a pick-me anthem lmao. I love this and Whitney's house/dancepop remix equally

**CritneySpearz** (10): me too

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): We do not deserve Chaka. She was this close to snatching my 11, but alas.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Better than the Whitney Houston version! The shitpost better be the Taylor Swift cover

**ignitethephoenix** (10): iconic

**J\_Toe** (10): did i just lose the weakest link?

**jd1z** (10): that voice

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): A classic of drag lipsynchs the world over, its full of attitude and Chaka really backs it up - you really do believe that she is “every” woman.

**ManofOranges** (10): Another iconic one right here, I think. I just really love the piano. Also Ms. Khan really just gives it all she's got.

**MrSwearword** (10): Trinity K. Bonet brought this song to LIFE.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): , but i wish i could go higher because BOP

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song absolutely surprised me. The melody is super infectious and catchy, the hook is ridiculously fun to sing, and it's just all around fantastic. Stunning. Shame the audio on the YouTube version sounds like it's a recording of the song being played off an iPhone 4

**ReallyCreative** (10): the fucking chord on "me," PLEASE inject that shit into my veins

**skargardin** (10): STAN CHAKA KHAN!!

**steelstepladder** (10): Can't believe Chaka Khan is Hillary Clinton, Joan of Arc, and Kristen Schaal all in one. Impressive

**succulentils** (10): The vastly superior version

**waluigiest** (10): stunning glorious 10/10 takes me out of my body

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.8): this song never gets old

**conceptualromance** (9.5): she contains multitudes!

**Hielord** (9.5): Each Whoah gives me life

**CarlieScion** (9): AAAAAH AAAAAAAH AAAAAAAAAH

**Roxieloxie** (9): Thinking about that time chaka khan was on phineas and ferb

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): I love it when women

**wavingwolves** (8.5): points were made!

**NotWith10000Men** (8): now THIS, this I like

**camerinian** (7): **Ben Shapiro wants to know your location**

#Erm ackshuwallee you can't phyisically be every woman

One of the more interesting songs in the context with  “Queen of Disco,” Hot Stuff is an attempt at a rock/disco combo that may have been inspired by Donna herself seeing the disco backlash coming. Hot Stuff is just a song about being certain about one thing: I. Want. Sex. It’s a great song. Also: I just realized that I misheard the lyrics of this song my whole life. I thought it was "Wanna share my love with a woman lover/ Wanna bring a wildman back home" which meant "I want a soft, kind lover now, but want a total freak in bed" but it's actually "Wanna share my love with a **warm-blooded lover**/ Wanna bring a wildman back home" so perhaps the sexism in me jumped out. Also, how surprising is it that this is the Donna Summer song that went the furthest in the rate? 

**Covering the Covers:** Pop singer eliZe released a eurodance/club cover of the song. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v-3Jf_lsnI) has a lot going on in it and a video that looks like it was filmed if quarantine happened in 2009. It's fine.

---

#I don't know what the fuck she's saying, but girl, I am living

**bbfan132** (10): i thought she said “wanna share my love with a woman lover” when i was younger… i was sad when i found out what the real lyrics were but the song is still a 10

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another hit. I don't even know what instrument or sound it is, but that one riff that plays during the song just goes off. Also, I know during the song she says "wanna bring a wild man back home" but when I first heard it I really thought she said "wanna bring a white man back home"

#Warm blooded lovers

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**benjamin\_boo** (10): FANTASTIQUE!

**bespectacIed** (10): queen of horny bops

**CarlieScion** (10): big bop

**Mysario** (9.9): I'd say I'd be shocked if this doesn't win but after running a rate and seeing people be tasteless all the time, I'm expecting cold stuff

**camerinian** (9.5): I strive to be this horny in everything I do

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Not to keep going on about Just Dance but here's another song on one of the games

**slimboyfriend** (9.4): Yes honey, I am stomping down the runway in these thigh high red leather boots feeling my Donna Summer fantasy honey, yes

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): Somehow gayer than I'm Coming Out

**Hielord** (8): Downloading Grindr for the thousandth time be like…

**vayyiqra** (8): 😳

#Burn victims

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): A classic, but honestly I think it's kinda lacking in comparison to the other tracks here

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Maybe blasphemous but I’ve never understood the lyrics or the appeal of this song. Donna Summer has too many good songs for me to want to listen to this one.

You know a song is fucking iconic when this is it’s [first four wikipedia sections](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/390648593331126273/747338365036265507/unknown.png) Objectively, one of the biggest and most iconic “gay anthem” of all time. I’m Coming Out was inspired by Nile Rodgers (Yup, he’s back!) going to a gay bar and “seeing three different drag queens dressed as Diana Ross, Rodgers imagined what it would be like if Ross were to come out of the closet…” It’s a song that’s just full of joy and so much fun at being free. Also, there’s a damn TROMBONE SOLO!!!!! I played trombone for 4 years of my childhood and it was all for NOTHING! But this solo really shows me “maybe if you stuck to it, you could’ve been a part of a cover of I’m Coming Out, you dumb bitch,” and you know what? I deserved it! 

**Covering the Covers:** Famous for 1 thing (literally), R&B hasbeen and [anti](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457327147175116831/550425051590295554/unknown.png)-[vaxxer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457327147175116831/550425591371792399/unknown.png) Amerie once made a cover of this song for the 2002 movie Maid in Manhattan. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StGo8ibu2iw) is very “early 00s badly produced R&B”. This sounds less like a gay anthem and more of a “listen, I don’t care if you like boys, girls, dogs, whatever, just don’t talk about it near me” anthem.

#Come out and play

**1998tweety** (11): ugh this song is so iconic for a reason, literally excellence

**J\_Toe** (11): an amazing empowerment anthem and knowing nod to the queer audiences that have loved and celebrated Diana Ross for decades!

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Just because Diana didn't want to be a gay icon doesn't mean she isn't one

**wavingwolves** (11): okay now this is TRULY a gay anthem. carly and charli wish they could make such a song, i bet

**agentofscranton** (10): that guitar riff is literally gay rights

**bbfan132** (10): accidental gay anthem but still iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): The not so subtle homophobic history behind this song will never not make me laugh lmaooo. Idc tho, diana is allowed! I decided to be an ariana stan after hearing the sample on Break of Your Heart Right Back tbh

**camerinian** (10): how many songs do you know that have a trombone solo sick enough to have its own wikipedia sub entry

**CarlieScion** (10): queen of coming out

**CritneySpearz** (10): homo anthem

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Maybe someday I will be able to share this song on my IG story with no context..

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Anyone who gives this a bad score is going to meet the “down with cis” bus in real life

**JunkyGS** (10): Invented Homosexuality

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): The quintessential Pride season classic I’m Coming Out’s legend begins with Nile Rogers of CHIC seeing drag queens impersonating Diana while out and about at disco clubs in NYC and was inspired by them to write a coming out anthem. Though she had been a long-time supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, Diana was hesitant to record such a song with such an unabashedly queer-positive message due to the potential public backlash, but the messaging of the song resonated with what was going on at the time in her personal life, with her declaring independence from the overbearing tutelage of Barry Gordy and Motown Records. While at uncertain juncture in her career as a solo artist for the first time, Diana took a leap with I’m Coming Out - which turned out to be a massive hit, proving the doubters that she would never make it solo wrong and firmly cementing her status as a gay icon.

**Kirby31200** (10): Invented gays and trombones

**ManofOranges** (10): The guitar!! The drums!! I know someone's gonna put the video of Asia O'Hara absolutely going off to this so I don't think I will, but that video perfectly exemplifies the type of energy I feel listening to this.

**MrSwearword** (10): Diana Ross' best song. Also, The Vixen showed how you perform to this song, which reminds me it took TEN SEASONS for Drag Race to use this song in a LSFYL.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): , i'm gay i'd be sent to gay hell if i didn't

**ReallyCreative** (10): literally one of the most timeless bops ever made

**Seanderlust** (10): A gay anthem. A trombone solo that SLAPS. A vibe.

**skargardin** (10): the influence and power this song has.. nothing short of iconic

**slimboyfriend** (10): This song could end after the first 50 seconds and it would still be one of the best songs ever recorded. The interplay between the vocals, the bass, the guitar, and the percussion at various points throughout the song SLAPS

**steelstepladder** (10): gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

**TiltControls** (10): prideheads don't let me down

**TragicKingdom1** (10): hopefully me someday :( anyways this is a literal gay anthem and has the best riff in the rate. runner-up for my 11

**waluigiest** (10): This has such a widespread cultural impact. It’s a gay anthem but she was literally tricked into performing it without knowing that’s the connotation it would have. Absolutely bonkers.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Gay Rights!

**Hielord** (9.3): Be Gay, Do Crimes, Spread Love

**Mysario** (9.3): I'm doing this on shuffle and this is the first one that came on. Yea, this rate was a great idea

**benjamin\_boo** (9): Gay Rights!

**conceptualromance** (9): Good for her!

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): i wish the opening 45 seconds was the entire song

**ignitethephoenix** (9): anyone who gives this a low score is against LGBTQ rights

**nootnoot781** (9): its a gay anthem and it also birthed mo money mo problems. what more could you want?

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): me in 20gayteen be like

**vayyiqra** (8): Song gay get it (I'm not gay).

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): (insert coming out joke here)

#just malicious gay f\*\*\*\*\*ry

**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): [insert 80 jokes about r/popheads being a den of homosexuals]

**RandomHypnotica** (4.9): Rumour has it, whenever someone joins /r/popheads, this song plays

I mean…… I MEAN………….. What can be say about September by Earth, Wind, and Fire that hasn’t already been completely gawked and fawned over? Only peaking at #8 (one spot higher than Toxic) September is one of the songs from the 70s that stood the test of time the best. Incredible harmonies, falsettos through the roof, and just everyone involved having a great time, makes a memorable song. Also, there is no significance to the 21st night of september, and Maurice White has said that they just wanted a lyric that fit the groove the best. But, we all know that’s a lie because they obviously wrote it for the birthday of Stephen King, Jason Derulo, and of course [Shaluron](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/484443487316607006/624830815469043722/image0.png). 

**Covering the Covers:** [Taylor, stop, you’re doing a bad cover of a classic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnDnphYTb0Q) Taylor! Tayl- oh god she can’t hear us over her banjo. TAYLOR! STOP! PLEASE! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

---

#oh... i remember......

**GlialUreterostenosis** (11): white guilt made me do it

**ignitethephoenix** (11): an absolute classic. Deserves top 5 in this rate and if it doesn’t I’m shutting down this subreddit (I’m a mod I have the power)

**NotWith10000Men** (11): did I know this was gonna be my 11 from the very beginning? Yes. Did I give any other songs a shot? No. does it matter? No. september is eternal.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, Taylor Swift outsold though

**bbfan132** (10): i… actually like taylor’s cover of this… but this is obviously the superior version

**bespectacIed** (10): Another song I think has a high chance to win. One of the most well-loved and instantly recognizable songs in music history. Remember when everyone jumped taylor when she did the most innocuous cover of this, simply cause she's ~yt~ taylor? A moment most pleasing to me

**camerinian** (10): all my family's birthdays are in September so maybe that biased me but also imagine disliking this at all like what would that say about you

**CarlieScion** (10): taylor outso... HA i cant even say it with a straight face!

**conceptualromance** (10): A great song for a lame month <3

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): OH THIS IS WHAT THIS SONG IS CALLED.

**however24** (10): Trendsetters

**jsonphile** (10): would've been my other 11 if we were allowed two

**JunkyGS** (10): This will probably win...

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): October is canceled, November found dead in a ditch, December apoplectic because all it has is Christmas carols. Such a joyful, jubilant song.

**Kirby31200** (10): I remember the 21st of September like it was today

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this one is just a straight up classic. This has to make top 10 if not top 5. Somehow this song has just endured through the years so well, probably because it's just so damn good.

**MrSwearword** (10): a song that gained public interest after black people roasted Taylor Swift for covering this terribly. The song itself is funky as fuck and deserves all the praise it gets.

**nootnoot781** (10): if i could give a second 11 this would be it. the serotonin this song gives me, it’s unparalleled

**pat-rickstar** (10): DO YOU REMEMBAHH

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Wow, didn't expect to see a Taylor Swift cover in this rate!

**rickikardashian** (10): the way i'm sending the scores on the 21st of september…………. the way the stars aligned wow

**Roxieloxie** (10): Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey, guess what today is :))))))) also please stream my favorite saga

**rslashpoopheads** (10): god they're so iconic

**Seanderlust** (10): This song is a meme for a reason. It slaps.

**skargardin** (10): heads will roll if this isn't in the top five at the very least

**slimboyfriend** (10): I've never truly known the level of joy I feel listening to this song

**steelstepladder** (10): how could I not

**TiltControls** (10): having this rate due on the 21st night of September is actually iconic

**vayyiqra** (10): It's not a good meme but also it is September my dudes.

**wavingwolves** (10): omg if this song won in the month of september it would be kinda iconic... i'm cheering for it

**Mysario** (9.2): @electrolemon

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): When I was in college the same guy would dj basically every single party that the theatre department kids had and this song was always on the playlist and it was always a highlight of the party, everyone would lose their minds when it came on. But then sometimes he’d play it again later in the party and let me tell you, there’s something profoundly unsatisfying about hearing “September” for the *second* time at a party. It’s like… the moment has passed.

**hikkaru** (9): taylor swift

**ReallyCreative** (9): It's really good but it's overrated. I'm still giving it the 9 it deserves but it's overrated

**waluigiest** (9): iconic for a good reason

#Taylor Swift did it better!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**jd1z** (8): would have preferred Shining Star or Got to Get You Into My Life, although I understand maybe they're not classic disco they're just better songs lol

**Hielord** (6.3): The last scene of Night At The Museum starts playing on my mind whenever I listen to this song

*dramatic piano riff to open this blurb* 

First I heard this song, I was just a child. Kept thinking this was just a song with nothing to really hide. But then I spent so many nights wondering “oh I think I like men,” so I listened again. And I learned it was an anthem. And so i’M BACK! Also I’m gay! I just walked in to finish this joke because I think it’s getting stale. 

But for real, this is THE gay anthem to end all gay anthems. Becoming an inspiration for gays dealing with homophobia and the AIDS epidemic. There’s something about Gloria’s strong vocals and positive attitude that gives it a weight. You can perform this angry and over it or happy and powerful and either way is correct. This is just mutually agreed by everyone as one of the greatest songs of all time, and who can deny it? Certainly not popheads considering it’s our RATE WINNER! This song recieved 45 10's btw

**Covering the Covers:** There’s been many covers of this song, so let’s go from the normal to the weird. [Diana "Rate Loser" Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaZxzxIv2w) made a very 90s pop version. [Demi Lovato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh3EUvi9b4Y) made an obviously screaming version in the Angry Birds soundtrack (again with the fucking CG animated movies). Alternative Rock group [CAKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9rCUQjmkxU) made a version that is soft rock and also some horns at the end and also John McCrea’s weird stutter vocals. And in 1979, Billie Jo Spears (no relation) had a [COUNTRY cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBfNABdKhZ0) that works surprisingly well and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance where she lost to Emmylou Harris. FLOP!

#I'm a survivor, i'm gonna make it

**cocosairdep** (11): This is, imo, the quintessential disco song. Instantly recognizable and everybody knows it. Plus it still slaps to this day.

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Because choosing an 11 among the Donna and Diana songs is a brave idea, and since I'm Every Woman isn't going to win, I'm settling for I Will Survive. Its signifance to queer culture is impossible to overlook. Moreover, "I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give" actually saved me from attempting suicide recently. Lovely.

**hikkaru** (11): [when i was a kid and my parents would play music that was mostly like classic rock and whatever and i didn't like it at all but then there was also this and suddenly i was bopping](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/745496962731606086.png?v=1)

**pat-rickstar** (11): It was actually easier than I expected to choose this for my 11, Donna had a few contenders but this is the winner for me

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic, a contender for my 11

**bbfan132** (10): probably going to win and understandably so, this is a stone cold classic

**bespectacIed** (10): Contender for the win. Landmark disco song. It's bittersweet how this disco song also work as anti-oppression anthems, fuck humanity

**camerinian** (10): I distinctly remember being at a Christian summer camp age like 12 and this song playing on the last night party, where I immediately mimed playing the piano intro and then straddling it as I belted the first verse and looking back yes I think that was my first gay experience

**CarlieScion** (10): iconnery

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of the most memorable songs from this era. This is such a big bop and uplifting song

**J\_Toe** (10): okay does anyone remember this flash animation of an alien singing this song circa 2002, ending with the alien being squished by a mirror ball?

**jd1z** (10): come on

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): An anthem of resilience that has served as a rallying cry throughout the decades for those who are resolute in their defiance and will to survive despite the challenges thrown at them by society, fate or circumstance. Gaynor really brings the necessary sense of drama that makes this a kiss-off song of the century, no matter whom or what it’s being sung at.

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this one is one for the history books. There should be not a soul who doesn't know this song. It just has that cultural implication, that impact, it's got the broadest of behavior.

**nootnoot781** (10): i may have done a few lip syncs to this song in my bedroom. and by a few i mean a sensible 74

**plastichaxan** (10): gay anthems only

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i mean it's the gay anthem of the century

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Insert "The Office" reference Part 2

**ReallyCreative** (10): apparently Demi Lovato covered this song, and while I don't really care I know this sub will, so I hope mentioning it here causes someone to start rageposting in the comments or something

**Roxieloxie** (10): iconic!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): The woman, the myth, the legend.

**Seanderlust** (10): TALENTED BRILLIANT AMAZING SHOW-STOPPING....

**skargardin** (10): an anthem for the ages

**slimboyfriend** (10): There's a reason this is a queer classic! And it's in her voice!

**succulentils** (10): Last year I went with my friends to a holiday party where someone sat at the piano and played tunes for everyone to sing along to. When this song started, this middle-aged gay turned to my friends and me (we were the youngest-looking people near him) and tried to check if we knew who sings this -_- THAT FUCKER WAS QUIZZING US. I knew the answer, but the audacity!! Later we sang Piano Man, AND THE SAME GUY PULLED OUT A HARMONICA AND PLAYED THE HARMONICA PART

**wavingwolves** (10): this would be kinda of a boring win but i can't be mad... this is SUCH a strong and amazing song

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): Iconic gay anthem

**Hielord** (9): It's a classic, anything less than 9 just feels wrong.

**steelstepladder** (9): easy day 3 and deserves

**waluigiest** (9): one of the best lip synchs in herstory 👁👄👁

**TiltControls** (8.7): that piano intro is iconic

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): bad bitch energy

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.4): Too overplayed for me to give it the score it likely deserves

**Mysario** (8.3): Cake version outsold but this is still me when this song comes on https://youtu.be/IdVcKrgSHHQ

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Did anyone else see the Angry Birds movie? The song that played over the credits was a Demi Lovato cover of this. Anyways, this song is iconic but if you actually listen to it… it’s kinda weird? But also this song knew I was gay before I was.

**vayyiqra** (8): Corny but fun.

#Neither one of you survived this rate (well i guess only you)

**MrSwearword** (7): it's fine and even has an infamous trash LSFYL from Drag Race to it but anyone saying this is the pinnacle of disco...NO.
