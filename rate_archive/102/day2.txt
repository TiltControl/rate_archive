lord_bingum: I was on a Donna Summer discography journey this week not even knowing about this rate and my god.. She’s amazing. I obviously knew some of her biggest song but Another Place And Time might be my favorite album of hers. Masterpiece.

Edit: Also shoutout to All Systems Go album. Highly underrated, but from the title track to the bop that is Dinner With Gershwin to the amazing duet Only The Fool Survives. This deserved better.

Are you guys ready to listen to the scandalous new genre of “Sex Rock” that’s currently filling up the airwaves and poisoning the minds of our children? People in the 70s were popping monocles at anything huh. Grounded by a good vocal hook, this is the better of KC’s two songs in this rate. It’s more interesting than Shake Your Booty, and its loads of fun. A song about sex that you definitely could not have sex to, but definitely a song for grooving. 

**Covering the Covers:** So whatcha want? Gay or straight? If you want straight, listen to [Spin Doctors featuring Biz Markie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvEpQyltiMI) from the SPACE JAM soundtrack with Biz Markie’s messy singing voice. If you want gay as fuck, listen to [Dead or Alive’s cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llHhiiNnIjY), which was actually their last single before they released You Spin Me Round. Watch the music video as well if you want giant crimped hair, gym bathrooms, and skimpy red swimsuits.

#Lucky for you that's what i like

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconicccccc. I can never disassociate this with the OG Dance Dance Revolution, that was such a fun era in life, making all the wrong steps on the dancepad

**J\_Toe** (10): I swear this song has been used in so many fast food ads. Or is that just localised to Australia? In fact, a number of songs from this rate are used for fast food. Why disco for Australian fast food advertising?

**MrSwearword** (10): it's a fucking classic even with it being of white people disco. Also, shoutout to the group for scoring a #11 Dance Club Play songs hit in "Give Me Some More (Aye Yai Yai)" with Tony Moran and Nile Rodgers.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): no way they'll win because men but this song is so fucking good

**Mysario** (9.4): KC perfected the art of the cheesy sound of the 70s and I like it like that

**conceptualromance** (9): the “oh’s” are my favorite part of this song

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Damn, Russian adverts really like using disco songs ☠

**steelstepladder** (9): The superior KC & the Sunshine band song

**vayyiqra** (9): Cheesy but it bops. We used to play this in music class and it fucked then and it still fucks now.

**Hielord** (8.8): The harmony at the start always gets me on the mood

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): Even four decades of being used in fast food advertisements can’t bring down the power of this song.

**CarlieScion** (8): AHA

**Roxieloxie** (8): wait wasnt this in rugrats in paris too? 70s disco rate more like rugrats rate

**NotWith10000Men** (7): fun but shit do get repetitive

**skargardin** (7): classic

**wavingwolves** (7): for some reason for years i thought a year without a rain by selena sampled this song? anyway this is such an ad song for me now but it still bops a little

#Julia Michaels - Uh Huh

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.8): too corny :(

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): the way this bands has classics but they are very one note as an entire song

**bbfan132** (6): ok i guess lol

**camerinian** (6): I can't listen to this song without imagining a Dreamworks-type cartoon horse shaking its ass at me

**jd1z** (6): Give It Up is a ten though as is Boogie Shoes

**ManofOranges** (5): To me, this song just doesn't really do anything. I've always confused this song with "Get Down On It," but like "Get Down On It" is a million times more interesting than this song, I think. It's not awful though, just disappointing.

**seanderlust** (4.5): I liked this song more than I thought I would, but still like 60% of this song is "uh-huh"

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Up until this very moment I thought that they wrote this song for *From Justin To Kelly*

**however24** (0): Sorry I just can't stand this one

The breakthrough hit for The Village People, Macho Man is the most femme masc4masc anthem ever. It can be seen as a self confidence anthem or it can be seen as 6 grown men lusting over each other’s hot bods. Listen, I’m gay with low self esteem so either way works for me and its getting a 10. It’s fun, it’s campy, and goddamn we need a song that just “look at how hot my body is” but for gays and not self centered. Before this blurb ends, can we talk about how there was a straight member of The Village People??? LMFAOOOO. 

**Covering the Covers:** Ehhh, fuck it. Let’s do a second Muppets cover of Village People. [This time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWLarBrwHF8) they have Macho Man sung by a bunch of leather pigs. I’m not joking. The Muppets really said “I’m dropping hints that this is for the gays,” huh?

---

#Your mind

**camerinian** (9): Why do we even need a census for this sub when we can just look at whether they made Drag Race or Simpsons references for this song to tell if they're gay or not (the bi's made meta bullshit like I did)

#Nacho Nacho Man

**1998tweety** (10): iconic bop

**bespectacIed** (10): The unabashed f4gg0try of this song is kinda iconic. Peppermint devoured alexis with this lipsync, one of the best performances in RPDR ever

**CarlieScion** (10): i AM a macho macho man thank u

**ManofOranges** (10): I can't stop thinking about the scene in Addams Family Values where Joan Cusack is in that bar with all the sailors and they're all singing this song.

**sandyfishnets** (10): that Debbie Jellinsky scene from Addams Family is iconic

**wavingwolves** (10): HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): probably their best song, there's just so much to love about this one

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.2): i'm more into chubby guys tbh

**waluigiest** (9): their best song imo

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): mucho mucho Macho Macho

**conceptualromance** (8): B O D Y

**ignitethephoenix** (8): invented masculinity

**letsallpoo** (8): alexis is fucking dead

**vayyiqra** (8): Every song by this band sound the same but the chorus is iconic and they made some based points here: To live a life of freedom, machos make a stand / Have your own lifestyles and ideals /Possess the strength of confidence, that's the skill All this time I thought this song was reifying gender roles and it turns out only you can define what being a macho man is.

**Mysario** (7.2): how did this group get it so right

**Hielord** (7): My mom still thinks they're straight lmao

**steelstepladder** (7): Macho Man > Hulk Hogan

**bbfan132** (6.5): i usually don’t like them but this is sort of fun lol

#Toxic Masculinity

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): the other three outsold this one by far

**seanderlust** (5.7): can't not hear the homer simpson version

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Dream big, my girls.

**MrSwearword** (5): why this song was chosen as a LSFYL I will never know, but shoutout to Peppermint who scalped Alexis Michelle to this. Also, this makes me think of the tasteless but hilarious Richard Simmons spoofing in the Nutty Professor.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): I guess village people peaked with ymca

**rslashpoopheads** (5): sure jan

After Nile Rodgers flopped with Daft Punk and Pharell on Get Lucky, it’s a shame he didn’t do that well here either! (jk he has a whole lot of songs in this rate) This song is a groove! Most of the song takes a backseat to the bassline and I don’t blame them. There’s a little bit of underlying sadness if you take a close look at the lyrics, but if you’re looking at the lyrics, you’re not enjoying this song right (and you might miss “Our new state of mind” which some people used to mistake for “Are you straight or bi?”) 

**Covering The Covers:** 90s R&B group Zhane released a cover of the song on their second and last album. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTdcH81a3hg) is a slower, more R&B influenced version. It’s too slow for my taste and kinda ruins the groove of the song.

---

#Good Times

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**bbfan132** (10): nile rodgers <3 <3

**bespectacIed** (10): Happiness in a song

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Nile Rogers is a goddamn LEGEND but sadly I feel like he and CHIC are going to be paid dust in this rate.

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm having a good time listening to this one.

**Roxieloxie** (10): is the the part of the rate where the songs turn into the soundtrack to any black family function

**wavingwolves** (10): this song is dragging me for being an overthinker and a worrier but it's still iconique!

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): But girls will be women.

**Kirby31200** (9): Nile Rodgers is a king

**steelstepladder** (9): Best baseline of the rate

**Mysario** (8.8): fittingly this was the final song I did in this rate but I put on the 9 minute version by accident... and it made me WISH we did the album versions for all these songs! almost all of the songs would've suffered so much more, especially since the natural attention span of a PH is the length of a Vine. Y'all remember Vine, right? Good times

**CarlieScion** (8): why does this sound like we are family

**ignitethephoenix** (8): love the groove of this but it’s not as exciting as I remember

**skargardin** (8): massive anthem

**vayyiqra** (8): Can we have some good times because so far this year has Not been It.

**MrSwearword** (7): the lesser of CHIC's songs, but give it this, Sugarhill Gang reworked this into Rapper's Delight and birthed a new genre in Hip-Hop

#Bad Times

**NotWith10000Men** (7): not as upbeat as I remembered

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I can't in good conscience give a disco song less than a 7.

**sandyfishnets** (7): Daft Punk really did just hit copy paste huh...

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): the iconic guitar licks bail this song out so hard

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Doesn’t need to be as long as it is.

**WillamThunderfuck** (5): It just lasts so long with barely anything happening for a good portion of the song

Honestly, I am not a big fan of this song. I feel somewhat meh on it, but it’s lifted up entirely by it’s great hook. “You can ring my b^^^^e ^^^^e ^^^^e ^^^^e ^^^e ^^^e ^^^e ^^e ^^e ^^e ^e ^e ^l ^l ^l ^l ^l ” as well as the kinda underrated *ring dong ring AHHhhh* on the last couple choruses are so damn catchy. It’s got me foot tapping, but that’s about it. 

**Covering the Covers:** 80s Australian pop star Collette covered the song as her debut single. Her [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC88T2ZIHSI) is a very late 80s produced pop cover of the song. It’s honestly not that good, and would be Collette’s only hit.

#Ring a ding ding

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): this song is my fuckin jam ok, just wanna sip sangria and get high every time i hear it.

**bespectacIed** (10): Anita Ward prettiest girl to ever live I think omggg. Stream also Girl's Day - Ring My Bell

**DrunkHurricane** (10): gonna erase the Eeeeeeeeearth erase the Earth

**Hielord** (10): I will never get tired of this song, like never.

**loloeffeff** (10): the 8 minute version of this is pure bliss

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is so damn catchy like the hook has been stuck in my head for a fucking week now. Now that's powerful!

**MrSwearword** (10): a lesser spoken about classic but still deserves marks for being iconic in its own right

**Roxieloxie** (10): oprah nodding gif

**sandyfishnets** (9.5): ah so funky

**benjamin\_boo** (9): Ring-a-ling-a-ling indeed.

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): This one really shocked me, I guess I’ve never actually ever listened to it with intention. Hooks upon hooks upon hooks - the synthesizer slide whistle? The “ringit-ringit-ringit” of the background singers?The COWBELL?! It’s incredible, earworm city.

**Kirby31200** (9): I really went in expecting to hate it because of the Walmart commercials but it's actually so good

**ReallyCreative** (9): I love the ookiness and spookiness of this one, it's just fun and a little unique

**waluigiest** (9): I get the chorus stuck in my head all the time

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): 🎵Gonna erase the eaaaaaaaaaaaarth, erase the earth 🎵

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): I'm going to make a trend of mentioning where I know these songs from since I wasn’t born anywhere near them being released: this one is on Just Dance!

**plastichaxan** (8.4): i wish i could think of something other than Maya Rudolph singing "gonna erase the eeeearth"

**seanderlust** (8.4): I used to be super into baseball and the Seattle Mariners. For a while we had a third baseman named David Bell and every time he came to bat, Safeco Field played this song. Now that I know the meaning....that's a neat thing from my childhood. Also, +1 point because this is one that I've been replaying over and over.

**camerinian** (8): I think it's funny how knock on wood and ring my bell are right next to each other on the ballot, homosexuality keeps winning

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): GONNA ERASE THE EAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTH, ERASE THE EARTH.

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah, I'm thinking about my doorbell / When ya gonna ring it, when you going to ring it?

**slimboyfriend** (7.7): more like DEMOLISH my bell, am I right?

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.2): killer chorus but it's all the song has

#Ring doorbells are spying americans you know

**bbfan132** (7): a pretty good song but it’s overly repetitive and that guitar tone or whatever it is grates on me... i know that a lot of people like this so i won’t be surprised if it makes it very far but it doesn’t fully click for me, unfortunately

**J\_Toe** (7): this would make for a good sample!

**jsonphile** (7): would be higher but just can't get into her voice

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I can't in good conscience give a disco song less than a 7.

**skargardin** (7): boppy!

**Mysario** (6.8): I think Amazon had a commercial where they had someone deliver a package and they rang their doorbell with this song playing, how funny hee hee ho ho!

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Good but a bit one note

**1998tweety** (6): kind of drags

**TiltControls** (6): rip disco janet

**jd1z** (5): shrill

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): I recognize the chorus but that sound in the first verse is annoying as FUCK

**CarlieScion** (4): why is this so quiet lmao

**wavingwolves** (0): kpop girlgroup girls day outsold! stream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4sN05-xIs4

Did you guys know that this song was a cover? I honestly had no idea until doing research for these lil blurbs. [The original is honestly really good too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kceiks__PsE) however, Amii really elevates the song to feel bigger and more fun. This song makes me want to dance more than any song here. This song just feels so positive and infectious. It’s incredible. This song is the definition of animated. Not to mention, it’s got a bunch of fun sound effects that gives any song not called “Groove Is In The Heart” a run for it’s money. 

**Covering the Covers:** As we discussed that this is a cover, another notable cover is from David Bowie. He recorded a version for his live album David Live. The cover is [a bluesy, rock cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf8KTeobuiM) of the song, and it’s also real good! I recommend anyone interested listen to it.

#It's like thunder *horns* lightning *horns*

**bespectacIed** (10): classic

**camerinian** (10): what the fuck why does this hit so hard that percussion groove is some mosh type shit

**CarlieScion** (10): the instrumental reminds me of chain reaction

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Classic.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One time this came on the radio and I said to my dad “did you know this song is a cover?” and he’s like “no it’s not” and I was like “yeah it was originally a blues song sung by Eddie Wood and then Amii Stewart covered it” and he’s like “who is Amii Stewart” and I was like “she’s the woman singing this” and he’s like “I assumed it was Gloria Gaynor” and I’m like wow, being a middle aged straight white man must be EXHAUSTING

**ignitethephoenix** (10): an absolute classic. First learnt about this song when I was 12 cause of dance class

**jd1z** (10): the production on this track i mean

**JunkyGS** (10): a B A N G E R

**MrSwearword** (10): YES GAWD this song knocks. Also, Alexis Mateo nailed this song back when Stacy Layne Matthews was taking tracks out of her hair to this.

**rickikardashian** (10): oh wow, an emma stone cover

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic hook

**skargardin** (10): yes MAAAAM this is a gay anthem

**conceptualromance** (9.5): Iconic

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): iconic from start to finish, the ENERGY this song has

**J\_Toe** (9): the visuals for this lp cover / music video are an absolute serve!

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Such a fun, upbeat, campy song!

**Kirby31200** (8): One of a surprising amount of songs in this rate I first learned from An Extremely Goofy Movie

**pat-rickstar** (8): This is associated with this one advert on british tv for me, but it's a bop either way

**steelstepladder** (8): Never knew the name of this song tbh but it's great

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): ok so what kinda wood we talking about

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): Solid if slightly forgettable.

**seanderlust** (7.5): I've tried to think of a clever way to reference Easy A, but I can't so I'm just going to go re-watch it.

**Mysario** (6.9): I own very few posters and one of them is for [one of the most underrated movies of all time](https://youtu.be/4ZztDT01CII)

#The way some people like this song is frightening

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**bbfan132** (6.5): sort of fun but pretty underwhelming

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): nice voice. The music dropping out is neat

**ManofOranges** (6): When I heard this song for the first time I was like "wait a minute hold on" because I had seen Easy A not even a few hours before, and it was a very surreal to hear the song in a disco rendition. I'm also gonna take this moment to say that I prefer the Easy A arrangement and I'm NOT sorry about it!

**wavingwolves** (6): i'm really used to david bowie's version of this song and while this is a really cool disco spin of the original it's just not as good

**sandyfishnets** (4): why did you have to destroy my ears within the first 10 seconds though

Turn the Beat Around was sung by a 22 year old Vicki Sue Robinson, and it’s a bop.For a song that describes itself plenty of times (talking about the flute, guitar scratching, rat-tat-tat-tat-tat on the drum), it’s got to have the instrumentation to back it up, and it sure does! I will say that this song doesn’t do a lot to stand out, but it does a great job at what it set out to do. 

**Covering the Covers:** Gloria Estefan is probably the most iconic latina in music before the 90s. [Her covering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inHwBUo9Pzk) this song really makes a lot more sense that it should. Surprisingly, this feels less danceable than most of her big hits, especially with the Miami Sound Machine.

#Loves to hear percussion

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): i will always remember diana degarmo’s iconic cover of this song on american idol 500 years ago lmao

**MrSwearword** (10): Never forget this song was recorded in ONE TAKE and used for JcPenney. Also hey Darienne Lake, you turned it to this song.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is so electric and I love how it doesn't let itself get too reptitive in the back half

**seanderlust** (10): "how many instruments do you want on this track, vicki?" "yes."

**conceptualromance** (9.5): LOVE to hear the percussion!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): another classic

**camerinian** (9): did you know this song had a rap verse???? I didn't but it's fucking sick wow

**bespectacIed** (8): oh it's THAT pitch perfect song

**Hielord** (8): LOVE TO HEAR THE CUSHIONS

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): Damn if the singer doesn’t give her all in this song.

**ManofOranges** (8): This is my first time listening to this song, and honestly I don't think that it's ~amazing~. This song just kind of feels like a meme to me for some reason. But the part where she's talking about the syncopated rhythm is pretty good though.

**steelstepladder** (8): boppity bop

**vayyiqra** (8): I play drums so I am glad someone likes to hear it.

**wavingwolves** (8): i like the change of sections a lot

**Mysario** (7.8): I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes

Prince is one of, if not is, my favorite 20th century artist. His work pre-1999 i don’t know too well, but this song is one of the exceptions. A very simple song on paper, but it’s fucking PRINCE so you know it’s gonna be a fucking bop through and through. It’s kinda crazy to think that this was his first hit single and when nowadays, Prince is practically synonymous with 20th century music. Also, can we talk about how Prince was only **21** when this song was released, the same age that people like Conan Gray, Madison Beer, and Lil Nas X are right now?? I don’t like thinking about that. 

**Covering the Covers:** Corinne Bailey Rae decided to put this Prince record on and liked it so much she wanted to cover it. [Her cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyC2bFFR-aI) is very 80s inspired but its production just seems messy.

---

#<3

**RandomHypnotica** (11): In a rate with so many quality songs, what makes this one stand out? I think it's just how sophisticated it sounds. If an artist released this today, it wouldn't sound a second out of date. That's the power of Prince, he truly is a timeless artist

**bbfan132** (10): this is up there with his 80s classics for me, it’s a perfectly made disco track even if it’s not as elaborate/innovative as his later stuff

**bespectacIed** (10): Winner contender and objectively the most well-crafted song in the rate. The bass, the synths, prince's voice ... glittered cum. The way Prince songs rarely sounded nostalgic to me because they always sound modern and polished and ahead of their time

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic, absolute smash

**J\_Toe** (10): I like a lot of Prince's music, but I think this is the best song to fit this playlist, even if I love his later music a lot more.

**jd1z** (10): he shoulda done more disco tbh

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): A finely-oiled machine of a song with an impossibly funky groove, tons of sexual innuendo sung in Prince’s sexy as hell falsetto, that absolutely killer outro - this track is a lesser-known gem from The Purple One’s early days. Fun fact: Prince performed every instrument on the album that this came on (!), that’s twenty-seven instruments (!!) and it was his debut as an artist when he was a mere nineteen years old (!!!) - he truly was an astounding, once in a generation/century talent, a savant of funk and a prodigy of pop.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is just. i can't even, my comment is too explicit.

**Roxieloxie** (10): he said what he said

**rslashpoopheads** (10): oh we groovin to this one

**seanderlust** (10): only prince can pull off a line like "I wanna be your mother and your sister".

**skargardin** (10): this is a SMASH

**steelstepladder** (10): Prince gets a 10

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): i wish prince did more disco songs :(

**1998tweety** (9): hot

**waluigiest** (9): I really need to listen to more Prince!!

**wavingwolves** (9): this makes me feel stuff i don't want to feel

**CarlieScion** (8): this was loooooooong

**ManofOranges** (8): This song falls in the same boat as "Shake Your Groove Thing" for me--it's pleasant to listen to but I stop paying attention and then realize the song is still going! It's just a bit too long for my liking. Still good though.

**camerinian** (7): I wish I liked Prince’s music more than I do, dude was talented but it does very little for me

**conceptualromance** (7): Not my favorite Prince song, still really good tho

**Kirby31200** (7): Not my cup of tea but it still sounds so fresh, like this could come out today

#I wanna love this song but I don't so...

**NotWith10000Men** (7): I feel blasphemous for this rating but I've never been a huge prince fan outside of his pop hits….

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Never understood the appeal of Prince personally, this song passes through my ears like air

**MrSwearword** (1): if you had to put Prince in a disco rate, "Sexy Dancer" was right there.

**succulentils** (0): I'm sorry but I can't stand this whiny falsetto

Donna Summer’s first single after signing to Casablanca and her first hit song, this song is pure secks. Clocking in at a full 16 minutes 50 seconds, this song is a great sexy song, even if it gets a little too extra at points. It was called TOO SCANDALOUS by the BBC when it was released, causing it to be banned. Also, Donna recorded the moans heard throughout this song while laying down in a dark recording studio and without the guys recording her looking at her. Thinking about how Donna was a born again christian about 7 years after this was released, I don’t think she was too happy to perform this for people. 

**Covering the Covers:** In a little movie called Zoolander, we get a cover of this song from a little band called No Doubt. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml8ftmptthI) weirdly keeps the pop rock/ska sound of the band, which, paired with Gwen’s baby vocals, is kinda one of the least sexy things I can think of.

#ahhhhhhhhh.......

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): she’s an icon, she is a legend, and she is the moment. the 17 minute version is absolutely superior but i’ll have to give my 11 to this for the time being

**skargardin** (11): this is so funky, sexy and seductive in the most perfect way. Giorgio and Donna did NOT have to snap this hard!! Stream the 17 minute original edit for the clearest of skins

**bbfan132** (10): now THIS is how you make a song sound genuinely sensual/sexual, people

**JunkyGS** (10): I swear if the typical "Virgin Conservative Heads" jumps out and makes this go out Day 1 or 2 since this is a sex song... you will be dealt with

**ManofOranges** (10): Damn, this song is sexy. It's kind of iconic how it was so sexy that it got banned by the BBC.

**MrSwearword** (10): One of my favorite things ever is finding out she recorded this song laying on her back saying she was inspired by Marilyn Monroe (which is lowkii shady as hell, being inspired to lay on her back because of her)

**Hielord** (7.2): Was this song always this horny? I don't remember lol

let me use this blurb to just share this hilarious story of the song. 

“This was written by Yorkshireman Mick Jackson. He wrote it for Stevie Wonder originally and he was asked by Global records, Munich to record the track himself. At the 1978 Midem Music Festival in Cannes, France it was played for the first time and a member of The Jacksons entourage was there searching for tracks. He was amazed by the name coincident and was impressed by the track itself. He secretly taped it and went back to the States so the band could record it as quickly as possible before Mick's version was released. There was a race to release the tracks - it was called "The Battle of the Boogie" in the newspapers and it was perfect press material: two Michael Jacksons, two versions of "Blame It On The Boogie." The songs were out within days of each other and it was one of the rare occasions in the modern day that artists charted the same time with the same song. Some fans preferred Mick Jackson's more soulful version and others the more uptempo Jackson's version. Mick Jackson's version reached #15 in the UK and #61 in the US.” 

**Covering the Covers:** So let’s talk about Mick Jackson. Wow, what a shitty version of the song. [The “original”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcDj46elLhQ) song feels so stiff in comparison with the fun of the original. It sounds like a song from the Partridge Family. But then again, are we shocked that [this guy](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aiHoZlfJL.jpg) is less funkier than The Jacksons?

---

#Blame it on my JUICE!

**Roxieloxie** (11): I really really love this song, im so glad it was included. My brother had a big jackson five phase awhile ago so this song would always be playing as we all left to go school. Also in my moms old shop she's have this on her playlist so i'd always see the music video. Its ironic that this is one of my favorite Jackson 5 songs cause its literally Micheal ft. His brothers. But this song is just so fun and happy I dont know how anyone can hate it

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE bop

**bbfan132** (10): always preferred can you feel it but this is probably more of a straightforward classic, very enjoyable track!

**bespectacIed** (10): i have not listened to michael's voice in a while and after being inundated by After Hours all year, I am hit by how much Abel patterned his singing style to him omg. The runs, the breathiness, the inflection. These birds copy every word every inch but michael got the hammer and the wrench

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): To have this much power at such a young age…

**J\_Toe** (10): the lyrics can easily be misconstrued but musically it's really good

**JunkyGS** (10): SOOOO UNDER RATED! SO GLAD ITS IN THIS RATE <3

**ReallyCreative** (10): probably my favorite song involving Michael, including his solo stuff, it's just so good from start to finish

**camerinian** (9): please tell me I'm not the only one in this rate who did Jump Jam

**ignitethephoenix** (9): for some reason I forgot Michael was an adult for this song even though it’s a Jackson’s song

**waluigiest** (9): I just can’t control my feet!!

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Although it would be higher I'm trying not to give out all 9.5s and 10s

**CarlieScion** (8): fun

**ManofOranges** (8): The first time I heard this song was actually in Pitch Perfect.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): he's really been hee heeing since the very beginning huh

**wavingwolves** (8): yeah it goes off

**Hielord** (7.8): NO CULPES A LA NOCHE

#Take responsibilities for your actions

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I can't in good conscience give a disco song less than a 7.

**conceptualromance** (6.5): I like the harmonies

**MrSwearword** (5): eh...it's fine but largely inconsequential

**steelstepladder** (5): a non essential listen for any fan of any Jackson

**seanderlust** (4): yes I do hate fun, why do you ask?

**loloeffeff** (0): sadly this one just reminds me of really lame weddings, school dances and bar/batmizvahs so...

This feels so special. Jackson’s verses have this soothing voice that feel intimate, and even the chorus isn’t full of a lot of his probably copyrighted screams/adlibs. Full of strings and horns that make you feel like you’re gliding, this has one of the softest grooves of the rate, and it works for it. There’s so many little parts of this song that are amazing: anytime he says “girrlll…,” when it picks up for the first time and goes “when you Feel That Beat,” the bridge, anything the backing vocals say, etc. Can you believe this was almost a Karen Carpenter song??? 

**Covering the Covers:** Internet comedy band Ninja Sex Party made a cover for their album “Under the Covers.” [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8449ZUh5Ois) is close to the original, with a less smooth vocals, of course. Danny Sexbang is no Michael Jackson.

**bespectacIed** (10): whew mj was a religion truly

**ReallyCreative** (9.6): the chords on the backing vocals are just perfect

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**benjamin\_boo** (9): Love a mid-tempo moment.

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): Quincy Jones is an absolute genius. This song is the very definition of smooth.

**Roxieloxie** (9): I would like to go back to 2011 playing micheal jackson the experience on my wii with my family

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): Giiiiiiiiiirl

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): bleh song but one of his best vocal performances

**steelstepladder** (8): He's done better but theres still a baseline level of quality when it comes to this era of Michael

#I hate rock music so

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Let’s be honest, [Janet’s “Rock With U”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7Qc_VMKmk) is better

**jd1z** (6): people love this song and I do not

**CarlieScion** (5): men

Maxine Nightingale QUEEN of tiktok! A song about a woman who can tell her relationship with her man is failing and she just wants to go back to the first days of the relationship. She wants to get right back where they started from. This song is just happiness bottled up. It’s about a troubled relationship but it just makes you want to burst out in a choreographed dance number, or stare at people, depending on what kind of tiktok you want to make. Also, the wikipedia page for this song calls it disco so that’s good enough for me to feel ok allowing it in the rate. 

**Covering the Covers:** UK pop girl Sinatta has an 80s cover of this song from 1989. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2RXgHfqYx0) is in the twilight zone of covers. It feels like they tried to remake the original but with slightly more advanced technology, and a sax solo!

---

#and it's aaalright!

**TiltControls** (11): I was dead set on giving my 11 to either Don't Leave Me This Way or I'm Coming Out when the rate was first annouced, but this track outshines them all. A classic feel-good song that never fails to put me in a good mood! (btw if people haven't - go listen to the rerecorded/remastered version. This one is still great, but the other is so so much better!)

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this is kinda [NOT DISCO] so i wouldn't have been upset to see it excluded from the rate. however it is also one of the catchiest and most wholesome songs of all time and still feels fresh today so i must give it my 11

**bespectacIed** (10): Gorgeous bop. The strings are very soothing

**conceptualromance** (10): This one just makes me smile

**ManofOranges** (10): Part of this score is purely for nostalgia. The 2005 version of Yours, Mine, and Ours had this song in it and that movie is unironically a favorite of mine, it had such an important impact on my life I couldn't imagine my life without it.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this made me remember 'an extremely goofy movie' lmao. anyway it slaps

**rslashpoopheads** (10): love it

**steelstepladder** (10): Most underrated song in the rate?

**1998tweety** (9.5): big bop

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.6): was gonna give it a 6 until the chorus hit

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): Another surprise in this rate; I’ve heard this before on the soul oldies station in my city, but I’ve never noticed what a catchy and cheerful song it is.

**Mysario** (8.5): the impact of "An Extremely Goofy Movie"

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): My vivid memory of this song is it being played on *Wife Swap* whenever the families would reunite at the end

**wavingwolves** (8): another meme-y song that is hard to rate but still bops hard

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this was definitely a tv show theme song right? Edit: can’t find anything to prove this but it was in an episode of umbrella academy which I just watched so that’s probably it

**bbfan132** (7.5): kind of annoying honestly but still good

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this one has a really fun energy in the chorus

#I want get right back to the start of this rate

**plastichaxan** (6.7): i wish i could take some of these songs more seriously

**MrSwearword** (5): fine but weak against a field of mostly strong and legendary songs

**seanderlust** (4.5): i'm not entirely clear on why this one is on this rate. it doesn't feel very disco/funk to me? idk the history though. it feels like i'm doing it dirty by rating it so low, because it's not a bad song, it's just not nearly as good as most of the other tracks on this list.

**camerinian** (2): I've never heard this song before and I have no idea what it's doing here, it's so much cornier and way less groovy, sounds like it's no one's favourite song from a C-tier Andrew Lloyd Webber show

Is there a better *party* song to exist? Idk probably, but there isn’t a better party song in this rate! This song is legitimately just a party. Just the WOO HOO!’s are enough to get me happy. Forget about the bad times for like 4 minutes, and just celebrate the good ones! Also, reading this on SongFacts.com is really wild “This song was played to help welcome home the 52 freed American hostages from Iran in 1981.” I feel like if I were a hostage, I wouldn’t immediately want to be greeted by any music at all but w/e. 

**Covering the Covers:** Everyone’s favorite Australian export, Kylie Minogue did a cover of this song for her 1992 album. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHMr9prHgn0) is an extremely late 80s sounding cover, but with worse production.

---

#WOO HOO

**1998tweety** (10): iconic massive bop

**bbfan132** (10): a classic, made me feel better on this not so good day

**bespectacIed** (10): literally a song that will never die. As long the human emotion of joy exists, this will be played by someone somewhere

**J\_Toe** (10): one of those songs I've heard all the time without knowing the origin! Cool!

**jsonphile** (10): the most overplayed songs on cruises, but a total bop

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): No wedding, birthday or bat mitzvah would be complete without this song.

**Kirby31200** (10): Becoming the default for celebrating is a huge feat

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a celebration!!!!!! This song persists in my mind for just like two lines out of the whole song, and I think that just speaks to its greatness.

**MrSwearword** (10): oh goddamnit one of the Do Not Playlist songs at weddings...I have no choice but to give it full marks, do I...

**Roxieloxie** (10): we love the other iconic black birthday anthem!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): invented the bee gees

**vayyiqra** (10): [Voice of Al Gore on The Simpsons] [I will.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roRQ2mNwMMQ)

**wavingwolves** (10): there's no good times to celebrate atm but this still made several points

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): I'm a sucker for songs about everyone coming together to dance, no matter who they are as long as they're not racist or sexist or homophobic!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): insert tik tok of girl dancing while crying - me listening to this song in 2020

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): "What’s your pleasure" omg I can't believe they were inspired by queen Jessie Ware here!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I actually don’t like this song but I can’t give it a bad score because they really #didthat with that “woo-hoo!”

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this is the song that plays while the credits roll out and you’re leaving the cinema with your family

**TiltControls** (8.5): it's such a classic, but I've heard it in commercials and things so many times it's hard to identify anything great about it

**conceptualromance** (8): it’s certainly celebratory

**Hielord** (6.8): I like how literal this song is

#BOO HOO

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's just not that interesting, especially compared to Get Down On It

**seanderlust** (6.4): I like this but they have also played this song at literally every function I've been to where the median age is over 50 (corporate holiday parties, aunt's birthdays, etc)

**CarlieScion** (6): it's really not that great

**Mysario** (6): a 10 of a song that reminds me of the Patriots winning the Superbowl but a 2 for how annoying it is to play on Rock Band

**skargardin** (6): iconic party song!! ~~but even so it's a  bit basic~~

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): I can imagine this was pretty uplifting and fun once upon a time, but now when I listen to it I just picture it being used in a very corporate, lifeless manner that feels out of touch and weirdly low-energy, so I can't really enjoy it :(

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): meh

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): i have traumatic memories associated with this song as my principal would play this at the end of every school assembly when i was a kid and i still remember how much i was fuming when my well deserved “star of the week” award was stolen from me by timothy, who constantly flopped in class and called me ugly at my school prom. fuck timothy. anyway it’s not a bad song but i still experience that same kind of visceral anger whenever i hear it

**steelstepladder** (4): Overplay at extremely white functions has effectively killed this one for me

**WillamThunderfuck** (4): This song is ruined for me because of how often this is played at lame ass school parties

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): it's just so played out at this point and they have better songs

Listen, the fact that this song barely made the year end of 1979 is a crime! This is probably one of my favorite songs in the rate. There’s just something about the rolling melody and Diana’s upbeat energy that’s one of the most infectious songs of the rate. I don’t have much to say, I’m just in love with this song. She is THE Boss! 

**Covering the Covers:** The Braxtons, featuring Toni, Tamar, and others, made their own version of the song in 1997. [Their cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33JxH-z8IIc) removes a lot of the fun instrumental motifs and stings that really help punctuate the original, so I’d call it a step down from the original definitely.

---

#It was so right (so right)

**1998tweety** (10): this is excellence

**bbfan132** (10): probably the weakest of her 4 songs here but it’s still a 10 - this one is simply a very strong disco track that i enjoy a lot

**bespectacIed** (10): very euphoric. Diana on the cover is so sexy

**however24** (10): My second choice for 11

**ManofOranges** (10): This is yet another song in the rate that I'd heard but didn't actually know the name of. Now I do! And, needless to say, I love it.

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): a fun, almost cinematic bop, everything is just wrapped together really well

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): If it was used as a lip sync song on RuPaul’s Drag Race it’s probably a bop. I find the “I thought I knew it all, but I didn’t know love!” storyline of this song to be really cute, it makes surrendering control sound fun without insulting her integrity as a person. Also, another example of the power of a disco cover!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): This is a bop

**JunkyGS** (8.5): This is the sample in Replay by Lady Gaga

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): love those horns

**benjamin\_boo** (7): It’s very good, but when compared to the rest of Ms.Ross’s tracks on the list, it’s not as strong.

**skargardin** (7): queen

#I defy this song

**steelstepladder** (7): Another solid track but doesn't stand out too much on its own

**CarlieScion** (6): not ha best

**wavingwolves** (6): not her best, that's all i'm going to say

**MrSwearword** (5): I have no use for this song as a LSFYL (especially when the theme was 70s/disco and they used Diana over Donna which is CHOICES) but The Braxtons and Kristine W made better versions anyway.

One of the biggest songs of all time according to Billboard, Upside Down is somewhat underwhelming. I feel like this song is more of a vibe, and just a song to groove to. But the groove feels difficult to dance to? Like the outro when it just focuses on the guitar is kinda ehhh. It’s not a bad song, but THIS is one of the biggest songs of all time? 

**Covering the Covers:** Well, hello again Collette. I really did not expect to mention you, really ever again in my lifetime. But yes, two years after her cover of Ring My Bell, she’s back with [a cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRklELMj5is) of Upside Down. Another way too busy cover that does nothing interesting besides making noise.

#Gave this a 10 instinctively

**bbfan132** (10): everything comes together perfectly here, the lyrics work well with the instrumental too

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): What a GROOVE. The lyrical content is somewhat dubious to me, but I can't not love this.

**nootnoot781** (10): imagine being TWENTY ONE years into your career and releasing perfection. iconic

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is my favorite Diana Ross song in this lineup

**skargardin** (10): we love a smash hit!

**ReallyCreative** (9.6): name someone else who could pull off the word "thee" in a song like this, quickly

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): Such a marvelously groovy song, elevated by Ross’ cheeky wink-and-a-smile delivery.

**steelstepladder** (9): 80's Donna is still great

**wavingwolves** (8.5): upside down... just like the playlist and the scores list for this rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like this song but something about it has always felt… off? to me? It’s just kind of disjointed, it feels like the pieces aren’t put together quite right and they fall over each other in a bit of an awkward way that’s kind of unsettling. Like the chorus feels copy and pasted in and the backing feels slightly out of sync with the vocals. Love the chorus though.

#upside down thumbs

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is her worst song in the rate but it's still decent

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this is good but kinda underwhelming for a song on the billboard GOAT list

**ManofOranges** (7): This one sounds pretty good.

**MrSwearword** (7): fine for what it is, but can you believe this is from the same album as I'M COMING OUT and somehow went to #1 where I'm Coming Out went to #5 on the Hot 100? iCannot

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I can't in good conscience give a disco song less than a 7.

**vayyiqra** (7): Wasn't this in some rate before because I remember it from somewhere.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): kind of boring

**bespectacIed** (5): kinda boring

**RandomHypnotica** (5): I kept waiting for this song to really kick off and it… didn't

Did y’all have this song play at elementary school anti-bullying assemblies as well, or was that just me? Recorded in one-take and with the lead singer being fed her lines through headphones for a “spontaneous feel,” is an anthem of togetherness. We! Are! Family! While I wouldn’t say its better than He’s The Greatest Dancer, their other #2 hit, it’s definitely been more iconic and stood the test of time better. Also, please read this from songfacts.com: “In 2001, Nile Rodgers produced a new version of this song featuring Britney Spears, Steven Tyler, 'N Sync, Run-D.M.C., Busta Rhymes, Kevin Bacon, Joan Rivers and Vanessa Williams along with Sister Sledge. Proceeds went to help families of victims of the terrorist attacks on America. Spike Lee shot the video for the new version.” whew. 

**Covering the Covers:** Punk rock girls Babes in Toyland decided to be a little more pop with their own version. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKe09YxN8k) sounds like a punk rock cover that honestly is better than I expected but still not good. Also, this music video gives me kinda The Upside Down Show vibes.

#I got all my sistahs with me

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**bbfan132** (10): i have nothing to say about this other than “it’s a 10”

**bespectacIed** (10): The G in LGBTQ+ community after being singled out by the rest of the community for their racism/bigotry be like:

**CarlieScion** (10): IVE GOT ALL MY SISTERS WITH ME

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): There is a utopian sense of jubilance to this track, a theme of family (chosen or otherwise) which really resonates the ideals of the disco era - people joined together regardless of race, sexuality, gender or class, all united by a shared love of music, dance and nightlife culture.

**ManofOranges** (10): This one's a 10 for all the versions of this song that we would all sing at school.

**MrSwearword** (10): a legendary classic

**rslashpoopheads** (10): sister sledge ate

**ignitethephoenix** (9): one of the more iconic songs from this era

**seanderlust** (9): aw this is fun! I apologize for every time I was at an event and this song started playing and I spaced out

**waluigiest** (9): black excellence that’s what this is

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): This is the intro of a popular end-of-year radio show in the Netherland which is why I associate this song with the cosy feeling of Christmas :)

**conceptualromance** (8): another song done dirty by advertising

**vayyiqra** (8): classic

#My family voted for trump

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): too corny :(

**TiltControls** (7.2): I'm not usually one to consider overplay when liking a song, but there are some classic tracks that are just used in every commercial or trailer or whatever that it's hard to take them seriously as actual songs

**rickikardashian** (7): every movie starring eddie morphy

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Sister Sledge have better songs than this, listen to this album because there’s some great cuts on it.

**skargardin** (5): I literally just heard this but I couldn't tell you what it sounds like SJFGJ

**steelstepladder** (5): This might be controversial but after you hear that chorus once you really don't need to listen to the rest of the song

**wavingwolves** (4): yeah yeah this is a classic but does it spark joy? it doesn't

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): this song makes me irrationally angry.

A song that I’m really shocked at how high it is placed, Don’t Leave Me This Way is another song headlined by a great vocalist. Building and building on it’s swell and bombass, this song feels bigger and bigger by the second. Thelma does NOT want you to leave without satisfying her (with some s3x). Just the moment when the “awwwwww……. BABY!” hits and you are just transported. What an great song. 

**Covering the Covers:** Surprise bitch, THIS is a cover. The original is by [Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIkcB8GObo). This whole song is honestly really good?? It’s got real textured vocals, especially for a disco song, but it’s still got great backing vocals and its still a groovy song. I would recommend this to anyone who liked the cover in the rate.

#My heart is full of love

**bbfan132** (10): totally captivating song, you can hear the passion in her voice and the chorus is a much-needed release that is perfect for dancing your heart out

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic

**ManofOranges** (10): Whew now this one's a hit.

**MrSwearword** (10): justice for this song because that goddamned LSFYL with Mimi Imfurst and India Ferrah...gurl...LOOK OVER THERE

This song is so jiggy! He’s The Greatest Dancer is about, well, the greatest dancer. It’s really about a man who can get anyone he wants at the disco because he’s the best dancer, which is actually was a way that men at that disco brought people (note the intentional gender neutral language) home to fuck. The guitars on this song are just so good. Plus, when you get to that “oh what, ✨✨wow!✨✨” hook, it just feels so happy and you think that this guy in the song truly must be the greatest dancer. While it was rumored that this song was inspired by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, Nile Rodgers revealed in a recent interview that the song is actually about [this icon](https://media.tenor.com/images/614646f36904c452c6daa55faa3738c5/tenor.gif). Quite the scandal! 

**Covering the Covers:** Sister of Kylie, Danii Minogue made her own version of the song. [Her song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeE0oi84YAQ) is honestly the definition of overproduced. Like, calm tf down.

#Kylie Minogue - WOW!

**bbfan132** (10): stan sister sledge and stan tatianna

**however24** (10): That riff

**ManofOranges** (10): You want to talk about a sexy, alluring, enchanting song? Well, you've got one right here. This song has got a point; this song's an icon; this song's a legend; and this song is the moment, now come on now. It's just so damn good. Listen to that guitar!!!!

**seanderlust** (10): I love the way she pronounces "my creme de la creme". IDK who Halston and Fiorucci are but i'm sure they're happy to be involved.

**skargardin** (10): y'all better not rob this gay anthem

**1998tweety** (9): big bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): UwU wut’s this? OwO wow! he’s the gweatest dancer~

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): I don’t know who this mysterious dancing gentleman is but damn if this song doesn’t make me want to meet him.

JustinJSrisuk: u/seanderlust Halston was an incredibly influential designer of modern, sleek and chic American sportswear who was most prominent in the 1970s. His slinky sequined gowns were on all the brightest lights of the Studio 54 scene such as Bianca Jagger, Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand and the Warhol Factory. He was a trailblazer of a kind of mass branding and licensing that all fashion brands take after till this very day. he tragically died of AIDS in 1990, one of an entire generation of LGBTQ+ artists and luminaries taken by the epidemic. There was a great [documentary](https://youtu.be/pG499lzVjBE) about his life that came out recently. 
  
Fiorucci was a highly popular 1970s fashion label from Italy that specialized in jeans; later maximalist Italian design houses such as Dolce & Gabbana and Versace owe a lot to their aesthetic and business model.

This is definitely one of my favorite songs of all time. I was really fully prepared to give Last Dance my 11, and had it there until literally the day i’m writing this (august 31st) and I was here to write about this song and I just realized I love it too much to not give it my 11. I mean, there’s so much to love about this song: the energy, the happiness, the vocals, the production, the fucking sYNTHS AHHHH!!!!!! Its all so SO good. I just could gush about this song for so much. I’ve never wanted to dance to a song more in my fucking LIFE UGH!!!!!!!! Also, Bob fucking SLAYED that lip sync. 

**Covering the Covers:** Wow, another person from the UK covering a disco classic? I’m shocked. Jimmy Somerville made a cover. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZtdcMIR5do) is honestly a fever dream. I originally thought i would hate it because Jimmy looks like a real straight white nerd (aka the last person that should make a disco cover), but it’s just so weird and funny and camp and its incredible. Like Jimmy does half the macarena like 6 times and the macarena wasn’t even out yet. All the bad green screen and the space theme and silvery cowboy and the terrible dancing and the gian space head, it’s all CAMP and I love it.

#You make me feel like a mighty real woman

**bbfan132** (10): i thought this was kind of boring at one point but yeah this is awesome - an iconic gay anthem!

**benjamin\_boo** (10): Forever iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic LGBTQ icon AND anthem. Animal Collective won't have a career without this tbh. Bob devoured Derrick in this lip sync

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Are my scores for songs that appeared on Drag Race inflated? No.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Y’all kids need to respect Sylvester more, he’s been weirdly forgotten by mainstream culture (this song has never ONCE popped up on the disco Pandora stations my work plays) and we need to keep his legacy alive. This song is timeless and exuberant, he leaned more into soul and ‘80s pop as his career went on but he’ll forever been one of the kings of disco for this one.

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Icon. Trailblazer.

**MrSwearword** (10): now this is GAY disco and shoutout to The Weather Girls back when they were Two Tons Of Fun doing backup vocals for Sylvester.

**skargardin** (10): iconic

Like what the fuck even is this song? A disco version of the tale of a russian guy who people tried to assassinate him many times yet all the ladies wanted to fuck him? Not to mention, his GRANDDAUGHTER was still alive when this was a hit so there’s a legit chance that she heard this song about her unkillable grandpa who also fucks a lot, which sends me. Also, it is now impossible to mention this song without it’s iconic af [Just Dance 2 Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DcGBE-F9hk). The video has 6 MILLION views!!!! Plus, the russian guy made multiple appearances in other songs since then, including [YMCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCDCwuGcEmA) and [Sugar by Maroon 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT0HnIg8f90).  I con ic. 

**Covering the Covers:** Idk why a totally separate rock group also decided to cover Boney M. but here we have Turisas’ cover of Rasputin. [Their cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkBs0VCSX0) is a lot faster and more metal than the Daddy Cool cover discussed earlier. The most impressive thing about this song is that it’s official music video was uploaded in 2007. Please don’t listen to this.

#Ra ra ah ah ah ro ma ro ma ma ga ga ooh la la

**camerinian** (11): this song is so fucking dumb I adore it. It's everything I want in my disco, airtight bassline, iconic core melody, galloping bouncy drums, God-tier sing-along hook, and just the stupidest possible lyrical conceit that somehow works wonders and teaches you about history at the same time. It's classic in its protagonist's tale but modern in the hedonism and now I'm thinking about it way more than they did, just fuck off if you don't love everything about this

**purplechilipepper** (11): I know I have to explain this but like it's fucking Rasputin it just slaps me into another dimentsion

**steelstepladder** (11): In the dark of the night is the best song from Anestasia

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**J\_Toe** (10): didn't realise this song was this old

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm just obsessed with this song, I really am.

**MrSwearword** (10): who else but a group in the 70s could make a song about a Russian mystic who basically fucked up the Romanov dynasty

**Mysario** (10): my friends and I used to do a thing called Tuesday 20 where we would throw in $20 into a poker home game and play and this song always kicked off the night and that was always a great time until the downstairs neighbours got the entire house on fire, now that was a game that really was gone

**pat-rickstar** (10): The Just Dance 2 dance to this used to be my go to and it's just associated with good memories, so it’s a 10 from me

**plastichaxan** (10): timeless classic i still know the just dance choreo

**sandyfishnets** (10): clap clap

**seanderlust** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cnPdjQOWxg&ab_channel=NatassiaHarris

**wavingwolves** (10): dancing to this on just dance is basically my sole quarantine workout

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): Absolutely iconic, catchy, unique, incredible, just an all-time greatest song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.1): kudos to boney m for teaching several generations of children history

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): Moskau stans get some taste

**NotWith10000Men** (9): ….i never knew this was a legit song…. my life will never be the same

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): oh so this is where that meme comes from

**waluigiest** (9): I didn’t realize this was actually a good song lmao

**Hielord** (8.8): I'm feeling like using a tracksuit

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): wait so is this song about that guy from american horror story apocalypse or that wii dancing video game

**bbfan132** (8): fun but i wish the rest of the song was as good as the intro

**conceptualromance** (7.5): This song is creepy, just like the actual Rasputin

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): I have seen the lyrics of this song over tumblr but never known the source and now that i do, i dont know how i feel about this monsterfucker anthem

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): it's different but it's not necessarily great

#the Anastasia soundtrack >>>

**jsonphile** (7): as far as joke songs go, this is a bop

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): But this song deserves a 10/10 for the sheer audacity of being a disco song about a late-19th Century mystic and courtier of imperial Russia replete with hopak “hey hey hey”s.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I've never heard this song in my life but everyone knows Ra Ra Rasputin

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This isn’t necessarily a bad song but if you get too into it at a party it tells me something about who you are

**loloeffeff** (6): ugh I just can't get into this one...

**skargardin** (5): meh

**CarlieScion** (4): how is this so bad when daddy cool is so great?

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): As if I needed any more reasons to be ashamed of being Russian.

**vayyiqra** (0): I'm so tired of this damn song. It's dumb, it's cheesy in a bad way (disco is supposed to be cheesy in a good way), and Rasputin was a shitty guy anyway. Fuck this song. (I'm not mad though.)

Surprisingly, Kool And The Gang’s biggest song on spotify, Get Down On It is one of the most recent songs in this rate. However, I feel as if it’s one that has the least personality. Like, i put it on twice while I was writing it and each time it ended I was like “oh right.” Like, it’s not a good thing for a song that I’m more enamored by I’m Yours by Jason Mraz playing right after the “funky” disco song. 

**Covering the Covers:** UK boyband Blue (in case you haven’t noticed, there’s a lot of UK boybands here) had a cover here with Lil Kim. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9z9mujofcg) it’s not as bad as it sounds but it’s definitely a lot less funky and fun.

#Getting down to this song

**bbfan132** (10): five million times better than ride wit me… every part of this is infectious as hell

**benjamin\_boo** (10): Put me in the Soul Train line with this track whew.

**bespectacIed** (10): legend

**camerinian** (10): almost gave this my proxy 11 as a write-in vote for Jungle Boogie

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): The best dance songs don’t just ask you to dance, they COMMAND IT, and this is one of those perfect dance tracks that utterly demands that you get your ass up off the wall to boogie.

**ManofOranges** (10): I really do love this one. For some reason, in my head, I had always the melody to this song mixed up with "Jungle Boogie," which I don't like as much, so I was kinda surprised when it didn't sound like that, but in a good way.

**MrSwearword** (10): another enduring classic but doesn't suffer from the Do Not Playlist status of its sister song here.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song is a cookout bop and i love it both because nostalgia and also funky synth

**Roxieloxie** (10): feel like pure shit just wanna be at a black family function jamming to all the oldies bops

**rslashpoopheads** (10): invented the bee gees

**vayyiqra** (10): Lowkey might be even better than Celebration despite not being as well-known.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.6): think this slightly better than celebration

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): Luma key: no substitute for chroma key

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): Bring back soul train NOW

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**wavingwolves** (8): ugh this is so fun

**seanderlust** (7.4): okay I actually really like this one

Based on a real place in Westlake Los Angeles, MacArthur Park is probably one of the most famous covers in this rate. Originally by [Richard Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwYQgk05DY), MacArthur Park was the first #1 for Donna Summer. MacArthur Park has some of the weirdest lyrics in a pop song^^^^cover of all time. What’s the cake? Where’s the recipe? Why are the pants striped? Are the old men playing chinese checkers or regular checkers? In short, it’s a metaphor for the end of a relationship on the chorus, and the verses are a look at the good times in the relationship and how they were too naive to notice the end coming. This song is so interesting lyrically and the change in emotions and production is great. Too bad people couldn’t decide whether or not they loved or hated this song! 

**Covering the Covers:** As most of us probably know, MacArthur Park is a cover of a song by Richard Harris. [The original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwYQgk05DY) is definitely an interesting listen, full of baroque pop elements, orchestral moments, and Harris’ interesting vocal stylings, and all that happens before the change on the bridge. When that happens, and the horns and piano really shine, it really feels like a trip. It’s not better than Donna’s but it’s definitely interesting and I think everyone should listen to it at least once.

#Sweet Tooth

**MrSwearword** (11): DONNA'S BEST SONG and responsible for the best LSFYL in Drag Race herstory.

**ReallyCreative** (11): I'm giving this the 11 because the full 19 minute suite version is one of the best pieces of music ever made. The absolute melodrama that Donna is able to convey on a song about a cake melting in the rain in a park. Lorde found drinking the same drinks in a different bar.

**rslashpoopheads** (11): the way this song

**seanderlust** (11): i gave out a lot of 10s in this rate, and there were six (!) potential 11s, but this song won out. it's melodramatic, it's world-building, it's batshit...this is disco's "Hallowed Be Thy Name."

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, Manila ate this UP

**bbfan132** (10): the most extra song ever and i love every second of it

**bespectacIed** (10): "Someone left my cake out in the rain / And I don't think that I can take it / 'Cause it took so long to bake it / And I'll never have that recipe again" if that isn't some of the most genius lyrics ever done. Also, Manila Luzon period

**cremeebrulee** (10): these lyrics are so ridiculous but also really endearing? idk i just really love it lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): living proof that if a song is a hard enough bop it doesn’t matter if it’s nonsense

**jd1z** (10): donna is everything.

**ManofOranges** (10): A song that literally doesn't make any sense, and proves that it doesn't matter if a song makes sense as long as it sounds real good.

**rickikardashian** (10): we could have rated the full version and my score still wouldn't have changed

**skargardin** (10): and i'll never have that recipe AGAAAAAAAAAAAAIN

**waluigiest** (10): I think of this song every time I stop at the Macarthur BART station

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the second best donna summer song in this rate. yes, it is!

**slimboyfriend** (9.7): THESE lyrics about a relationship that's actually a cake that's actually a park with that disco breakdown?? That's camp.

**TiltControls** (9.7): as much as I love the song, i still have very little understanding what it's about

**conceptualromance** (9.5): Donna Summer’s delivery of this song is what really makes it

**ignitethephoenix** (9): love it when the beat kicks in

**NotWith10000Men** (9): …she's singing about a cake…? I think I stan?

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): The lyrics are just a bit too odd for me

**Hielord** (7.5): What a key change, my GOD

#Left out in the rain

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): Sorry I absolutely CANNOT take this song seriously, like, the whole cake metaphor is just weird and hilarious to hear. Like, why did this person leave the cake out in the rain? What happened to the recipe that you'll never have it again? Were you following it off of a TV program that wasn't airing again and you didn't think to write it down or something? So confusing

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): This rate has made me realize that I’m just not a Donna Summer fan. There’s something in the timbre of her voice that doesn’t seem to hook me for whatever reason.

**camerinian** (6): lmao imagine writing these lyrics for them to be a serious ballad, like what's wrong with you. Slightly better as a disco banger tho

**CarlieScion** (6): why did yall hype this up so much

**jsonphile** (6): While far better than the original, no amount of disco groove can fully make up for the bizarrely stupid lyrics. Anyway stream Jurassic Park by Weird Al

**Kirby31200** (5): I too have cried over ruined baked goods

**Mysario** (5): rate the 10 minute version you cowards

**steelstepladder** (2): Worst Donna Summer song here by a mile. It's a stupid stupid stupid concept to soulfully lament a damn cake. And yes I understand the metaphor and why it is the way it is but it still sounds stupid when it hits your ear. It's like the mattress stealing line from Closer but for the entire song, AND without the accidental genius of closer to make it work. Donna Summer, shes no Drew Taggart

**vayyiqra** (2): This is embarrassingly bad. The original song is unironically great, and this is like a bad parody of it. It has some okay instrumental parts, but mostly it's unbearable. Someone lost the recipe for the cake.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): the combination of the overly theatrical vocals, lack of a good hook, and odd cake metaphors makes me not like this song even though i feel like i should

Opening with an iconic synthesized vocal hook, it should come as no surprise that Let’s Groove is groovy af. Full of falsettos and a good blend of live instrumentation and synthesizers, this really helps transition EW&F into the 80s. 

**Covering the Covers:** In 2014, BBC2 made a whole album of 80s covers, with Let’s Groove being covered by UK pop boy Olly Murs. [His cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0zI5PUgdf8) really doesn’t change anything about the original. It nearly sounds like it’s just the instrumental with him singing over it. Noah Fence to Olly but i would absolutely take Earth, Wind and Fire’s vocals over his.

#I'm groovin'

**bespectacIed** (10): Most life affirming song of all time. Daft Punk's career would be dust without this song. Also I just realized SNSD - All Night plagiarized this omfg

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Deliriously joyful.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song has just got such a groove to it, there's a reason why they named it "Let's Groove." I've just got such a strong for this one, too.

**Mysario** (9.1): why are some songs just done better than others even though they all share the same message and all sound the same?

The Emotions lowkey served the best vocals in this rate. There’s a reason their “OHH!” was sampled in so many rap songs. Since I didn’t put The Emotions as a part of Boogie Wonderland, it makes sense that I didn’t put Earth, Wind, & Fire here! EWF actually do a lot of the instrumentation on this. Fun Fact: Mariah Carey and C + C Music Factory were sued because of the similarities between this and the Mariah song *Emotions*, which the fact that the song is also named after the group they think they stole from is just too funny.  

**Covering the Covers:** Marcia Hines is an australian singer who was voted “Queen of Pop” from 1976-1979 by TV Week viewers. Has anyone else in this rate done that OR covered The Emotions? No! [Her 2006 cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAyGeDQXHck) is ok, and then you get to the OH! in the chorus and wow what a downgrade.

---

#Oh, Woah!

**JustinJSrisuk** (11): When I think about the music that I gravitate towards the most, from disco, funk, Motown and Philly soul to PC Music, I’ve come to realize that the commonality that I’m most drawn to in these genres is how they seem to be the ones most able to distill pure, uncut joy, optimism and ebullience in sonic form. This song totally encapsulates the idea of “sonic joy” in a nutshell. There’s just something magical about the harmony between the sisters’s (yes, The Emotions consist of sisters!) voices that radiate sunshine and rainbows, and as the song crescendos blissfully upwards as it goes on it becomes what I can only describe as a musical dopamine rush. Sure, songs with weighty, “important” themes are more written and discussed about, but sometimes you just need a song that’s simply about how wonderful it feels to be alive and in love - especially in the current day waking  nightmarescape that we are forced to inhabit. Fun fact: before they were known as The Emotions, the Hutchinson sisters went by the group name “The Heavenly Sunbeams”, a fitting title if you ask me. Fun fact two, this song was written, produced and performed on by members of another band in this rate: Earth, Wind and Fire!

**1998tweety** (10): legendaric

**bbfan132** (10): i love this but i always think of eureka when i hear this, unfortunately…

**bespectacIed** (10): What a massive slay holy shit. I forgot how much this reminds me of Got to Be Real omg (both some of the best songs of all time). Soul + disco truly are the milk + honey of music genres

**letsallpoo** (10): kalorie is fucking dead

**ManofOranges** (10): Can't help but dance along to this one.

**MrSwearword** (10): Eureka O'Hara might have had a questionable run on the show, but she served in the LSFYL to this song.

**Roxieloxie** (10): i keep making jokes about black family functions but these songs really make me feel like im about to get roped into a game of uno at the kids table

**seanderlust** (10): i'm gonna be clear - the only reason this isn't in the running for my 11 is that i'm not sold it belongs in this rate. but this is a fantastic song

**camerinian** (9): This is the closest any song in the rate got to classic Motown and I am so here for it

**J\_Toe** (9): again, didn't realise how old this song was as its used all the time in a supermarket ad where I live

**rslashpoopheads** (8): it's like the bee gees on 1.5x speed

#I get so emotional baby

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this sounds like another song. edit: oh yeah Mariah totally sampled / was inspired by this in the song Emotions

**wavingwolves** (7): the vocal runs are rly good and keep the song interesting

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Good but I don't find myself going back to it that often tbh

I’ll be honest, I’m probably the most surprised with how high this song is than any other song in the rate. I’m not saying this is a bad song at all, but it’s just surprising. Originally, this only hit #53 in the charts, but thanks to the massive success of Saturday Night Fever, this song got a rerelease and it managed to hit #11. Now used whenever someone needs to burn something happily in a tv show, it was also used in the Disco Demolition Night that had people burn disco records before a baseball game that led to a huge riot that signified the end of the disco era for the US. 

**Covering the Covers:** Tina Turner is a queen. Period. [That being said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJa7Z-Tfpyk), I do feel like her cover includes a whole lot of oversinging, especially on the verses.

#Hunka Hunka burnin love

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE BOP

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): A song that is so hot - Arizona summer hot, gender reveal announcing party hot. It’s like it activates your amygdala, you can’t help but fan yourself after listening to it.

**ManofOranges** (10): BURN BABY BURN SHAWTY FIRE BURNING ON THE DANCEFLOOR

**MrSwearword** (10): an enduring classic

**seanderlust** (10): Imagine if someone came out with a four minute song that just lyrically riffed on the metaphor "this song is lit." Fire.

**wavingwolves** (10): the way this is one of the greatest songs ever made ever... yes

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I remember one of the NCAA basketball games I played as a kid had a band rendition of this song that absolutely slapped

**ignitethephoenix** (9): bop although I prefer Amber Riley’s cover on Glee slightly more (the only person who can cover this song well)

**rslashpoopheads** (9): starting to feel like we're rating the shrek series soundtrack

**steelstepladder** (9): It makes such good use of it's strings I love it

**bbfan132** (8.5): a classic but a bit too straightforward and short for me

**Mysario** (8.2): a little too on the nose but it works

#burn baby burn

**camerinian** (7): It’s only now I’m realising how many of these songs have been ruined for mentally by being associated with Shrek

**vayyiqra** (7): It's dumb but it is a bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): It sounds like someone is punching him in the balls as he sings, but it’s fun to sing along to at least.

Ahhhhhhhh FUCK OFF! This song was originally gonna say “fuck off” instead of “freak out” and honestly, that’s the energy I’m looking for. That would’ve been iconic as fuck, but they probably wouldn’t have sold **12 million singles** if they said fuck right in the hook. Also, this was the first song to return to #1 twice after being taken off the top spot for the first time. Chart record breaking icons! Anyways, this song is iconic and got a great guitar hook to go through the song, not to mention the aforementioned “aaahhhh freak out!” 

**Covering the Covers:** Hey, let’s bring up Glee again. They used Le Freak in the 2nd episode of the whole show. This cover [may only be 30 seconds long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWlIawrs7gk) but i’m just including it because of this line from the official glee wikia. “The Glee kids disapprove of the song with Kurt deeming it "really gay." Mr. Schuester, however, won't let them change the song as he misguidedly believes that everyone still likes disco.“ Whew, we don’t have time to unpack all of that.

#ahhhh freak out!

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**bbfan132** (10): glee really introduced me to this… thanks i guess

**bespectacIed** (10): gay

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Le Gendary.

**J\_Toe** (10): Honestly, awarding the 11 of the rate is so hard because there are so many deserving it! I want Your Love could have been included and got an 11 too!

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): The thing I most love about CHIC’s catalog of music from the disco era is that they really exemplify the sophisticated coolness of the disco divas and studs that ruled the late ‘70s. One can’t help but feel like a million bucks whilst blasting CHIC.

**ManofOranges** (10): I don't speak French but I can if you like when this song comes on.

**MrSwearword** (10): Nile Rodgers is a God, especially when you realize this song was created as a response by being turned away at Studio 54.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this is what a disco song should be

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): The first bassline ever written

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): banger

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): FREAK OUT!!!!!

**Kirby31200** (9): How do you properly rate a decades-long soundtrack meme?

**loloeffeff** (9): imagine how much more iconic this would have been if they have kept the lyrics as "fuck off" instead of "freak out" lmao

**steelstepladder** (9): Freakazoid approves

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): When I was a kid, I thought this song was that "Africa" song all the adults seemed to talk about, because I thought they were singing "Aaaaafrica!" instead of "Ah, Freak Out" 💀

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Outside the chorus this song is just okay

**rslashpoopheads** (8): actually iconic

**skargardin** (8): the le freak, c'est Chic line is a moment in herstory

**vayyiqra** (8): https://rulefortytwo.com/secret-rock-knowledge/chapter-3/le-freak/ based

#ehh fuck off

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): There’s some great parts here but it’s another disco song where the parts are greater than the whole. The first verse is just kind of awkward and expository when compared to the others and the dance break is too repetitive.

**CarlieScion** (5): my introduction to this song was sadly that glee episode so

**wavingwolves** (5): this is such a end of wedding party song and don't know if i love it or hate it

**patcheso8** (1): this is another song I hate. It's in EVERY kids' movie where the characters are dancing and it's just so cheesy and I hate it
