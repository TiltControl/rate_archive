This song was a NUMBER 2 HIT while only consisting of 6 words and being just awful. Just everything about the song is enough to bore me. I care so little about this that I legitimately misspelled their name for the rate and only realized it when someone pointed it out 2 weeks into it. Idk just watch the [ToddInTheShadows section](https://youtu.be/l7LmTSrfpRQ?t=728) where he drags the song funnier than I ever could. 

**Covering the Covers:** There is like, no one who ever covered this song. So, here’s a much better song by a little boy named Freddie James also called [Get Up and Boogie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYywdZvG6XY). Like, aside from the fact that he is a child, this is a mfing bop. Wow!

#Get Up 10

**bespectacIed** (10): https://twitter.com/findurmeme/status/1270793627275366400?s=19

**CarlieScion** (9): okay I WILL

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**cremeebrulee** (7): around the world by daft punk wishes

**J\_Toe** (7): okay these two silver connection songs are really similar

#No. I don't think I will.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKGrfC1860o

**bbfan132** (6): i honestly forgot to rate this, that’s how boring it was

**ManofOranges** (6): Honestly, this song isn't that bad to me, but it doesn't wow me or anything. The way they just kind of half-heartedly sing "boogie" and note just kind of goes down in pitch is so funny to me.

**Roxieloxie** (6): not the best song in this rate with the word boogie in it

**rslashpoopheads** (6): boring but boogie

**skargardin** (6): this is cute but gets a little bit old by the end of it

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): “music is growing more repetitive” “lyrics don’t mean anything anymore” hmmmmmmm

**slimboyfriend** (5): YAWN

**ignitethephoenix** (4): yeah this is definitely one of the worse songs in the rate as I’ve been warned. Production isn’t bad but this just sounds like a parody

**hikkaru** (3): they sound so bored

**jsonphile** (3): I can't stand the way they say "boogie"

**MrSwearword** (3): it is so subpar and pointless but disco production solves this groups' problems.

**NotWith10000Men** (3): do they say anything else????

**JustinJSrisuk** (2.5): The singers sound so lethargic that they don’t even sound like they have the conviction to tell people to be quiet in a movie theatre, much less demand that people get off their asses and dance.

**wavingwolves** (2): this song makes me feel like i'm in a pugartory... does it ever end?

**Mysario** (1): this is why people hated disco

**camerinian** (0): the video of everyone not dancing to this as these girls drop their Dua Lipa-ass choreo is a all-time cringe classic

**ReallyCreative** (0): one of the worst things to ever come out of this era, it's actually such a trainwreck

**steelstepladder** (0): You're not my mom you can't make me

y’all should’ve seen my fucking face when I found out this was a number one hit….. This is one of the first number ones of disco too. This song has a bit of a groove, but jesus christ the rest of the song is so lifeless. There’s only 6 words in this song and yet there are instrumental #1s that have more to say than this. This feels more like telling someone to take a brisk walk than telling a bird to fly through the air. Some pretty strings save this from being an outright 1/10. It's pretty hilarious that both of their songs are the first ones out.

**Covering the Covers:** First off, no one really cares about this song enough to cover it. Second of all, we have a UK group Bond here covering this song and saying a whole 8 lines. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeTupL6nS_Q) is pretty much what a UK girl group covering this song would sound like. It’s just boring.

---

#Rockin Robin

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Never heard this one before, it’s nice but I wish it had more lyrics.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a cool song but it's basically an instrumental

**wavingwolves** (8): i'm usually such a sucker for violin disco

**CarlieScion** (7): could they not have thought of more lyrics

**MrSwearword** (7): cute but lowkii lost to time unless you weirdly remember the chorus and that doesn't happen often.

**skargardin** (7): cute lil moment

#Bird Flu

**1998tweety** (6.5): kinda drags

**bbfan132** (6.5): this song sounds good but it’s extremely repetitive and there really isn’t that much to it so i can’t give it a higher score :/

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): no clue how anyone under the age of 40, in 1976, could groove to the Silver Connection unironically (i groove to them ironically).

**ManofOranges** (6): This and "Get Up and Boogie" are in the same boat. They're honestly the same song to me. It's pretty much just an instrumental track too, isn't it?

**Mysario** (5.8): this song overstays its welcome, but how can you hate a song that got #1 on the charts singing only 6 unique words? your fave will never

**Hielord** (5.3): It's a nice song, but the Fly, Robin, Fly part feels disconnected from the rest of the song

**bespectacIed** (5): boring

**NotWith10000Men** (5): die robin die

**rslashpoopheads** (4): boring

**camerinian** (2): Can they fly, robin, fly any closer to the mic or

**JustinJSrisuk** (2): I’ll stay grounded, thanks.

**steelstepladder** (1): Love the charitable host for putting in two silver convention songs to take up two day one spots

**ignitethephoenix** (0): easily forgettable and also very boring. It was hard picking my zero between both songs from this group but this one was just more boring

#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8K3W1wPXeA

**vayyiqra** (11): Yes, I am really giving this my 11. I get the sense that's a hot take, and I get that, because this should be an awful, cheesy song by a guy who isn't even a disco artist. I just think it's a well-composed bop (even though parts of it were plagiarized) and it's just tongue in cheek enough for the lyrics to work that it's more of what TV Tropes calls an Affectionate Parody of disco, rather than a mean-spirited one. Idk, I've always liked this song since I was a kid, even though it makes me cringe a bit. I don't even like Rod Stewart that much, but I will defend this. However, I also fully understand hating it. There's a very fine line here.

#I think the song is good

**bespectacIed** (10): This will get clobbered but that synth riff is the definition of iconic

**Hielord** (9.3): YES BABY THIS IS DISCO

**agentofscranton** (9): on a bus ride once this middle aged white woman stepped onto the bus with this blaring out of her headphones on repeat for the entire bus journey. i think about her and her perforated eardrums everyday.

**loloeffeff** (9): honestly... a BOP

**ReallyCreative** (9): I actually really like this and I can see this going out early, it's way different than anything else on the rate but it's a great song that has a lot of cool things going on.

**Mysario** (8.4): the rare exception where the Glee version is vastly superior - also the fact they never used the Glee version instead opting for "Animal" (likely because they the show got paid to do so), relegating this to a random album track for the Warblers. Really?

**bbfan132** (8): why do i actually like this….

**ignitethephoenix** (8): kind of a guilty pleasure song ngl

**rickikardashian** (8): if you’re name is junior and youre really handsome cmon raise your hand

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this could be a lot worse tbh

**wavingwolves** (8): this will be polarizing but it's such a good song

#I don't think the song is good

**rslashpoopheads** (6): honestly I was so confused to see Rod Stewart in a disco rate

**nbapip** (4): if you want to improve your life this is the most important video of rod stewart ever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YlZQN09w-Y

**NotWith10000Men** (4): why does it sound like he has a southern accent when he says sexy

**camerinian** (3): my mum is super into Rod Stewart and I never got why, frog on helium-ass type voice. Trumpet solo kinda slaps tho

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): god i just do not like this song for some reason. i was waiting for it to end the entire time. hoping it gets last place!

**MrSwearword** (1): I never thought I'd say this, but Paris Hilton did this song better.

#Well, since you asked.....

**conceptualromance** (9.5): Rod Stewart is definitely not sexy but this song is pretty great

**Roxieloxie** (7): not really

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): Sorry, Rod, but I don’t. I do love the little instrumental flourish on the outro, though.

**ManofOranges** (6): Nope!

**1998tweety** (5.5): not really

**J\_Toe** (5): no i dont

**letsallpoo** (3): not really

Probably the most forgotten song in this rate, Born To Be Alive is a frantic af bop. It’s just a man singing about how we don’t need to do X, Y, Z to “live our life right” and all we were born to do was be alive and live our lives in our own way. I feel the frantic nature of the song helps it stand out among a lot of other disco songs, focusing more on the message than creating a groove. Also, apparently Madonna went on tour for Patrick Hernandez as a backup dancer, so Patrick was doing charity work <3 

**Covering the Covers:** One hit wonder icons The Weather Girls (known for It’s Raining Men) made a cover for their 2007 album “Muscles, Men, & More,” which sounds like my dreams. [The girls’ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOAZQKFFKx4) is just a normal dance version that is just not good. Wow, who would’ve thought a 2007 Weather Girls’ song would be bad?

---

#Alive and Well

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Oh this kinda goes off.

**JunkyGS** (9): Lana Del Rey is S H A K I N G

**camerinian** (8.5): I love the momentum on this thing

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): the instrumental on this hits

**J\_Toe** (8): have somehow never heard this song before tonight

**rickikardashian** (8): this entire score is based on that guitar

#Born to Die

**1998tweety** (7): Born To Die outsold

**slimboyfriend** (6.6): nice, but repetitive

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): Very profound

**ignitethephoenix** (6): what an abrupt ending

**waluigiest** (6): no shade but this sounds like RuPaul

**wavingwolves** (6): this is has such meme potential

**bbfan132** (5): the instrumental reminds me of the one for you make me feel (mighty real) but this is way less interesting than that song

**DrunkHurricane** (4): 'born to be alive' is a really dumb lyric

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Ironic because that’s the opposite of how this song makes me feel

**nootnoot781** (4): the way he says born pisses me off so much

**ReallyCreative** (4): more like bored. bored. bored. bored. this song is either boring or obnoxious and the vocals are a huge reason why

**Kirby31200** (3): I do not like it

**loloeffeff** (3): overrated tbh...

**ManofOranges** (3): This song just sounds really weird and clumsy to me. It doesn't sound groovy enough for me to want to listen.

**NotWith10000Men** (3): what is with this weird frantic energy??? I feel like I'm late for something

**MrSwearword** (2): only because the production more than does the heavy lifting for this badly delivered song

**steelstepladder** (2): But you weren't born to make music for sure

**bespectacIed** (1): wutice dis

This rate said “FUCK one of the first disco #1 hits ever!” and its kinda wrong for that! Rock Your Baby isn’t exactly groundbreaking in retrospect, but it was monumental in it’s time! The vocals here are really soothing to me. This song’s soft tone really feels like something you can rock your baby or your actual baby to. 

**Covering the Covers:** How about this for a twist? Here we have KC & The Sunshine Band covering this song in 1975. [Their cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPTLSdXjRZc) is a fully instrumental version where a saxophone takes control of the vocal melody of the song. It’s ok.

#*Notorious BIG Voice* Baby Baby

**ManofOranges** (10): Such a damn sultry guitar, as soon as I heard that I knew I was giving this song a 10

**bbfan132** (9): a bit too repetitive for it to be a 9.5 or a 10 but i loved the instrumental and he sounded great too

**conceptualromance** (9): Another one I’ve never heard before but am really enjoying

**1998tweety** (8.5): bops a bit

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Yes we love straight men who are comfortable enough in their sexuality to embrace their submissive side!

**rslashpoopheads** (8): this is good vibes

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): Pleasant if slightly forgettable.

#But I'm already someone else's baby

**camerinian** (7): I mean, dude really fucking nails that one line

**CarlieScion** (7): men.

Ok so reading up on this, i am shook to find out that THIS WAS BASICALLY COMMISSIONED BY THE US NAVY TO GET PEOPLE TO JOIN THE NAVY AND I’M SORRY?????????? I can not believe that the village people were actually used for propaganda just because disco was popular and YMCA was a hit. Imagine if someone like Arizona Zervas was contacted by the LAPD to make a tiktok song about joining the police academy. That’s the equivalent of this song. I’m fucking screaming. 

**Covering the Covers:** Camp? 70s? Crazy costumes? Sounds like something that The Muppet Show will be all over! Unsurprisingly, [they made their own version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTwq1_9VH68) of this sung by viking muppets. Just enjoy the muppets.

#Come Sail Away!

**bespectacIed** (10): Yasss normalize the f-word-ttry in toxic masculine spaces, kings!

**ManofOranges** (10): The only time I will ever entertain even the idea of me being in the armed forces.

**vayyiqra** (10): Gay military propaganda that is also a bop is still a bop and ships are cool so points were made about the merits of serving in the navy. (Comment is half-ironic. I do not recommend joining the military at this time.)

**wavingwolves** (10): ''but...but... I AM AFRAID OF WATER!!!!'' please this is such a gem of a song

**skargardin** (9): another iconic bop

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): Victor Willis can get it

**CarlieScion** (8): actually all of the village people songs are gay

**ReallyCreative** (8): the subtext is... well

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.7): but...i’m afraid of water!!

**conceptualromance** (7.5): The actual US Navy hasn’t done half as much for this country as Village People has

**hikkaru** (7.5): this song is so funny... of all artists/groups to make a navy propaganda song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the only thing that could convince me to join the Navy

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): im taking points off that this was a genuine song that the navy commissioned from this band. I assumed it was a joke

#This song is a war crime

**1998tweety** (7): this doesnt do much for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): It’s a decent song and I get the joke but the jingoism is a bit much

**nbapip** (7): Muppets version wins

**rickikardashian** (6.8): okay this is propaganda

**slimboyfriend** (6.8): can u believe the US navy almost let these gay stereotypes advertise with this blatantly homoerotic song

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): I get that it’s a camp classic, but this is unfortunately kind of forgettable.

**waluigiest** (6): I think my first exposure to this song was on the Muppet Show?

**rslashpoopheads** (5): like budget YMCA

**Mysario** (4.6): YVAN EHT NIOJ

**camerinian** (4): 👏 MORE 👏 QUEER 👏 IMPERIALIST 👏 WARMONGERS 👏

**MrSwearword** (3): "Yvan Eht Nioj" outsold this overrated fluff

**steelstepladder** (3): One of my good friends joined the navy and I sing this to him all the time... that's about the only use I can think of for this

**bbfan132** (2): a boring rehash of ymca

**cremeebrulee** (0): sorry im anti military

**NotWith10000Men** (0): let's not join the military y'all

**RandomHypnotica** (0): This is just explicit propoganda, and it makes me feel pretty uncomfortable tbh. I mean, I know YMCA was too, but the YMCA is a beneficial place, the Navy is a whole career and lifestyle, and it involves a significant amount of risk… It just feels weird to have a song about how the Navy is so much fun and the best decision you could make , when it's a branch of the US Military.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): t's not a conincidence disco died shortly after this bad propoganda was assocated wth it

Its Beethoven but disco. 

**Covering the Covers:** I mean, of course there’s plenty of covers of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, its arguably one of the most recognizable pieces of music ever. So, let’s just enjoy the beautiful visuals of [Fantasia 2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnlxYkZKaU) while it plays.

---

#To be fair, you have to have a high IQ to enjoy classical music

**bulforster** (10): Beethoven got a number one 150 years after his death, Lizzo who?

**ManofOranges** (10): It's pure comedy to me, hearing Beethoven's 5th and then the funk comes in. It's amazing. I have no words, and neither does this song seeing as how there are no lyrics, but that's perfectly fine because it doesn't need them.

**MrSwearword** (10): OK this was always lowkii iconic.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): outsold original

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): i really hope this places high because it goes off tbh

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**NotWith10000Men** (9): okay this is dope as hell and a great way to end this playlist

**rickikardashian** (9): this is the disco equivalent of trap remixes of classical music

**wavingwolves** (9): the way this song ended beethoven's whole career... as it should

**steelstepladder** (8): Actually way ahead of its time

**waluigiest** (8): LMAO

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): take classical music but make it disco...also wait does Robin Thicke’s want to get you alone song samples this?

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): It's iconic, but I really wish there was lyrics too

**agentofscranton** (6.5): the mrs. america opening titles are a 10 tho

#Has beethoven ever won a grammy? NO! Ariana outsold

**bbfan132** (6): when i get you alone was playing along in my head the whole time

**benjamin\_boo** (6): A weird track but it kinda bops

**conceptualromance** (6): Not sure if I like the use of Beethoven’s Fifth, but that could just be because it’s been so bastardized by commercials at this point.

**cremeebrulee** (6): it’s fine but it’s also kind of just there

**J\_Toe** (6): Judge Judy but make it disco

**pat-rickstar** (6): Not my headphones running out of charge in the last minute of the last song of the rate

**bespectacIed** (5): this outsold https://youtu.be/nRTBM4UwnBs

**camerinian** (5): I cannot fucking believe I'm saying this, but the Robin Thicke version is better

**hikkaru** (5): hmmm

**rosecoloreds** (5): this is what people who mashup nicki's songs with classical music think that they're doing

**Hielord** (4.8): Not the most original song in this rate I have to say, ehehe

**Mysario** (4.2): baby yo where you at got no strings got men attached

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): so when does the intro end and the song start

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): because blame robin thicke and also that beeping synth noise is the stuff of nightmares.

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.5): A gimmick that just doesn’t hold up, if it ever did.

**vayyiqra** (2): Disco x classical was the worst crossover trend ever in music until country x hiphop came to be. I strongly dislike this. It's gimmicky and cringey.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): This doesn't need to exist.

**rslashpoopheads** (0): everyone is gonna give this a 10 and make "witty" comments about high culture but deep down we all know it's just bad

this song makes me feel like a girl dancing for the king of a foreign land, who I’ve actually known since childhood and we have had a deep personal connection since we kissed at 17. While to the rest of the kingdom, I’m just known as the entertainment at his soirees, in reality, I’m also his lover… aka this song is good. Fun Fact: In Baccara’s 1980 single “Sleepy-Time-Toy” one of the duo felt like her voice was not as prominent as the other, and sued RCA for breaching her contract. A court hearing eventually got 250K different records recalled with a new vocal mix added. After this, the group never really recovered from the fight and they eventually split up to release their own solo albums. The girls were FIGHTINGGGG. 

**Covering the Covers:** UK pop star Sophie Ellis-Bextor had a version of this song released as a b-side with her song I Won’t Change You. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNOXA1-bT0c) is a eurodance/nu-disco cover that is interesting but I’d hesitate to call it good.

#Can Boogie

**CarlieScion** (10): yes maam

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): kinda iconic how they reference the song itself during the song

**J\_Toe** (10): I imagine this is the song playing in Valentina's head whenever she is in drag as a telenovela goddess

**plastichaxan** (10): gay anthem

**rickikardashian** (10): oh to be a sensual, mysterious woman with a heavy foreign accent seductively flirting with a man at a disco

**skargardin** (10): [I'll just leave this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4QTXZMFcos)

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): Sultry, seducing, fun

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.1): yes sir...i CAN boogie! no it’s true, it’s true!

**succulentils** (9): Gotta admit I'd never heard this before I saw that video of Valentina performing it in WeHo

**waluigiest** (9): the drama!!!!

**wavingwolves** (9): all that moaning at the start is a choice but this is such a good song

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): I wonder how many times the words "boogie," "dance" etc are mentioned in total throughout this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): Her accent, particularly on the word boogie is so adorable it makes the whole song for me

**letsallpoo** (8): sophie ellis-bextor's cover of this is also good

**Mysario** (8): I've never heard this in my life but it's my fave "unknown" of the rate

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): are these people Russian?

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): Stan Valentina https://youtu.be/o6C0rEOjxKU

#No bitch, I can't boogie

**TiltControls** (7.5): this sounds very much like a lesser version of don't leave me this way...

**1998tweety** (7): cute but kinda doesn't go anywhere

**Kirby31200** (7): Enjoyable stupid fun

**loloeffeff** (7): Goldfrapp did it better !

**Hielord** (6.5): Who said spaniards cannot boogie

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's fine but there are a lot of songs that do this exact same thing but a lot better

**bbfan132** (6): meh, not that exciting

**benjamin\_boo** (6): A fun song that would be sandwiched between two superior bops in the discotheque.

**bulforster** (6): Starts to get annoying by the end

**Roxieloxie** (6): welcüm to mæ kïtćhëń

**sandyfishnets** (6): ummmm those orgasmic moans are not it but the chorus is epic

**slimboyfriend** (6): A mayonnaise Don't Leave Me This Way

**conceptualromance** (5): I don’t vibe with this one at all

**ManofOranges** (5): Well... it doesn't really sound like it.

**MrSwearword** (5): I mean, it's fine but this is inconsequential as fuck. Bonus points for a messy moment as Valentina is faked out of a tip at a club on video.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): it's…. a song….

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I lied I can indeed give a disco song less than a 7.

**steelstepladder** (4): I sang the title to the tune of Yes by McAlmont and Butler and I like that better than the song I actually got

**camerinian** (2): this is just bootleg Don’t Leave Me This Way

**cocosairdep** (0): Painfully boring song. The instrumentals felt pretty generic, and the vocals didn’t sound good at all.

**patcheso8** (0): this song is why I really don't like a lot of disco tbh.

Barry Manilow: Here’s a fun disco track that will be played at weddings forever with horns, strings and great background singers.   
Everyone: That sounds so cute! Let’s hear it!  
Barry: Ok! It’s about a showgirl at this club and she falls in love with the bartender in the same club.  
Everyone: Omg that’s so cute!  
Barry: And then he gets into a fight where he was shot dead and so the showgirl is now working at the club after it turned into a disco where she becomes depressed alcoholic who is slowly losing her mind in her old age :). 

**Covering the Covers:** Shirley Bassey, best known for her James Bond theme songs, released a cover not long after the release of this song. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0iNs_d7j6U) is a blues-ier version that has her stretching out notes for no real reason? I’d stick to the original tbh.

#Lola back then

**ManofOranges** (10): People love to point out how this song is actually a very sad song but to the tune of a very happy song, but it seems that nobody just loves to talk about how good this song is! I fell in love.

**rickikardashian** (10): why am i crying to disco *love boat*

**steelstepladder** (10): Yeah why not I can give a ten to Barry Manilow

**wavingwolves** (10): is this a motherfucking brazilian reference? (yes). i have a soft spot for this song and i think it has a lot of interesting elements to keep itself interesting

**RandomHypnotica** (9.9): It's got storytelling, killer vibes and a smooth voice, what more could you want?

**agentofscranton** (9.5): dae this song dark???

**vayyiqra** (9): I can't take this seriously. It's been parodied way too much, included a really cringe version about Star Wars, and parodies based on Star Wars are never good. It's a classic, but also it's been ruined for me. But it's still a classic.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**Kirby31200** (8): His voice was a little hard to get used to but it grew on me. I am a sucker for story songs

**Mysario** (8): this song is so gosh darn horrible yet I get why they made a musical out of just this garbage

**skargardin** (8): I don't think i've heard this before but it's kinda slaying i have to say

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): This is pure cheese

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): cheesy but there's some surprisingly good elements to this

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): Sounds like the intro of a fun, slow 70s show

**Hielord** (7.4): Bitch why are the lyrics so dark lmao, I never really payed attention

**camerinian** (7): I only know Barry Manilow based on reputation, and from this I fully get it, but if you're gonna be cheesy, you may as well go whole hog and be "Disco but it's Actual Film Noir-style Murder" cheesy.

**jsonphile** (7): Barry Manilow is incredibly lame, but I love a good dance song that ends in murder. Easily his best/most fun song

**NotWith10000Men** (7): does barry manilow know you raid his wardrobe?

**Roxieloxie** (7): i feel like im at high school theater kid performance

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I can't in good conscience give a disco song less than a 7.

**slimboyfriend** (6.9): You're telling me people were surprised when he came out

#Lola now

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): the musical theatre kid energy this has

**CarlieScion** (6): a man? in my popheads rate?

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Started out great, but got old really quick.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I *should* like this because I do theatre and this is what a lot of old theatre songs sound like but at the same time a lot of old theatre was forgotten for a reason. This is a tangent but I was annoyed when Barry Manilow came out and everyone was like “oh we knew” bitch no you didn’t, you don’t know a closeted person’s identity until they come out and tell you!

**pat-rickstar** (6): A karoake classic in my family but not really my favourite song here

**ReallyCreative** (6): I like the fact that this is more of a narrative but overall it's just not that interesting to listen to, never been a Manilow man myself

**conceptualromance** (5): Barry Manilow’s voice is…well it’s something

**MrSwearword** (5): disco solves a lot of problems, Barry Manilow's boring vocal delivery being one of them

**JustinJSrisuk** (4.5): Goddamn is this cheesy, and this is from someone who lives for frommage. My mother in law, god rest her soul, loved this song and most-definitely boogied to it at Italian weddings on Long Island in 1979.

**loloeffeff** (4): I know this makes me a bad gay but Barry Manilow does nothing for me :(

**benjamin\_boo** (2): It’s certainly a song.

**bbfan132** (1): no.

**bespectacIed** (1): that friends episode where rachel sang this at barry and mindy's wedding, I hate it

Go West may or may not be about telling gays to go to San Francisco to feel secure. Weirdly sounding more like US armed forces propaganda than In The Navy, this is my least favorite Village People song in this rate. Its hard to listen to this without thinking about how similar it is to In The Navy tbh. Not to mention, the Pet Shop Boys kinda wiped the floor with them and their cover was much bigger worldwide than the original. 

**Covering the Covers:** The Pet Shop Boys’ version of Go West is probably more famous than Village People’s version. [The fellow gay icons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNBjMRvOB5M) version is basically an anthem for gay communists everywhere. Like for real, look at the music video. If you’re a gay communist, there’s like a 90% chance you already stan this.

---

#To the west, to the west

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite songs in the rate! There’s layers to this song, I think it’s really cool that the exact same song can function as a dance club anthem and a football chant. The theme of longing for a better life where you and the people you love can be safe and happy (which is more or less what “west” represents in this song) is eternally resonant.

**J\_Toe** (10): to me this is the most sincere and perhaps 'least gimmick-y' of the big songs from the Village People. Like, it could have been performed without irony by other artists (as it did with the Pet Shop Boys)

**ManofOranges** (10): The sun after rising in the east every day.

**sandyfishnets** (9): I had no idea this was a Village People song!!

**1998tweety** (8): its cute i guess

**nootnoot781** (8): this one of the gayest songs i’ve ever listened to omg

**rickikardashian** (7.8): this feels like propaganda

#I thought you said "Weast"

**camerinian** (7): I will be personally responsible for the fall of western civilization

**rslashpoopheads** (7): oh my god these are all just gonna sound like YMCA knockoffs aren't they

**slimboyfriend** (7): Their shtick gets old after a few songs

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): this is literally In The Navy but worse

**bespectacIed** (5): eh

**skargardin** (5): a very inferior YMCA i have to say, like the progression is almost identical

**Hielord** (4.6): Needs more funk tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (4.4): This feels like the aural equivalent of watching an old movie that my grandparents love but I just really don't get it

This is probably one of the most mindless songs in the rate. This is a song that wants you to dance and specifically shake your ass. One of the earliest ass anthems to be a hit, this song has a lot of live instrumentation and tells you to shake a *lot*, but outside of the actual hook, there’s something that doesn’t feel fun about the verses (if you can call them that). Its still a bop and im twerking, but idk there’s something missing.

**Covering the Covers:** One of the guys that made many songs from this rate, Giorgio Moroder made a cover of this in the 90s. [His version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gei5sKjrdqQ), which I can only find a preview of on youtube, sounds like a remix of an actual disco cover of the song.

#Miley in Bangerz

**CarlieScion** (10): okay if u ask so nicely

**MrSwearword** (10): this is the only group whose white people disco is welcome

**rslashpoopheads** (10): all the twinks in the room instinctively start throwing it back

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): One of the preeminent examples of a long and rich legacy of songs about asses that also includes trumpets.

**vayyiqra** (9): This rate is making me realize just how many disco songs were parodied on The Simpsons, which had a whole character devoted to making fun of it (Disco Stu), and it makes sense given how old the writers were, yet it's super weird to hear them all again in this rate. Anyway this song makes me cringe hard but also it's a bop ngl.

**camerinian** (8): HARDCORE NUDITY!

**sandyfishnets** (8): anyway else forced to do 80's Richard Simmons workout routine to this song in gym class? just me?

**1998tweety** (7): its ok

#Miley in Younger Now Era

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.8): too corny :(

**slimboyfriend** (6.8): Groovy, but goes nowhere

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): fucking vibe but like it’s just too repetitive for a full song

**ManofOranges** (6): This one is fine enough. At least I like it better than "That's the Way I Like it."

**bbfan132** (5): kind of annoying actually but i like the instrumental

**skargardin** (5): this is fine

Is it bad that i think this is the best Bee Gees song in this rate? Possibly. Probably. Kinda? Most Likely. But come on, these strings are exquisite! This is still better than Night Fever though, so seethe people that wanted it in this rate! Oh, apparently this wasn’t even a hit song, so maybe Night Fever was robbed after all. 

**Covering the Covers:** UK boyband 911 (shut up gaga stans) made a cover version in 1998 that became their 2nd highest charting single in the UK. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIsZTD9PAmo) is basically what you think of when hearing “90s UK Boyband covering Bee Gees”

---

#"More Than A Woman" is a song about breaking the gender binary, in this essay I

**ManofOranges** (10): Oooh this one is just so smooth to me.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): MORE THAN A WOMAN

**vayyiqra** (10): A heterosexual anthem! White men really snapped on this one.

**bbfan132** (9): probably will place low but i like how mellow but still rhythmic this song is, especially when you contrast it with a song like stayin’ alive

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Good but not a favourite of mine

**conceptualromance** (8.7): I like the dreamy atmosphere of this song

**bespectacIed** (8): Here to complain about saturday night fever being one of the biggest albums of all time yet its excellent title track was robbed a spot in the rate

**ReallyCreative** (8): the Bee Gees really gave birth to Scissor Sisters, I have to show respect even if they aren't my favorite

**Hielord** (7.5): I feel the Bee Gees are really underrated. I grew up with my mom playing their CDs all they long, so I might be biased. But they're great

**1998tweety** (7): cute

#That's a man maury

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): definitely my least fave out of the 3 bee gees songs in this rate

**pat-rickstar** (7): My least favourite Bee Gees song here

**slimboyfriend** (6.7): The melody is so pretty that I think I'd like the song more if it was slower and not entirely in falsetto

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): At a certain point the Gibbs’ falsettos start to become nails of a chalkboard.

**Kirby31200** (6): "We really need to have a serious talk about the birds and the Bee-gees. You see, when the Bee-Gees recorded Saturday Night Fever, everybody loved them. Then there was a backlash. 'Too much Bee-gees!', they said."

**wavingwolves** (6): the way this is a 3min song that feels like a 5min one bc of how much the ending drags... still solid tho

**camerinian** (5): We can get rid all the Bee Gees ballads forever and we'll lose nothing

**MrSwearword** (5): the thing with this group is their production slaps but the vocals are awful. For some reason, I don't consider this a classic even by their low standards.

**skargardin** (5): this was incredibly boring im sad to say

**steelstepladder** (5): not awful by any means but who's going into this rate really pulling for More Than a Woman y the Bee Gees?

**waluigiest** (5): I’m underwhelmed

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): There’s a few seconds of goodness in here but on the whole it’s kind of grating.

Honestly… the one of the worst songs in the rate imo. It’s just not that interesting to me, and the first part is actively boring to me. Maybe I’m too home of sexual for the sexiness to actually work for me, but I just want to skip it. Not to mention, I feel like the vocals on here are not that good and kinda bad at points? Also, the 2020 remix of this song was the last #1 on the club charts before coronavirus shut down all the clubs so it’ll be the last number one indefinitely. Maybe Miss Ross won in the end. 

**Covering the Covers:** Jody Watley, best known for Looking for A New Love, had a slowed down, R&B cover of the song for her 2006 album. [Her version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdN2CjBu-o) is better than the slow parts of Love Hangover, but not better than the second part.

#Taio Cruz - Hangover

**bbfan132** (10): i love how lush this song is, the strings were a perfect touch

**bespectacIed** (10): rating diana ross just reminds me we need a motown rate so the supremes could demolish

**jd1z** (10): iconic transition

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's a really good twist, but it's probably my least favorite of the Diana Ross songs in this rate. Still a 9. Still iconic.

**steelstepladder** (9): I'd kinda rather have it just start as a bop rather than have the slow build but once it gets going its great

**wavingwolves** (8.5): moodier and smoothier disco tracks >

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**vayyiqra** (8): no thoughts just vibes

**waluigiest** (8): she really found the pocket here

#Psy ft. Snoop Dogg and/or Lion - Hangover

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Love the concept of this one but the execution of it doesn’t go as hard as I’d like it to

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): kind of fillery

**ManofOranges** (7): I'm feeling a lil tipsy just listening to this song.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I can't in good conscience give a disco song less than a 7.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): I was NOT expecting that beat change, and I'm not really sure how I feel about it, cause I was really digging the vibe of the first half of the song more :(

**skargardin** (6): never really went anywhere for me pensive

**CarlieScion** (5): chain reaction deserved to be here over this !

**NotWith10000Men** (5): not a fan of the rhythm change or whatever that was after the first verse

**Mysario** (2.5): a half ballad? in my disco rate?

**MrSwearword** (1): Eric Kupper did a much much better job with this song but oh my god, this original version is so laborious. FUN FACT: The Eric Kupper remix of this was the last #1 on the Dance Club Play songs chart before the pandemic fucked everything up.

Alright, all y’all were so MEAN to Ms Alicia’s vocals! I like them! They give the song a real texture that not a lot of songs in this rate have. Also, this song did say LESBIAN RIGHTS! because Alicia is a lesbian herself. Side note: remember when this song was used to make Homer Simpson realize [he hates John Waters and the gays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9n2lVqFYWM) in that episode. Straight media being gay positive was weird in the late 90s ^^and ^^early ^^00s ^^tbh, but this song was always a bop! 

**Covering the Covers:** 80s synthpop group Bronski Beat made an [electronic cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5KwDx-H0MM) of the song. It’s an okay cover that is surprisingly close to the vocals of the original, but stream Smalltown Boy instead.

#I love the nightlife AND this song

**bespectacIed** (10): My mom loves this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I like the country vibes of this song? I initially gave this a lower score but then I realized it was one of the few songs in the rate I kept going back to of my own volition, I just love her voice with the music here.

**ManofOranges** (10): For as long as I could remember, I only knew this song as the song that has the line "I want some action, I want to live" because the way she says action is just so weird to me that it stuck, and then I finally actually found out what this song was called only like a few months ago or something like that. Anyways I love it.

**MrSwearword** (10): a vocalist with the range of A to Limited Vocalist but serves on this song and if my memory is right, she came out as a lesbian, being the only lesbian to do disco.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): jesus christ I forgot this song existed but hearing ACK SHAWN just hurtled me straight back to my childhood

**Hielord** (9.5): I will listen to this song after I cry before sleep, maybe everything will get better. I hope.

#They said "Lesbian rights!" after saying "fuck"

**1998tweety** (6.5): meh

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): So many of these I won't recognise from the titles/artists but will know once they get to the chorus, I can already tell. This is one of those.

**slimboyfriend** (6.3): What kind of accent does this woman have

**CarlieScion** (6): the disco riihhhiiiiihhhhhiiiiiihhhhhhiiiiide

**steelstepladder** (6): Not awful but I just don't think she has the right voice for this type of music.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): The way she sings really bothers me honestly

**JustinJSrisuk** (5.5): I just can’t with her accent and intonation - she sounds like Tennille from Captain and Tennille and Loretta Lynn merged into a disco diva and it’s incredibly unnerving.

**Mysario** (5.4): give me extended version or give me death

Marvin Gaye was asked by his record label to make a disco song and this is what he created in response. A sort of introverted disco anthem, Got To Give It Up is about someone who went from wallflower to picking up girls on the dancefloor. It’s one of the most unusual songs in the rate, but that does not mean its a bad one. Recognizable from the crowd chatter throughout the song and it’s unusual groove, most of the song is carried on the back of the vocalist. It might be hard for singer to carry a whole song, but when the singer is Marvin Gaye, its not surprising that it works great. 

**Covering the Covers:** In 2013, R&B artists Robin Thicke and Pharell teamed up with TI for their own version of the tune. [Their cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDUC1LUXSU) is a much more horny version of the song that changes the lyrics a whole lot. Come to think of it, idk why this is in the covers. Oh well.

An alright set of verses with a great chorus. The production is also simple yet effective. Makes me want to shake my booty a bit, and who can resist the phrase “boogie oogie oogie til you just can’t boogie no more”? Fun Fact: A Taste Of Honey’s 2nd and only other hit was a cover of Sukiyaki. It’s a little uhhh… interesting that they made [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/Sukiyaki-a-taste-of-honey.jpg) the single cover, but Idk the problematicness/cancellability of this. So as [they say…](https://i.imgur.com/TcUIw7H.jpg) 

**Covering the Covers:** Bossa Nova singer Charli \_\_\_ made a [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMXt_su8Zk) of this song in the bossa nova style. It’s definitely a Bossa Nova cover of Boogie Oogie Oogie.

**bespectacIed** (10): giving automatic 10s for black women on this rate, not even gonna think!

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh starting off with a bop i see

**Kirby31200** (10): Wow! I had never heard this song but the instant I did a loved it. Just an irresistable groove

**skargardin** (10): one of the most iconic disco singles methinks, it's soo infectious

**1998tweety** (9): big bop, I like the vibe

**ReallyCreative** (9): a CLASSIC that borders on timeless

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): This one surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. That bassline is really funky and insistent and the singers have an easy, relaxed style that’s super appealing.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): This is the first song and it's really good but doesn't compare to some of what's coming so I'll be a little harsh with my score

#Mr. Oogie Boogie

**bbfan132** (7): fun track but nothing else to it, unfortunately

Its “someone, usually a man, who is regarded as hip and cool,” similar to a “Cool Cat.” It’s a fun song, but not really memorable, and I feel like the male vocals on here could’ve been used more and to better effect here. Also, Just Dance 2018 made a dance to this that I feel like was set up to be THE sequel song to Rasputin, but they used that stupid panda as the dancer and the routine is so less fun than Rasputin that no one cared. 

**Covering the Covers:** Euro Rock group Placebo did a cover of Daddy Cool because of course a rock group is gonna cover a disco song. [Their version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7NYwlRyxrM) is better than expected, due to the vocals of the original having the male vocals that lends itself to a bit of a dark tone. Still not gonna stream it ever again.

#Cool me down daddy 😩💦💦

**bespectacIed** (10): rivers of babylon robbed

**camerinian** (10): First time I heard this I legit thought it was a modern-style disco throwback, not an actual disco hit. That's how well this has aged. Yep, absolutely nothing about this is weird and cringy now. Nothing.

**ManofOranges** (10): Another hit

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this instrumental is just incredible tbh

**skargardin** (10): the daddy... COOOOL hook never gets old, ICONIC

**J\_Toe** (9): dont like the clicky sound at the beginning and throughout, but not enough to give this song a score less than 9

**loloeffeff** (9): iconic

**plastichaxan** (8.8): any song with daddy in the title makes me feel seen

**Hielord** (8.4): Ugh this makes me feel things...

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): bop but too repetitive with no substance. Also is this a sugar daddy anthem?

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): It's fun but if Rasputin goes out before it I'm leaving

**Roxieloxie** (7): why are both of these songs so horny

#Father

**steelstepladder** (6): Imagine calling someone Daddy Cool unironically in 2020 omfg

**wavingwolves** (6): this is catchy but i do hate the lyrics

**JustinJSrisuk** (5.5): A catchy synth-violin hook but little else.

**bbfan132** (5): i have no thoughts on this

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Look, I’m uncomfortable.

**Kirby31200** (5): Dated in a funny way

**MrSwearword** (4): yikes when not singing about Rusiian mystics, this group kind of sucks.

**NotWith10000Men** (1): no <3

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Everything about this makes me uncomfortable

First of all, can we talk about how  this was originally gonna be a *country* song called “You're My First, You're My Last, My In-Between???” Anyways, Barry White makes me feel like I’m about to get pregnant (that spoken word intro SWOON!) but the rest of this song, I find unremarkable. He really is the best part of this song by far, and any other singer would make this forgettable, case in point... 

**Covering the Covers:** UK commercial mascot, Howard Brown made a charity single cover of the song in 2005. [His version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6udzxjDT5pI) of the song doesn’t stray too far from the original, aside from the fact that instead of one of the best vocalists of the 20th century singing, it’s a commercial mascot.

---

#First

**J\_Toe** (10): this is the exact song I was hope to hear in this rate and I'm so happy we have a chance to rate it! (for reference, i know it from the dark shadows soundtrack)

**MrSwearword** (10): There's a good chance millions of people were made to this song

**jsonphile** (9): I'm a straight guy but Barry's voice does things to my soul

**ManofOranges** (9): Barry White's is so damn sexy. This song is just groovy. But I do wish it were "Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe"

**steelstepladder** (9): Barry White deserves but I don't trust popheads here at all

**camerinian** (8.5): Barry’s voice makes my prostate quiver

**benjamin\_boo** (8): Me? Sweating. My basement? Flooding.

**skargardin** (8): banger

**wavingwolves** (8): fun fact: this was initially written as a country song

**slimboyfriend** (7.6): his voice is so hot I'd kind of prefer this as a spoken word piece

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**CarlieScion** (7): slightly better than the previous man song

#Last

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): Love those disco strings, but “Can’t Get Enough of Your Love” outsold.

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): this song sounds the way oil sheen smells

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): ehhh it's aight

**bbfan132** (6): it’s not bad but i would probably change the radio station to something more interesting if this was playing

**bespectacIed** (6): it's ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’m not lowballing the score on this one because he’s a man or anything like that but I’m not connecting with this…

**Mysario** (5.5): 😳

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): It’s not bad but it's not exactly great either

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): this song is kinda...just there for me.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Barry sometimes eats but this ain't it.

One of the few songs that never made the hot 100 in this rate, peaking at #1 on bubbling under, Last Night A DJ Saved My Life has lasted and grown since their original run. Technically a “post-disco” song (and even sounds like a freestyle song at points), this still fits in perfectly with the groove of this rate. But the real question is, how did the DJ save her life? The DJ saved her by playing a song that kept her with her man by stopping her boredom by playing a song that made her want to dance instead of cheat. Idk if I’d stick with my gf if she was ready to cheat on me just cause she was bored but whatever, i’m not a heterosexual. 

**Covering the Covers:** From the critically demolished film “Glitter,” Mariah Carey has a cover of this with Fabolous, Busta Rhymes, and DJ Clue. [This cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjP4YfMZgik) is part rap and part sample of the original? I understand that the Fantasy Remix worked well but having 2 different rappers on here just nonstop adlibbing while mariah barely tries to sound invested is a very stupid decision.

---

#\#JusticeForGlitter

**bbfan132** (10): giving this a 10 solely because of the rap verse in the bathroom

**Hielord** (10): If this song doesn't make it to at least Top 15 you are all cancelled.

**Roxieloxie** (10): half of this rate are just songs that are on that 1 family friend car playlist my dad has been playing since i was six

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.4): this is so funky

**bespectacIed** (9): one hit wonder bop

**CarlieScion** (9): bop but im taking one point off for making me think someone was ringing my door

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love this song, I feel so cool just strutting around to it. I’m still angry about all of the screaming Mariah layered over her cover of it because her singing this should have been a dream but instead it was an overproduced mess.

**vayyiqra** (9): 😌 💃

**conceptualromance** (8.5): The drain sound effect halfway through the song is kind of hilarious

**MrSwearword** (8): it goes in but I've never associated this with being disco but looking into it this was apparently released in 1983 when disco was basically dead in its original form.

**skargardin** (8): stream glitter

**Mysario** (7.7): remember going out to see DJs? 😔

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**agentofscranton** (7.5): me the morning after i heard into you play in the club for the first time

#You know the gif i'd link here

**ManofOranges** (7): It's very possible that a DJ could save your life, but I don't think it would be with a song like this one. Also, what's with the sound effects? Very interesting...

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I can't in good conscience give a disco song less than a 7.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's just not super compelling

**cremeebrulee** (6): the guitar is good but something is just missing for me

**wavingwolves** (6): kinda of a bop but i'm not a fan of the pissing noise or whatever that was

**WillamThunderfuck** (6): Kinda repetitive

**steelstepladder** (5): Really wish the instrumental on the chorus popped more. I like the sound effects though Migos could never

**camerinian** (4): I busted a fucking gut laughing at the flushing toilet first time I heard this and it's just tainted every attempt to listen to it since

**Kirby31200** (4): Bland

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.5): The sound of a toilet flushing that plays towards the end of the track is a fitting end for this dull as dishwater song.

**cocosairdep** (3): The sounds effects in this one are something else. Not giving this one the 0 because the DJ part at the end genuinely made me laugh.

Maybe a hot take, but the instrumental bridge is just too busy to enjoy. It does a lot, but it starts tripping over itself. Also, it’s easily their weakest hook in this rate. I’m just thinking about how this was used in Saturday Night Fever as well as Despicable Me, the defining movies of their generations. 

**Covering the Covers:** Well, making a section of this rate talking about covers of these songs, you knew GLEE would show up sooner or later. Featured in the episode “Saturday Night GLEE-ver” (sigh) [their cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEhi1_jZr5s) is a fun little tune between Blaine, Brittany, and Mike. It’s not bad for a glee cover tbh!

---

#And i am!

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (10): definitely my favourite Bee Gees songs, probably an unpopular opinion on here

**ManofOranges** (10): This song reminds of the song that Mr. Krabs is cycling to when Spongebob walks in on him exercising while he milks (or I guess, jellies?) those jellyfish and it's like "give it all you got, spin, spin, spin, spin" and so that's all I think of when I hear this song.

**vayyiqra** (10): B O P

**camerinian** (9.5): YES I SHOULD BE DANCING OPEN THE DISCOS OBAMA I'M AN ESSENTIAL GROOVER

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Popheads don’t rob the Bee Gees just because they're men challenge

**rslashpoopheads** (9): oh im dancin alright

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): Hooks upon hooks upon hooks.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): honestly a timeless song!

**Hielord** (7.8): Yes, I should

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun track but i don’t like it as much as i enjoy the other two tracks by them

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): you should not be wearing those scarves fellas

**1998tweety** (7): cute

#Don't yell at me thnx

**conceptualromance** (6.5): For some reason I can’t take this song seriously

**MrSwearword** (5): again, good production and terrible vocals. At least this has a better chorus.

**skargardin** (5): i refuse

**steelstepladder** (5): I really don't like their voices on here for some reason

**wavingwolves** (4): the weakest of out of all the bee gee's songs in this rate

**bespectacIed** (2): Night Fever robbed

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): The title of this song is a 10/10 but it fails to live up to it.

Shake Your Groove Thing has been one of the songs that has kinda stuck with people through time. It’s been mentioned in plenty of pop culture pieces, most famously, of course, in *A Goofy Movie* where Goofy [INVENTS THE DAB!!!!](https://youtu.be/ait5pRVCd2g?t=48) A slick groove and Peaches & Herb having great chemistry certainly helps this song stick around for decades. 

**Covering the Covers:** oh fuck, time to talk about Alvin and The Chipmunks. They sadly did do a cover of this with Drew Seeley (damn remember him?) for one of their movies, and whew, i have a lot to talk about. [It’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEr7N630rAU) honestly even worse than you’d expect. First off, Drew is NOT chipmunked, he just has his normal vocals to completely not match with the Chipmunks whatsoever. The song has a fucking RAP POST CHORUS!!!! Luckily, neither credited “artists” are responsible for the rapping, but it’s just embarrassing. And I haven’t even gotten into the music video… *Stefon voice* This video has everything: clearly reused animation clips, 00s ringtone commercial backgrounds, terribly animated photos of the Chipmunks headbobbing, and Drew Seeley looking like a gay guy from the 00s MTV dating show Next.

**ManofOranges** (8): Really do love this one. It's got a real good groove to it. My only complaint is that I think it goes on too long! Which normally isn't a problem for me, but for this one it is.

**MrSwearword** (8): it's one of those "classic" songs that lost their luster over the years. It's fine but it isn't as good as most remember.

**rickikardashian** (7.8): mom! peaches & herb are making a disco song

**ignitethephoenix** (7): cute I guess

The Hustle is probably the most “background music” song in this rate, clocking in at even LESS words than the Silver Convention’s TWO 6 word atrocities. However, what The Hustle lacks in lyrics, it makes up for in great little instrumental parts. The opening ooh’s, the whispers of “do it…,” the strings slowly picking up, and of course, the iconic piccolo. Definitely makes me want to get up and do the hustle! 

**Covering the Covers:** Mights Sparrow is a reggae/calypso group. They [made a cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GN9I9E50m4) almost immediately after this song was released. That being said, i don’t think this sounds very reggae but i’d what genre i’d call this.

#Do the hustle, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

**bespectacIed** (10): this sounds like the pearly gates of heaven

**ManofOranges** (10): DO THE HUSTLE! The flute in this song is so good. It's impressive how much I dance to this song, it's got such a strong groove.

**MrSwearword** (10): even I'm not hateful enough to deny this song full marks

**conceptualromance** (9.5): I hear some kind of horn or trumpet or whatever and I go crazy

**benjamin\_boo** (9): A song and a dance that helped define a whole genre? Tell your fav to do better.

**J\_Toe** (8): this one is quite different to the rest of the tracks in the rate

**ReallyCreative** (8): I think growing up in an area where this song never really lost steam on some of the radio stations makes me resent it but it's a classic

**steelstepladder** (8): just lovely

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): Maddeningly catchy.

**camerinian** (7): I like how even though motifs recycle, every passage sounds different. Dude's a legit composer

**Kirby31200** (7): I don't know how to do the Hustle sorry

**waluigiest** (7): I want to dislike this but it’s nice

#Emperor Palpatine, NO!

**bbfan132** (6.5): a pleasant song but there’s not much else to it

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): lyrical genius right here. The production is so clean and nice though I can’t hate the fact there’s barely any content in the song

**CarlieScion** (6): hustlin

**vayyiqra** (5): This song is fine. It is a song that exists and is mildly pleasant to listen to. Idk why it was such a big hit because there is just not much to it aside from a neat little melody that repeats a lot.

**wavingwolves** (5): there's just something about that flute that doesn't spark joy

**Mysario** (4.4): this is pretty peak of what disco was: the way the guitar strums, the horns that carried the song, the typical drum beat, someone telling you to dance, and most of all, incredibly repetitive. Songs that survived the era had "it" but many didn't survive and it makes you wonder how many "The Hustle"s got lost to time. And for the best!

**rslashpoopheads** (4): NO!

**WillamThunderfuck** (3): This was used for an annoying commercial in the Netherlands so I hate it now

Aside from being a Mario Party 3 minigame [that can take forever to finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJysIpCsXUg), And The Beat Goes On is a surprisingly melancholy song. It’s about a man who just got out of a breakup and is sad about it, but knows that there is someone out there for him and the beat just goes on… It’s a real nice and easy song, if a little boring at a few parts. Still a good song! 

**Covering the Covers:** Legowelt is a Dutch EDM producer who goes by aliases such as Polarius, Smackos, Nacho Patrol, Jackmaster Corky, Twilight Moose and many others. [His version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2d6Ok4fXg8) feels very ambient and nice to listen to. A shame the video is very heterosexual 70s horniness.

From the movie *Car Wash*, Car Wash is a disco song that’s the theme song to the movie. The song is just “listen, if you don’t want to work too hard and don’t expect to be a millionaire, just come on down to the car wash,” and I respect that tbh. It makes working at the car wash seem more like a place for friends to hangout and to just have a funky time while washing some cars and meeting Richard Pryor and George Carlin. 

**Covering the Covers:** Okay, I KNOW what y’all have been waiting for. One of the most iconic covers in this rate, especially for CG animated cartoons. We have the cover of Car Wash sung by [Larry & Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lC70e8qGos) from the Veggietales! Wow, that cucumber can not fucking sing for shit.

#Clean af

**bespectacIed** (10): euphoric

**jd1z** (10): a perfect song

**bbfan132** (9): a fun song that i’ve always enjoyed but it’s not perfect

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I didn’t really appreciate this song until it came on the Pandora station towards the end of an eight hour work day once and I was like “oh, I get it now.” We spend all day in the salt mines, so we might as well celebrate the fun parts of dead end labor, right? Aren’t we all, metaphorically, working at the car wash, yeah? Capitalism, am I right ladies?

**NotWith10000Men** (9): I think the key to a great disco song is keeping it simple

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): Never has a menial job sounded so cool and exciting. BTW there should totally be a song for all the other shitty jobs, movie theatre usher, valet attendant, census taker.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.2): mentally preparing for it to go out on day 1

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): no song has ever summed up what it feels like to work at a car wash as well as this one!

**vayyiqra** (8): Me and my brother liked this song when we were kids. It was a meme before we knew what memes were. It's dumb, but I still like it anyway.

#You missed a spot...

**J\_Toe** (7): there are two versions of this song, the 5:07 version, and the 0:03 version of just that iconic phrase. Having only ever listened to the iconic hook, this didn't live up to what I hoped, but it still really good

**skargardin** (5): the car wash is just about the only place where i would willingly listen to this again

**TiltControls** (4.5): i liked the verses, but apparently there is only so many times i am willing to hear the words car wash

**wavingwolves** (4): this mades no points

#WILL SMITH FACE FISH

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, we love shark tale

**ManofOranges** (10): Thanks to Shark Tale for bestowing this song upon my mind. No song could make a car wash sound more appealing this one.

**MrSwearword** (10): if any of you refer to SharkTales or Christina Aguilera's trash version I'm beating you in the neck, because the original is superior by all merits.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): i can't believe they made a full length version after the success it had in the hit film shark tale

**rslashpoopheads** (10): invented seafood

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): thinking about the critically acclaimed early 2000s movie Shark Tale

**agentofscranton** (9): idk if this is gonna be a hot take or not but the christina / missy / fishsona version is better pls don't crucify me

**JunkyGS** (8.5): Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott shaking

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Shark Tale

**waluigiest** (8): this was my jam as a child thanks to the dreamworks movie Shark Tale

**Mysario** (7.9): when I hear this song and I'm reminded that Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott perfected this for the master film [Shark Tale](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/389885212177334285/675750658074345472/PENIS.gif)

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Christina Aguilera fish

**TragicKingdom1** (7): the xtina ft missy version is lowkey better

**CarlieScion** (6): this is not seminal classic car wash from shark tales

**rosecoloreds** (6): shark tales wasn't as iconic as shrek but they tried

**steelstepladder** (6): remember in Shark Tale where Will Smith fish was working at the whale wash?

**camerinian** (5): maybe it's just nostalgia talking but the Xtina/Missy Elliott version is so much better, to the point that the original sounds incomplete

mysario: >there should totally be a song for all the other shitty jobs ... census taker.

Another unfortunate 6 word song we can rate, with the words "hello I'm here with the census" followed by the sad sound of a door shutting

A cover of a Jackson 5 hit that became a bigger worldwide hit than the original, this is actually Gloria Gaynor’s first hit song, with I Will Survive coming 4 years later. While the production is good, nothing really sticks with me about this song. Of course it’s got good vocals, good production and all that jazz, but that’s about it. It’s good but not great. 

**Covering the Covers:** The Jackson 5 original song is much different than Gloria’s version. [The original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvmqYZr0RFo) is a much more lowkey and traditionally Motown sounding compared to the disco classic we know today.

---

#I don't want to say goodbye to this bop!

**bespectacIed** (10): legendaric

**MrSwearword** (10): Gloria Gaynor's best song, end of discussion

**wavingwolves** (10): tbh this is actually better than i will survive

**ManofOranges** (9): This is a pretty good song. Isn't quite a 10 for me but it's pretty damn strong.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): boppy

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Not particularly memorable, but fun.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A bop but her cover of “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” should be here instead

**rslashpoopheads** (8): work it

**slimboyfriend** (8): She sounds so different in this song

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): the slight turn in the chorus is really cool but otherwise it's just okay

**bbfan132** (7): kind of charming but the original is better

**skargardin** (7): bop

**steelstepladder** (7): A bit in the shadow of bigger and better tunes but still good

#Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): This would benefit from a remix or remaster - there’s just so much going on with the production that it drowns out Gaynor’s voice.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): The production has really aged this song, the quality is just really not great by today's standards

**benjamin\_boo** (4): The Jackson 5 did it better
