yatcho:

>Iconic

Agreed.  So iconic that even at #10 it feels way too low.

eklxtreme says "crazy nostalgic vibe, the chorus is perfection".  mindnoises says "This is really a good one. Actually cute."  

However, TwentyOneParrots says "-0.2 points because the ending's a bit shit".  supremeshieldon says "idk this song just does nothing for me".  TeamAwesome4 says "The verses are measurably better than the chorus, and the bridge seems lacking too."

high scores: whatsapilot, FuckUpSomeCommasYeah - 10

low scores: zombasteseses - 5, ThereIsNoSantaClaus - 6

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byQIPdHMpjc)

tipttt284 says "Catchy chorus".  eklxtreme says "loving the dynamics of the vocals, the beginning sample is alright".

ThereIsNoSantaClaus says "This felt way more fitting then Heartsigh. It's only an okay song but I like it better."  whatsapilot also mentions heartsigh, saying "this and heartsigh are among my favorite songs of all time now."

mindnoises in what I guess counts as a compliment says "One of their weaker songs and still so good."  yatcho says "The video to this song is haunting, the song is kind of forgettable though".

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EAFkBuPasM)

yatcho:

>Where did this beat come from?? Such a departure but it sounds really good

eklxtreme agrees, "the sample is pretty good and the chorus goes pretty hard, pretty basic but I can get down to this".  ThereIsNoSantaClaus says "One of the best songs on here, vocals and production are way more tightly done on this song, making it a good dance track. Love the beat."  TeamAwesome4 agrees "Solid stuff right here."

mindnoises says "This is like a slower version of trance music. Crystal clear sounds, the atmosphere... Killer. ~~i want to listen to this while on drugs~~"

however, TwentyOneParrots says "eh the indie-trap-pop isn't really working for me anymore. the verse and prechorus are great but the chorus is so mediocre."

mindnoises agrees, "Otherworldly."

yatcho says "This one always leaves me bald".    mother_rucker says "Best song on this album. The chorus is sublime."

however, eklxtreme says "it's not too interesting, the buildup is okay, the synths are nice".

yatcho begins with "Beautiful production and singing, just so pretty all around".

eklxtreme says "gets right into the action, her vocals are great here, the synth melody complement them great, I like the spitting percussion too".  

also, hellomochi says "Solid opening track."

on the other hand, ThereIsNoSantaClaus says "Didn't like this song much at all. The production feels to busy and clashing with the vocals."  mindnoises agrees "All in all amazing, but there's something that's a little bit "too much"."\

TeamAwesome4 says "Fine and enjoyable, but it needs to make me feel something or be “bop”-y to stand out more. I feel like I’d enjoy this song, maybe the whole album, in the rain."

TeamAwesome4 notes:

>“I have burned your bridges” might be the most overlooked line in this album. Usually when someone burns bridges, it’s of their own volition. An ex, toxic friends or family, that annoying co-worker, etc. When someone else burns your bridges, it’s very clearly sabotage of some variety. I’ve never heard the phrase uttered as a threat before, but the plausibility of it, along with how devastating it would be, makes it quite intimidating. The outro also gives me life, holy shit.

spacebabe27 says "the instrumental reminds me a lot of New Order".  

yatcho gushes "THE song that got me into Chrvches and my 4 year crush on Lauren".  eklxtreme says "love that chorus buildup and the synth drop, dynamics!!".

LandonKidatrea:

>deciding which song from “Our Own House” would get my 11/10 was the greatest internal struggle of my life

hellomochi says "Love the chorus!"  yatcho agrees "That pre-chorus is really cool".

However, mindnoises says "The Franz Ferdinand style beat is too bouncy for me. This is so 10 years ago. The small section just before the "ooh-ooh-ooh" is the best part."  letsallpoo asks "Why do all these songs sound the same?"

whatsapilot says "pop perfection".  eklxtreme says "what an anthem, I still wish the drumming was more complex in the chorus but throughout the rest of the song they're great, the tempo changes always get me, stellar vocals, love the outro".  TeamAwesome4 says "I cry from happiness listening to this song."

##letsallpoo says:

>#Obvious winner is obvious

TeamAwesome4 says "I always forget just how much I love Chvrches, but the lead track punches me in the face and yells, “Bitch, you LOVE this shit!”."  mother_rucker says "There is a reason this is one of their most popular songs."  spacebabe27 agrees "This song exemplifies everything that was to come in pop music tbh".  

eklxtreme says "Lauren's vocals are incredible and that vocal sample makes for an incredible melody, the booming synths just scream perfection".  supremeshieldon says "great catchy song not much to say".  hellomochi says "Solid opening track."  TwentyOneParrots says "Fucking banger".

However, mindnoises says "I don't like these harmonies at all. I think this song is the reason why I didn't like Chvrches at first."

#\#2 - Our Own House (8.36)

Controversy: 2.42 

High scores: Mudkip1, skiddos - 11, whatsapilot, zombastesese, eklxtreme, LandonKidatrea, supremeshieldon, TeamAwesome4 - 10

(sidenote: this song got no scores in between a 4 and a 7.5)

spacebabe27:

>Nice little energetic indie bop, got my ass moving at a moderate pace

eklxtreme says "the funk guitar and trumpets are an amazing combo and her vocals build up beautifully, i like that little outro".  

yatcho says "The one song I knew of theirs beforehand, super fun".  hellomochi agrees "Perfect opening to a high-energy album."  TeamAwesome4 agrees "Goddamn it, it’s so happy! It’s SO HAPPY! GUYS THIS IS SO HAPPY!, I DON’T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND!"

However, tipttt284 says "It's uneven and the funky, disco beat doesn't have enough of a funky, dancy feel."

mother_rucker says "It's kind of meh until the trumpets in the chorus kick in." but still gave it an 8 so...
