Altiondsols: A quick teaser/explanation:

The first four songs were this rate thread's Major Flops.  The bottom four songs (set apart by almost a full point on average) were as far from song #37 as song #37 was from song #10.

Altiondsols: #\#41 - Tightrope (5.31)

Controversy: 2.69

High scores: spacebabe27 - 9

Low scores: mother_rucker, JoshuaReddit, and Mudkip1 - 0, eykitsa - 1

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOMWNgejuPc)

One of the major criticisms was that it doesn't have the power of the original.  Mudkip1 says, "lmao @ this flop. Sucks out all of the energy that Janelle Monáe did so well and gives nothing back in return. What a boring cover."  whatsapilot agrees, "this doesn't do Janelle any justice tbh".  LandonKidatrea compares it to the original as well, saying "not as good as the original. All hail our glorious mod JanelleMonae".  mother_rucker says, "The original is 1000x better and 1,000,000x more fun."

eklxtreme says, "melancholic feel, not too impressive, pretty ordinary, best part is the lowkey guitar".  
yatcho "ummmmmmm..."

JoshuaReddit says: 

>Who thought it was a good idea to take such a soulful bop from the most talented popheads moderator and strip away all of its energy with a dreadfully slow and monotone vocal performance?

Others judge the song more based on its own merits, and still find that it doesn't hold up.  eklxtreme says, "melancholic feel, not too impressive, pretty ordinary, best part is the lowkey guitar".  yatcho can only manage "ummmmmmm..."  Hellomochi says "Seems like she's gasping and can't keep up with the beat, her voice works with the music though."  

supremeshieldon says "this song really doesn't work for Lauren tbh, still pretty ok though".  TeamAwesome4 agrees, "repeated syllables do not become Lauren".

However, a few were able to appreciate this gentrified mess, earning this song both the lowest average score and the **highest controversy score** of the rate.  mindnoises says "Decent cover song".  tipttt284 says "It's probably my favorite cover ever. I love how Chvrches chage the tone so drastically without it feeling completely empty like every wite white guy with an accoustic guitar singing like they're in pain."  spacebabe27 says, "CHVRCHES doing Janelle is everything I could ask for".

Altiondsols: #\#40 - You Caught The Light (5.77)

Controversy: 2.47

High scores: Awhile2 - 9

Low scores: eykitsa - 1, eklxtreme - 2

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOX4RxptkIs)

The biggest criticism of this song is that it's boring.  Boring enough that virtually nobody even commented on it, just dropped their 3 or 4 and slammed that forward button

eklxtreme says, "I hate when the closing tracks are just boring slow songs like this, takes almost 2 mins for the vocals to start, at least it feels uplifting".  mindnoises agrees, "The song is too slow for me and drags on too long."  yatcho says, "It's crazy how much better High Enough to Carry You Over is than either of these".  TeamAwesome4 also complains about the length, saying "This is the one track I like to skip every time, and it doesn’t help that it’s the longest one."  mother_rucker says, "it's sounds nice but not in a way that's interesting".  

LandonKidatrea says "oh hi Martin".  spacebabe27 says "Very M83 to me".

Like with Tightrope, supremeshieldon somehow speaks favorably of this song: "this is a lot better than I remembered it being".

swbrontosaur: Listening to this song now for the first time since the album came out, and taken completely out of context it really is quite lovely.  I am not comparing the male singer to the female singer, and his voice does have a nice quality in this languid, defeated, mopey kind of track.  I like the crunchyness of the distortion.  A little too Colplay maybe at times, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.  I can see putting this on repeat on a rainey day and just trying to numb out, but secretly wallowing in some personal misery.

Good way to end an album.

As FuckUpSomeCommasYeah puts it:

>never let anyone other than Lauren sing.

This is the mistake that earned Chvrches two of their Major Flop slots.

LandonKidatrea:

>I wasn’t expecting Doherty to sing in this album…. He’s not very good is he?

yatcho: 

>The Martin tracks on this album are tragic but at least it sounds cool  

mother_rucker:

>Lauren Mayberry should be the only one singing CHVRCHES songs tbh

eklxtreme: 

>his vocals don't have much personality and they kinda just blend in with the already toned down instrumental, slightly picks up when the bright synths and the drums start.  

ThereIsNoSantaClaus:

>not as big a fan of songs with the male vocalist. it's not a bad song by any means just one of my least favorite on here. Lauren Mayberry >>>

Oh, and also this one is boring too apparently.

TeamAwesome4:

>Chvrches songs seem empty without a ridiculously high pitched 12 year old on the track.

supremeshieldon (who praised both of the other two 1-magnets from Chvrches) says "it's just kind of ok I guess? I mean there's nothing outstanding about it but it's pretty good".  hellomochi agrees and says, "Lyrics are kinda shallow for a song titled Under The Tide."

tipttt284 says, "The voice is okay, the music isn't as much."  spacebabe27 says "filler af".

Altiondsols: #\#38 - Vagabond (5.93)

Controversy: 1.88

High scores: LandonKidatrea - 10

Low scores: eykitsa - 2, Awhile2 - 3

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KlCBRHpDxo)

yatcho:

>album is dragging tbh

This song's biggest failure is probably its placement.  The beginning of the album is very upbeat and happy, but by the time the album reaches a little past the halfway mark it starts to slow down and drag a bit.  By the time you make it to this, the second to last track, most listeners were exhausted and bored. 

hellomochi says, "This song doesn't peak, not even at the chorus."  TeamAwesome4 says "“Pretending to not feel alone” is stupidly relatable, but I don’t really like the rest of this."

However, unlike the other Major Flops, this song did have at least a few nice comments.

eklxtreme says, "the melody is nice, the silent parts are good, not much else".  mindnoises said "maritime sounding grower".  LandonKidatrea praises the song, saying "Mandy Lee’s voice is heavenly. That is all."

eklxtreme says, "party in the usa intro, kinda funky, the chorus is so basic".  mindnoises says "Good mood music".  

A major complaint on this track was Mandy's vocals.  yatcho says "She's kind of really annoying on this one?"

However, mother_rucker praised Mandy, saying "I'm very into what she does with her voice on this song."

I didn't feel comfortable being the only person to see a running total of all of the scores and be able to submit my own as well, especially since a lot of the higher songs were so unbelievably close and I didn't have a ton of participants.

THIS BAND INCAPABLE OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN STUPID HAPPY CHEERINESS??????

For a song so low on the list, it wasn't particularly controversial.  There weren't a lot of zeroes; most people just really felt that it was a 6.5ish.  Even eykitsa, who gave every single other song from Our Own House a 2, felt that this was a bit more average.  This song had sort of the same pitfall as Vagabond; this song is way too deep into the slower half of the album.

There was some praise, like eklxtreme who said "very chill and beautiful at the verses, drumming is good".  yatcho thought the song was "cute".  

Then, some criticism.  mindnoises says "The beginning of the song is nice and promising, but when the chorus starts, it gets too cheesy, especially the beat. What is this? A kid show's theme song? Totally annoying to me."  TwentyOneParrots asks "THIS BAND INCAPABLE OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN STUPID HAPPY CHEERINESS??????"

Our first Purity Ring song knocked out.  The consensus was that it was a bit too slow to close out the album.

eklxtreme says "the synths are decent, the vocals are kinda boring, the song doesn't do much for me".  hellomochi says "I like the production, but it doesn't stand out."

HowDoIWhat: Serious answer to probably joke question:

I think they do it as part of an active effort to avoid having what happens to a lot of female vocalist/male instrumentalist bands where the girl kind of gets shoved in front all the time and the dudes fade into obscurity. I mean, they're pretty adamant about how all three are equal contributors to the band in a couple of the interviews I've read.

Then again, I'm not sure how successful this effort has been, since I've talked to some people who thought Chvrches was just Lauren's stage name, or just see Chvrches as "Waifu Lavren, Man With Hat and Man Without Hat."

mindnoises was more critical, saying "Massive sound, but I don't really like the vibes. A bit boring and mediocre."  Most of the other h8rs left it with no comment.

hellomochi: I think the reason why MisterWives did so poorly so early is that people went into this rate expecting all synthpop bands. They're definitely different from Purity Ring and Chvrches. :o

I still love them the most out of the three.
[/r/popheads/comments/55qfet/rate_results_the_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our/d8dalji/]

=====

LandonKidatrea: 

I was wondering about why they got such low scores as well. My theory is that ~~too many people in this sub have awful taste~~ the people who liked CHVRCHES/purity ring gave their songs high scores, then listened to Misterwives, disliked it, and then gave their songs 1/2/3's out of 10. But the people who liked Misterwives and disliked the other two still tried to find some positives and some stuff they liked about the other albums so they gave the songs like 4 or 5 on average even if they didn't like the songs. Maybe that's just the kind of people that Misterwives attracts ;) Or maybe I'm just salty lol

In any case it makes me wonder what the rate would have looked like if we had to rate three synthpop bands instead of two synthpop bands and *those other guys.* Of course I probably would never have listened to Misterwives if that were the case, and that's not a world I wanna live in.

hellomochi: I've actually liked Misterwives for a while now and have only ever heard of Chvrches by the name, but I haven't heard any of their songs before (I honestly thought they were an alt-rock band). This is also the first time I've ever heard of purity thing. However...*HOWEVER*, I still rated all three bands as fair as I could, each of them getting high and low scores. So yeah, I'm also really salty right now.

I'm glad you were able to discover to discover a new band to love though. :)
