eklxtreme:

>not very interesting, everything is just okay

tipttt284 agrees, saying "too repetitive and the lyrics aren't very interesting."  mindnoises as well says "I like the sounds, but it doesn't tap its full potential".

TeamAwesome4 asks, "WHAT IS THAT IRRITATING SOUND GOING THROUGH THE ENTIRE SONG? If you have something that omnipresent, it needs to be awesome, not the sound of a jammed printer."

mother_rucker says "IIRC, this was the first song released pre-album. I liked it more then than I do now."

This was the **least controversial song** of the entire rate thread.

mother_rucker:

>honestly kind of boring

spacebabe27 says "Forgetful bop tbh."  supremeshieldon agrees, "don't really care for this song but it's still quite good".  eklxtreme says "melody is great and that sea of synths is great, wish the lyrics were better."

TeamAwesome4 says "Lack the punch of other songs on the album. Also why didn’t they change the chorus to “For all time” from “for always”? Same meaning, same syllables, and it almost rhymes. Always bothered me a bit."

mindnoises says "This hurts my ears, even in Chvrches' measures too synth-heavy. Song is okay though".

On the other hand, hellomochi says "Love those clap thingies in the chorus."

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg7MAacSPNM)

spacebabe27:

>Lauren could have had more prominent vocals in this, and the beat could have a harder more defined rhythm

Main issue with this song is that it's boring and Lavren isn't in it a ton.

yatcho says "they've really sharpened their sound since this."

It had some fans though, which is why it was so controversial.

TeamAwesome4 says "What a lovely singing voice she must have. Too bad it’s barely in this song, but it’s still the first time I really like Chvrches without her taking the lead."  supremeshieldon agrees, saying "Seemed like another boring song at first but damn it really gets better after that first chorus".  mindnoises says "Amazing build-up. Edgy and atmospheric. Loving these dark unusual harmonies."  eklxtreme agrees saying "both vocals do well here, the production is decent".

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HJry8wH5T0)

supremeshieldon asks (about the track's exclusion), "and why wasn't this on it either?"

TeamAwesome4 says "This is a cute little bop. :D"  mindnoises agrees "nice one".  eklxtreme likes it as well, "this synth intro is very different, the verses are pretty quiet but it’s done well, this chorus hits hard cus of the bass, more of that interesting synth".

However, hellomochi says "Feels like a filler song."

eklxtreme:

>criminally underrated and epic, sets a perfect atmospheric, lush, night vibe until...........BCJQPNDHFURYESYES IT JUST KILLS ME

TeamAwesome4:

>It’s a real shame this song takes two and a half minutes to begin to interest me, because the rest of it is really nice.

supremeshieldon agrees, saying "the first half just kind of bores me, it gets somewhat better towards the end".  TwentyOneParrots says "I love Chvrches but this song almost rings hollow, like it's missing its emotional core? They definitely do loud and fast and angry more consistently than they do soft and mellow. The outro is banging though".

However, hellomochi says "The bridge is a B O P."  ThereIsNoSantaClaus agrees, saying "loved this song. a lot of CHVRCHES songs have a more fast-paced approach, but this one took a really good slow burn style with muted but well done instrumentation. it feels like a really good movie score."

mindnoises says "Great build-up in the chorus. I like the guitars. The drums are a bit too "fat" for that 80s sound. That climax at the end tho!"  yatcho agrees too, saying "Purely for the drop at the end that gets me every time".

TeamAwesome4:

>What the fuck is this? This is not a song, this is a lyrical assassination captured in audio form. RIP whoever the target was, cuz this shit is lethal. “Your heart's just an organ that pumps nothing more than blood to your vainful veins” is SO perfect, I really cannot get over it.

Shame it just barely made it in the top half then

hellomochi says "Another song that's all over the place, but the lyrics redeem it."  yatcho praises the lyrics as well, saying "Bonus points just for the "youre an ASShole".  

eklxtreme says "this subtle guitar and percussion is so nice, catchy song".  supremeshieldon agrees, "ok why wasn't this on the album".  

However, mindnoises says "sounds rather dull".  

#\#19 - Best I Can Do (7.23)

hellomochi agrees, saying "Starts mellow then builds up to an explosive chorus. Love it."  yatcho also says "The most energy out of all these songs, love it".

TeamAwesome4 says "Don’t lie, Misterwives, this isn’t the best you can do. It’s still pretty good though."  mindnoises says "This song is kinda cute but the use of brass is just too much."

Controversy: 1.72

High scores: skiddos - 10, LandonKidatrea, supremeshieldon - 9

Low scores: eykitsa - 2, tipttt284 - 4

A lot of the commenters mentioned the slow part in the last prechorus:

mindnoises:

>At first listen I didn't like this song at all. I thought it was overproduced. I didn't like the brass. It sounded like The Cranberries on speed. And I hated this "Come on Eileen" part near the end. But after a few listens it totally grew on me and now I think it's a banger.

Altiondsols: #\#17 - Lungs (7.30)

Low scores: zombastesese - 0, Awhile2 - 4

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Ujua6a82c)

For a song that ranked relatively high, a ton of people thought it was a snoozefest (including me)

eklxtreme says "the very beginning vocal sample is cool, I like Lauren's layered vocals, the synth riff at the end of the chorus is the best part, the song as a whole is not that exciting though".  yatcho agrees, "the only Lauren song I can call a meh".  mindnoises as well, "I'm bored by this song but I like the instrumental parts".  

On the other hand, whatsapilot says "kinda weird compared to the other songs. Sort of out of place in this album. Well, I like that."  supremeshieldon as well says "love the production and really everything on this song".  TeamAwesome4 says  "I love this song. I love the honesty behind Lauren to whoever about how she’s in total control straight to their face."

letsallpoo says "This sounds like a Poppy track. (Not a good thing.)" and is terribly misguided, someday he will learn the errors of his ways

ThereIsNoSantaClaus:

>Such an interesting song. My favorite on this album. I loved the blasting instrumental, the vocal melodies, and the pulsating lowkey beat during the verses that builds to the chorus. A great electronic song above all.

eklxtreme starts us off with "not interesting, the vocals and synths are bland".  TeamAwesome4 agrees "not digging this one much at all."  

However, spacebabe27 says "If this bass doesn't make you wanna break shit then you're a pussy."  tipttt284 says "The music is very rich and textured and it has power without overpowering the lyrics."  hellomochi agrees "The lyrics say "come hither" but in a weird way."

>You have to wait for it but then it's mind-blowing. 1:50 in and I literally start to cry for joy!

eklxtreme agrees that it's slow to start:

>takes very long for the song to start, but when it does it's just okay, we get it; you weren't thinking about that person

TwentyOneParrots, on the other hand, says "yo i'm fucking digging this intro".

eklxtreme:

>I love the mix of the huge synths, percussion, and vocal sample. Lauren doesn't quite outshine the instrumental and she's kinda there to provide a melody

mindnoises agrees, saying "More banger than I remembered. The production is almost too heavy."

On the other hand, TeamAwesome4:

>The only time Lauren’s vocal tones are more threatening than her lyrics, a nice change of pace.

mother_rucker, who gave his 11, says "I LOVE THIS SONG. It's so powerful and the beat is everything."  supremeshieldon says "same as Gun I just like the verses a bit more."

MrSwearword: Gurl, Azealia Banks sold more copies than Misterwives. Outselling Misterwives is like saying you ordered a Big Mac from McDonald's; you're not the first to do it and you won't be the last for a long while.

eykitsa: Same here. I thought Purity Ring would've been 1989'd but Misterwives ended up Misterwives'd.

LandonKidatrea: Two of the three bands in the rate have flairs in this sub. This fight did NOT start on equal footing. Misterwives better get a fucking flair after this.

TeamAwesome4: I'd probably still rock the Kesha flair, but I'd LOVE to see some treehouses with colorful animals falling out of it all over the sub.

eykitsa: I had hoped, but in the announcement thread, not a lot of people were saying many positive things about Purity Ring, but that was just a very vocal minority.

Altiondsols: 28 iirc

Not nearly as many as the first one, but that was to be expected tbh

TeamAwesome4: Hard to tell, you'd need to ask /u/letsallpoo 

I can tell you, 14 people gave Run Away With Me an 11, and 35 gave it a 10.  So a lot, lot more.
[/r/popheads/comments/55wh28/rate_results_the_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our/d8efdy7/]

letsallpoo: exactly 80
[/r/popheads/comments/55wh28/rate_results_the_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our/d8efivw/]

TeamAwesome4: Shit, that means over 50% of people gave RAWM a 10 or higher.

Also, thanks for answering the call <3

LandonKidatrea: oh wow. And here I was thinking that maybe if I had voted Taylor wouldn't have been so thoroughly demolished. Now I don't feel as bad for not participating

eykitsa: Now I feel bad.
[/r/popheads/comments/55wh28/rate_results_the_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our/d8ef5jk/]

=====

Altiondsols: it's ok lmao, you rated most of the other stuff pretty low too so it wasn't a huge issue 

the real problem was that basically everyone only gave scores in between like a 7 and a 9, with a 5 being Very Bad, so since your scores were distributed a lot wider they sort of had a bigger impact on the average 
[/r/popheads/comments/55wh28/rate_results_the_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our/d8efzvf/]

=====

eykitsa: Lol, I was sorted into Slytherin, so I don't feel *that* bad, but I thought more people would give more varied responses. 


See, this is why I'd never host a rate, that's too much fucking math to solve.

thegeecyproject: Predictions for the order of top 10? I feel like The Mother We Share is #1 and begin again (or some other Purity Ring song) is #2. Misterwives' last song might just touch the top 5 like Swift did last time.
[/r/popheads/comments/55wh28/rate_results_the_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our/d8edfo8/]

TeamAwesome4: Prediction:

1. Mother We Share

2. Gun

3. Flood on the Floor

4. Heartsigh

5. Recover

6. Reflections

7. Begin Again

8. Bodyache

9. Our Own House

10. Night Sky

Hopes:

1. Reflections

2. Gun

3. Our Own House

4. The Mother We Share

5. Heartsigh

6. Flood on the Floor

7. Bodyache

8. Recover

9. Night Sky

10. Begin Again

=====

chihuahuazero: Purity Ring and Chvrches really trampled MisterWives. On one hand, we should probably avoid such a situation in the future so one album doesn't absorb all the low scores due to not clicking with fans of the other two albums.

On the other hand, blood.
