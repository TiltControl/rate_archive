[RATE] Bones Of What You Believe vs Our Own House vs another eternity
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/51cjp8/rate_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our_own_house/

Welcome to the second /r/popheads rate, Indiepop edition! Like [the previous rate thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4xmic6/rate_1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman/), we're going to all get together and score each song off of each of three albums.  It's the back-to-school season, and what better way to look like a Cool Kid than by namedropping some indie pop bands that "you've probably never heard of"?  Perfect for impressing people you don't care about, which is half of the point of high school.

Rules are the same as the first time around, but here's a refresher:

1. Listen to the songs below.  Links provided whenever possible.

2. Rate each song from 1 to 10, 1 being awful and 10 being perfect.  You can also give ONE eleven and ONE zero, to your favorite and least favorite songs respectively (across your entire scoring, not per album).  If you want, you can leave comments alongside your scores, and they will be revealed along with the songs.

3. PM your scores to /u/Altiondsols (that me), along with any comments you'd wish to add.  You can copy and paste the lists into a Word doc/Notepad/whatever, add your scores, and send them to me.  Your scores and comments should *not* be considered anonymous.

4. The scores will be revealed in order from lowest to highest.

5. Everyone is perfectly fine because no one here has any actual emotional attachment to some silly contest like this, everyone acts like adults and no one cries when their indie princess completely tanks, we all get along with no issues whatsoever unlike last time

The three albums we're going to look at this time around are:

**Chvrches - The Bones of What You Believe**

vs

**Misterwives - Our Own House**

vs

**Purity Ring - another eternity**

So, it's been a few hours since the last subwide rate ended meaning it's time we get started

#Chvrches - The Bones of What You Believe

Since these groups aren't as well-known as pop princesses/queens Taylor, Ari, and Carly, this will also be an informative post.  Learnin' and shit.

Guitarist [Iain Cook](http://i.imgur.com/7mMYjoa.jpg) and synth [Martin Doherty](http://i.imgur.com/kDJ95Sa.jpg) went to vniversity together, and presumably met lead vocalist [Lauren Mayberry](http://i.imgur.com/jmglk8u.jpg) at a local middle school.  Iain and Martin asked [Lavren](http://i.imgur.com/Y2ayhYV.jpg) to provide vocals for some demos they were making, and decided to form a band in 2011 when the demos were successful.  They chose the band name "**CHVRCHΞS**" because they liked the sound, not for any religious reasons, with a "V" to distingvish them from the actual bvildings in search engines.  

In November of 2012, the band released their first single, The Mother We Share.  The following February, they released a second single Recover, and two months later they released it again in the three-track Recover ΞP.  A third single, Gun, released in July of 2013.  Two more months after that, they released their debut studio album, **The Bones of What You Believe**.  The album is largely synthpop, with indiepop, dance, and electronica elements, combining Lavren Mayberry's steady, confident vocals, 80s-inspired drums, and extreme energy synth layers.  

Metacritic's aggregated score for the albvm is 80, indicating generally favorable reviews.  The group has gained popularity among indie circles, with Lauren Mayberry becoming an indie icon despite [being literally twelve years old](http://i.imgur.com/ndWlurV.jpg).  I refuse to believe that [this girl](http://imgur.com/ctrkDLt) is 28 years old, and she's definitely too young to have a Masters degree.  Some kind of witchcraft Benjamin Bvtton nonsense.  Anyway, here's the track list, [listen to all of these and vote](http://i.imgur.com/cgjvozY.gif)

1. The Mother We Share

3. Gun

4. Tether

#MISTERWIVES - Our Own House

Lead singer Mandy Lee originally partnered with musicians Etienne Bowler and William Hehir to make an 80s cover band for a birthday party.  The group expanded to include Jesse Blum and Marc Campbell, playing their first show under the name "**Misterwives**".  The name is a reference to "sister wives" practice of polygamy, as Lee is the sole female member of the group.  The entire band lives together in an apartment in the Bronx, which is the house referenced in the name of the album "**Our Own House**".  [\(Yes, they were being painfully literal.\)](http://i.imgur.com/IX8wYim.png)

All of Misterwives' songs are written by Mandy Lee herself, and then she goes downstairs to pitch them to the rest of the band.  In general, the group is very proud of their cohesion and togetherness, often referring to themselves as a family and being just sickeningly positive and happy all of the time.  They're so sappy and sentimental that they named their tour ["The Scrapbook Tour"](http://i.imgur.com/NytnYeM.jpg), using a literal pink sprinkly donut for the O.

If all of this is giving you the feeling that you just [bit off a massive chunk of one of these](http://i.imgur.com/EF8RxFm.jpg) and washed it down with red cream soda, that's basically what you can expect from their actual music.  "Our Own House" is an explosion of energy, drawing heavy influences from ska as well as funk and R&B.  The band uses everything from blaring brass to gentle guitars to oddly-fitting accordions, but Mandy Lee's operatic voice doesn't struggle to keep up.  It's over-the-top and perfectly aware of it, like a retro comic book converted into music.

Our Own House and the Reflections EP are both currently not even listed on Metacritic, nor has P4K reviewed them (although they have been featured in an article).  That counts for like double indie cred

Anyway, here's the track list:

1. Our Own House

2. Not Your Way

3. Reflections

4. Oceans

5. Best I Can Do

6. Hurricane

7. Coffins

8. No Need For Dreaming

9. Box Around the Sun

10. Imagination Infatuation

11. Vagabond

12. Queens

13. Twisted Tongue

14. Kings and Queens

#PURITY RING - another eternity

Megan James and Corin Roddick met while playing in the band Born Gold, with Megan on piano and Roddick on drums.  Roddick experiemented with electronic music and production while on tour, and he was asked to help with a track named "Ungirthed".  The side project developed into the much larger electronic duo **Purity Ring**, and the track was used on their debut album "Shrines".  Neither Megan nor Corin play the same instruments that they did in Born Gold, with Megan now doing vocals for Corrin's varied instrumentals.  Purity Ring is currently signed to independent record label 4AD, [the same label that Grimes is signed to](http://i.imgur.com/1GXgSem.png)

The duo keeps a meticulous amount of control over their image, sound, and performances: Corin controls light and sound for their live performances while on the stage, using [some horrifying custom-built contraption](http://i.imgur.com/JEulC2M.jpg) that is [beyond the realm of human understanding](http://i.imgur.com/jRvuHKZ.jpg).  Somehow even more impressive, Megan sews all of the clothes they wear on stage.

This kind of control, this pristine perfection is exactly what to expect going into their second album, **another eternity**.  For an album combining so many varied influences, from electronic and indie to R&B and hip hop, and even some more industrial sounds, the album still sounds very cohesive, like it's just one "thing" instead of a bunch of scattered bits.

Megan's lyrics on another eternity reflect the same odd fixation on bodily imagery and very tactile language [like this](http://i.imgur.com/9vLI6fA.png) that we heard from her on Shrines.  Wait, what?  A strange fixation on bodies?  Inhuman levels of precision and control?  A song titled "stranger than earth"?  *Associated with Grimes???* Back up a second, are we sure that [the album cover](http://i.imgur.com/pZqBx2R.png) isn't a woman being abducted?  

[The real aliens](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4bd17l/is_here_by_alessia_cara_about_aliens/) were right under our noses this entire time, obviously using creative peach-colored lighting and distortive fabrics to mask their true otherworldly nature

1. heartsigh

2. bodyache

3. push pull

4. repetition

5. stranger than earth

6. begin again

7. dust hymn

8. flood on the floor

9. sea castle

10. stillness in woe
