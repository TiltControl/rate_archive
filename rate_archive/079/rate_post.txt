#Hello fellow depressed people! 

Thank you for joining me and /u/FranklyTheTurtle for enjoying the **Mid 2010's Synth Pop Rock Rate!!!** We will be rating *Strange Desire* by Bleachers,  *Every Open Eye* by CHVRCHES, and finally, *I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it* [takes breath] by The 1975. Each of these albums are known for their combination of pop rock and synth pop. Some definitely lean more into one aspect than others, but all are incredible records that really should be enjoyed. Whether you're a fan of all of these records, one of them, or maybe even none of them, we both think you'll all find something great about each one of them and hope you give them a fair chance!

# [Bleachers - Strange Desire](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hqdxFBNGL._SL1500_.jpg)

Our first album is by a band that has already won a rate! Bleachers (deservedly) won the [Moody 2017 Band Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ai0cv7/moody_2017_band_rate_reveal_day_3_whats_wrong/eekcras/) with Don't Take The Money. Strange Desire is an album that lead singer Jack Antonoff has often described as being inspired by the angst and color of John Hughes' movies. Strange Desire is filled to the brim with meaningful lyrics and very emotive performances by Jack. Whether it's the rush of introspection on I Wanna Get Better or the outpouring of love on You're Still a Mystery, you can always expect energy, emotion, and some personal lyrics about confusion, loss, regret, and anything else that'll keep you awake at night. The album is a little rough around the edges, but that helps give it character and shows how raw the album truly is. 

1. Wild Heart  
2. Rollercoaster  
3. Shadow  
4. I Wanna Get Better  
5. Wake Me  
6. Reckless Love  
7. Take Me Away (ft. Grimes)  
8. Like a River Runs  
9. You're Still a Mystery  
10. I'm Ready to Move On/Wild Heart Reprise (ft. Yoko Ono)
11. Who I Want You to Love



# [CHVRCHES - Every Open Eye](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/09/14/chvrches_everyopeneye_sq-252b652c5690f074c210cbe166dfb7edfc26028e-s800-c85.jpg) 

Our next album is also by a band who has won a rate! CHVRCHES won the [Indiepop Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/51cjp8/rate_bones_of_what_you_believe_vs_our_own_house/) three years ago with The Mother We Share. Every Open Eye is the second album from the Scotish indiepop trio, released in 2015. The album follows many of the themes of their debut, mainly relationships and heartbreak. Every Open Eye, however, is more refined and much more slick than their last album. The production and the writing has become sharper than before, and it shows, especially on songs like Leave a Trace and Afterglow. The writing paints great pictures of anger and sorrow from a relationship that failed, even showing both sides of it in songs like High Enough To Carry You Over. Every Open Eye is the cleanest of the three albums, but it still manages to retain it's humanity and emotion.

1. Never Ending Circles  
2. Leave a Trace  
3. Keep You on My Side  
4. Make Them Gold  
5. Clearest Blue  
6. High Enough to Carry You Over  
7. Empty Threat  
8. Down Side of Me  
9. Playing Dead  
10. Bury It  
11. Afterglow  
12. Get Away  
13. Follow You  
14. Bow Down  
15. Warning Call (Theme from Mirror's Edge Catalyst)

# [The 1975 - i like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it](http://images.genius.com/75e00924380679580e1eec2518036101.1000x1000x1.jpg)

Our last album is from The 1975, Who was also in a Rate before... *I like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it* is an album full of punch-your-tv obnoxiously terrible high pitched vocals singing unconvincing emo lyrics it is an album full of frustration, love, introspection and narcissism. Ditching the black and white of their last album they go for something much more bright and much more 80's. From the Sunday morning choir anthem "If I Believe You" to the shoegazy trance that is "Lostmyhead" to the dripping shades of pop perfection with "The Sound"  to soul crushing indie pop in "Somebody Else" This is The 1975 at their most eclectic and vibrant fine tuning their mythos and aesthetic they have built purely for themselves. I like it when you sleep... Is a mosaic of passions that are stained in the soft pink neon glow of city lights that shine through stained glass windows and on nascent bedroom walls that have been left empty in favor of cleaning up a bottle of red wine that was shattered during dinner.

1. The 1975  
2. Love Me  
3. Ugh!  
4. A Change of Heart  
5. She's American  
6. If I Believe You  
7. Please Be Naked  
8. Lostmyhead  
9. The Ballad of Me and My Brain  
10. Somebody Else  
11. Loving Someone  
12. I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It  
13. The Sound  
14. This Must Be My Dream  
15. Paris  
16. Nana  
17. She Lays Down

#Bonus Rate

We *could* rate different songs from throwaway singles, covers, collabs, soundtracks, etc. and then when you're racing to finish the rate, you realize you have the bonus rate left so you don't even have time for it. But you know what? Fuck that. Let's add some extra fun into this bonus rate. And guess what? You won't even need to listen to any extra songs to have some fun with the bonus rate! 

When you think of all these albums, you think of synth pop, introspect, amazing vocals, stunning hooks, and aesthetic as fuck things. But, what about if you just think about titles of the albums? That's right, this bonus rate is inspired by the bonus rate of the 2015 Alt Pop Rate by /u/Therokinrolla and /u/1998tweety! Each title has different ways of interpreting it into unusual things we can rate, so we decided to go with some of the weirdest and best categories of things. Also, **you have to do the main rate to do this bonus rate**. We ain't making any exceptions for anyone. Anyway, Category Is... (I mean Categories are)

Fetishes (*Strange Desire*)  
1. Foot Fetish  
2. Bondage  
3. Voyeurism  
4. Role Play  
5. Tentacles  
6. Cuckholding  
7. Vore  
8. Masochism  
9. Sadism  
10. Forniphilia  
11. Asphyxiation  

Forms of Visual Media (*Every Open Eye*)  
1. Typography  
2. Informational Graphs  
3. Animated Cartoons  
4. Photography  
5. Motion Pictures (movies)  
6. Television  
7. Video Games  
8. Art  
9. Music Videos  
10. Pornography  
11. Theater

Common Dreams (*i like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it*)  
1. Falling  
2. Teeth Falling Out  
3. Going to School Naked  
4. Taking Tests  
5. Dying  
6. Lucid Dreaming  
7. Being Chased  
8. Flying  
9. Being Pregnant  
10. Driving an Out-Of-Control Vehicle  
11. Seeing Carly Rae Jepsen murder a man in a dark alley at night, and she comes up to you and tells you, "If you tell anyone about this, I'm not releasing my cancelled disco album, Disco Sweat." You nod to her in agreement (duh) and she smiles at you and hands you a bloody knife. The cops roll up and you are arrested for the murder of the man, later revealed to be Kevin Jonas. While in court, you are faced with the dilemma of taking the fall for Carly, or, never getting the opportunity to hear Disco Sweat in high-quality audio (cause you listened to the leak already, but that was only 3 songs and one snippet at like 128 kbps).

Again, the bonus rate is OPTIONAL, you do NOT need to complete it to send in scores

# Da Rules, please follow them

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots. This means that giving a 7 is fine! Giving a 7.5 is fine! Giving a 7.55 is absolutely out of the question!

* You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11.** By one, we mean that this is **one song total, not one song per album.** Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results and is very annoying!

* You may NOT give your 0/11 to a bonus rate song. No, it doesn't matter how much you enjoy feet, you can't give it your 11.

* You have to listen to and rank each song! This rate has some high-quality tracks, listen to them all!

* Your scores are confidential until the reveal date. Your scores WILL be visible for anyone to check whenever we reveal!

* If we suspect you from intentionally giving certain songs or artists low scores for the sake of sabotage, we will not hesitate to tell you to clarify or change your scores!

* Your scores can be changed at any time! Just PM the corrections to /u/ImADudeDuh or /u/FranklyTheTurtle!

If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Like this:

# THIS IS THE CORRECT FORMAT TO SUBMIT:

> Wild Heart: 8 Simon deserved better in Love, Simon!

# THESE ARE WRONG, LITERALLY ANY FORMAT THAT IS NOT LIKE ABOVE IS WRONG:

> Wild Heart - 8 Simon deserved better in Love, Simon!  
> Wild Heart 8 Simon deserved better in Love, Simon!  
> Wild Heart: Simon deserved better in Love, Simon! 8  
> Wild Heart: 8/10 Simon deserved better in Love, Simon!  
> Wild Heart: eight. Simon deserved better in Love, Simon!  
> Wild Heart: Simon deserved better in Love, Simon, and for that reason, my official score for Wild Heart by Bleachers on their album Strange Desire gets an 8.0 out of a possible score of 10.0. Thank you.  

If you do that last one, we reserve the right to drive to your house and insult you to your face.

You can also comments on the albums as a whole by adding a colon after the title:

> Album: I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it: Great album, annoying title!

# Again, to comment on an album, just do the thing above. Just add a colon after the album title.
