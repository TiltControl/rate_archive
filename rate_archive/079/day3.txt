Also yes, if not obvious, Clearest Blue for the win!

Seriously though, have you guys heard that bridge, its amazing. To be honest all the bridges in EOE are amazing, but this one in particular. Yet it was ranked #33. You guys don't deserve Lauren, Ian, or Martin!

**1998tweety** (7): meh

**vayyiqra** (7): If this means the written word as a whole, I have to rate it highly since it's so important to human history, but strictly speaking typography means the boring technical stuff about printing and fonts etc. That kind of thing is alright to me though, since I have a liking for writing systems and glyphs and so on. But printing itself is fairly boring, I'm afraid.

**Franklytheturtle** (8): The version with Hayley is the alpha version

---

#Rise above it!

**jexan13** (10): I really love when the instrumental has a personality on its own. This song starts, you hear the riff and you know a bop is coming. And an explosive bop comes. It's nothing but Pop Perfection. The chorus, the prechorus and the verses are incredible. The energy never stops, it justs keeps on building. I want those damn synths to top me. Under any other circunstances this would have been my 11, but the competition was so damn tough.

**jimmy345960** (10): WOW another eleven contender. I literally remember walking home to this in the New York winters and be so depressed over a break up I desperately wanted to get over that I would walk in a T-shirt (for less than a minute). Man its explosive, love it.

**Trevsauce88** (10): album highlight

**vayyiqra** (10): BURY IT! BURY IT! AND RISE ABOVE! :kimbryell:

**camerinian** (9.5): This should have been a huge fucking hit are you kidding me what a massive bop

**saviorARMY101** (9): The production on this might me some of the best on the whole album. The song is very catchy and it's a bop and although its kind of repititive, but I don't mind it since its so catchy. A bop definitely.

**1998tweety** (8.5): HillBillie is shook at this a bit

**waluigiest** (8): this is tasty! Good lyrical content and heavy synths.

**slimboyfriend (7.5): This song makes me feel like I'm grinding levels in a video game**

**modulum83** (7.3): The 80s new wave vibes are strong with this one

#Bury this song omg my ears

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): oop

**frogaranaman** (6): me when [REDACTED]

**InternetDude19** (6): It is catchy, but it kind of annoys me too.

**gannade** (0): bury this song omg my ears

#I wanted paraMORE

**bespectacIed** (9): I prefer this over the hayley williams remix which in retrospect seems like a fever dream to me. The lyrics are a bit thin but the song's a bop

**gwenflip** (9): but it would be an 10 if we included the Hayley Williams bonus track version

**bandnitos** (7): this is filler it really is lacking without hayley's feature

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (7): A bop, but I wish we were rating the version with Hayley Williams in it

**CarlieScion** (6): the hayley version outsold

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): where is hayley williams

**Franklytheturtle** (8): Sometimes I think this is the most underrated 1975 song made. Sometimes it's just okay. This song has all the magic of Ballad Of Me And My Brain and all the shimmering nostalgic feelings of The Sound and the fun delivery and beat of every other song on the album. But still it's just missing something that's stopping it from being God tier 1975.

---

#I must be dreaming, cause this is great

**CarlieScion** (10): this is euphoria

**frogaranaman** (10): me @ every single “straight” guy that hits on me

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): What a blessing.

**1998tweety** (8.5): CUte

**modulum83** (8.5): so unapologetically cheesy-80s-ballad - yet so good

**bandnitos** (8): this is fun but sometimes a shorter runtime is better

**bespectacIed** (8): gorgeous

**jexan13** (8): It's very catchy, but it's not too interesting. Maybe because this is where you start to think "when will it end". Also the instrumental doesn't feel "new" after the other songs.

**saviorARMY101** (8): I love how 80s this sounds. This is definitely very catchy and the production is really nice, though a little repititive. Still great though.

#This must be a nightmare

**gannade** (5.5): last minute was cute

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha (5): i can’t even think of a witty comment to write on this song that’s how little this interests me**

**Trevsauce88** (5): meh

#*Intro to Run Away With Me plays*

**skargardin** (10): It's quite simple, if you've got a song with a sax solo, you get full marks.

**camerinian** (9.5): Not gonna lie I didn't really pay a lot of attention to this song before since it's stashed at the end of a very, very long album, but holy SHIT. This is such a fucking vibe. I love that sax like nothing else.

**InternetDude19** (9): Much better than I remembered, irresistible sax.

**waluigiest** (8): [sax solo]

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Oh thank God there's a saxophone

**vayyiqra** (6): Eh it's okay but that sax solo is giving me "background music for shopping in a Zellers in 1996" vibes yes I know this is incredibly specific

**Franklytheturtle** (10): I don't think I see this song get talked about as much as the others but this is the song that made me fall in love with this album. Laurens strong and crystalline vocals. The immaculate production. It's monolithic and shiny like a crystal. Maybe this isn't the BEST song on this album and you could say most of these things about most of the songs on the album but I struggled to find a way in which it could get more perfect.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): An album opener. Never Ending Circles does a great job at showing what you can expect from the album. A song that shows a relationship that is just about to reach a breaking point, it’s sharp, it’s angry, it’s very CHVRCHES. He was rude, he was argumentative, he was selfish. Let’s just end it already.

---

#I need another!

**bespectacIed** (10): Making the absolute best song of the album as the opener is a baller move, those fucking synths could cut through steel. One of my all-time favorite Chvrches songs. This song's oddly hypnotic to me, and I've always loved how the chorus is cynical and celebratory at the same time. One of my 11s in the rate.

**jexan13** (10): The difference between a good and an average Chvrches song? It's almost always a killer opening riff and amazing drums. Add a great chorus, nice verses and a strong bridge and you got an album standout.

**mudkip1** (10): immediately starting off with an edm SLAPPER

**slimboyfriend** (9): One of my top 5 favorite CHVRCHES songs, and such an intense opener. You can tell Lauren Mayberry and the boys did not come to play

**vayyiqra (8): "Never Ending Circles" is a good description of Lauren's dancing onstage. How the fuck does she do all those pirouettes in those big platform boots? I have always strongly suspected she is really an elf**

**waluigiest** (8): the heavy, slightly glitchy synth is a brilliant start to the album. There are points where I want more depth but overall this is a really solid track.

**modulum83** (7.8): this song sounds like the album cover looks, which makes it a good opener

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Here we go again with the 7.5s.

**Trevsauce88** (7.4): good song, not the greatest opener

**camerinian** (7): Is this the most CHVRCHES-y CHVRCHES song out there? Perhaps. It's good. It's just very… them

**CarlieScion** (7): cute instrumental but i don't really like laurens vocals pensive

**frogaranaman** (7): ah yes that classic CHVRCHES sound

#No man

**saviorARMY101** (7): This song kind of startled me when it begin since it came in so abruptly. This song was very bouncy sounding and kind of fun, though it did get repetitive. Cute song overall.

**1998tweety** (6.5): Her vocals....I'm gonna have to look past them to get through this album.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6.5): I really like the synth riff in it and the bridge is beautiful but it sounds like something is missing? The way the verses goes into the chorus sounds rushed and I feel like there should have been a pre-chorus put between them to make the transition sound not as awkward

**vayyiqra** (4): I rarely play games these days, though they're fun. On the whole they aren't bad but only a few interest me, plus gaming culture is so exhausting and games and consoles are so expensive. When I was younger I would've rated gaming high though.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): I am extremely shocked to see this song so high. I wouldn’t consider it an album highlight or anything, but it is good. One of the most upbeat songs on the album, Keep You On My Side is all about inertia. The production and melody never lets up for a second after the intro. The song itself is also about just staying in a relationship, just delaying the inevitable. Lauren wonders what would happen if she really does call it off. She had to lie about her feelings to keep him around and didn’t want to display her feelings. Also, when those drums come in on the first chorus oo yas.

**Franklytheturtle** (7): there are about 3 different Chvrches. There is 80s bops Chvrches. Exceedingly electronic and sad Chvrches. And monolithic anime opening Chvrches. This song is somewhere between the 80's Chvrches and Anime Chvrches and its pretty good!

---

#I'mWithHer

**rosecult** (10): this slaps!

**vayyiqra** (10): An electro banger with depressing lyrics is exactly my jam. When Lauren said "I don't sleep well / Laying low" ... I felt that :pensive:

**jexan13** (9.5): I love the percussion... And when it gets more intense in the chorus. Truly one of the best chorus of the rate and that bar is incredibly high.

**bandnitos** (9): she's a bop your honor

**camerinian** (9): If I wasn't such a lazy fuck, this would be my permanent gym banger.

**frogaranaman** (9): this song goes unnecessarily hard

**Trevsauce88** (9): reminds me of first year, great track

**waluigiest (9): “hold up both my hands my fingers crossed” that’s how you sign READY in ASL**

**1998tweety** (8): The production on this slaps tbh

**saviorARMY101** (8): The chorus is definitely catchy and very euphoric sounding, which I love. The bassline reminds me of Dancing On My Own which does make me love the song more. Kind of wish the chorus had more drums though.

**modulum83** (7.8): who gave Ms. Chvrches permission to go this hard

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The chopped up vocal samples on this album work really well mostly because there's are good songs underneath them.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (7.5): This sounds like every single edm pop song that was popular in 2012. Not that that’s a bad thing of course

**bespectacIed** (7): bop

#This sounds the same, without restraint

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): These songs are so similar that I'm having a hard time realizing when a song ends and another one starts.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): this is like fine but it also sounds like every chvrches song i've heard

**Franklytheturtle** (11): There is perhaps no sound in the world that will get me to a thousand yard stare quicker than the opening notes of this song. I found this song during the winter two years ago and ever since then it has meant the world to me. Now it is perhaps my most played song ever and almost definitely my favorite song ever. I remember hearing this song for the first time and just being blown away. I had never heard someone be so admittedly shallow, introspective, tender, and truthful all in one song. Especially not a pop song. This song just spoke to me in every way. Emotionally, mentally, aesthetically. Now I've never drunk red wine but I imagine it tastes like this song feels. It's one of those spring days where the sun isn't just going down but it's bleeding out across the sky and the temperature is just riding that line where you aren't sure if it's warm or cold and everything is so beautiful and sublime it's so sad and lonely that it's almost romantic. And you know what if red wine doesn't taste like this I don't want to know or ever ruin this illusion. This song makes me want to fall in love and break my own heart and have every sunset narrated by robotic cat meows. It's gorgeous and visceral and it's honestly everything I've ever wanted to hear and feel in a song.

#I'm sad that this is gone

**letsallpoo** (11): i dont want to die

**notceitn** (11): been v depressed lately so y'all already know this has been on repeat constantly 😎😎😎

**ExtraEater** (10): Frank snapped

**frogaranaman (10): literally if this song ever comes up on my shuffle I sigh and say “guess it’s depression time” and let it happen**

**mudkip1** (10): soothing but kinda boring! why do i feel like im playing stardew valley

**modulum83** (9.7): It's incredible to me how simple this song is, how repetitive the melody is, and yet how utterly hypnotic the groove is. The production is just immaculate.

**saviorARMY101** (9): Only a few seconds in and I already fucking love the production and melody. The verses are amazing though the first post-chorus (?) is a bit unexpected and weird. But as the song continues, everything fits together so well. Great song!

**skargardin** (9): What really does this song for me is its final minute, transcendental stuff.

**InternetDude19** (8.8): Isn't this song about Taylor Swift?

**1998tweety** (8): It's cute I guess

**bandnitos** (8): kinda wish it was more interesting but it's just a good song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): just a taaad boring, but still a great song.

**waluigiest** (8): it’s pretty simple but I like the subtle silliness of it - the salad line is prime

**camerinian** (7.5): That synth tone on the chorus is a bit weird for the vibe, but it is a really good vibe otherwise.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I guess I was mistaken for thinking The 1975 was a rock band

#Imagine being depressed lmao

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6): The music video for this song is a better Joker origin story than the Joker movie that came out this year

**vayyiqra** (6): ~~[REDACTED] It's weird a song with as pretty an instrumental as this has lyrics that boil down to "you're hot but have a shitty personality so I don't like you anymore" and yet most of us have been there I feel.~~ Edit: I gave it an 8 at first but on a second listen it's kind of dull so idk why I did that.

**gwenflip** (5.4): It's unoffensive but honestly sleepy

**Franklytheturtle** (10): I don't know that I understand this song but I also don't think it matters when it bops this fucking hard quite frankly. I think this album is at it's best when it's twinkling by in it's fathers prom suit. This song is really part of what makes this album gorgeous to me. It's fun and shiny while it's still sitting on the fringes of sad and frustrated. It definitely helps that every single member if the band is in peak performance here. "Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely" is easily one of my favorite 1975 bars and "Don't fall in love with the moment and think you're in love with the girl" might be one of my favorite lyrics ever. Also we were very robbed of never getting this video.

#Make America Great Again!

**frogaranaman** (10): don’t worry Matty I always look pathetic

**jexan13** (10): Thank God I'm a latino and can't understand the lyrics about crocked teeth.

**modulum83** (10): This song is pink neon to me. Dazzling, overwhelming, almost unreal.

**saviorARMY101** (9.5): The production and melody on this song is insanely amazing! This is so groovy and catchy, and pure synthpop bliss. The bridge was also beautiful and a nice change of pace. The lyrics are also kind of quirky lol. Defintely one of my favorites!

**camerinian** (9): If her favourite thing she likes to lick is the boots of the veterans, she's American

**rosecult** (9): the “fix my teeth” line gets me because I had to get braces twice in high school because my retainer broke the first time and I was too scared to tell my parents to let me get it fixed and my teeth moved a lot... anyway I love this song

**1998tweety** (8.5): The sax at the end elevated this

**bespectacIed** (8): Yeah it plagiarized Chocolate but issa massive bop still

**vayyiqra** (8): I'm Canadian, and this bops

**thenshecamelikeaaah (7.5): I thought you were a lesbian. (comedy etc. etc.)**

**CarlieScion** (7): i remember when this came out and there were a bunch of pretentious and smug non-american fans who kept saying "if you think this song is flattering @ americans, then ur the stupid people he's singing about" as if nobody but them had any critical thinking skills

**Franklytheturtle** (10): if anime was real this is what it would sound like

**ImADudeDuh** (7): This song always scares me when it starts off. Empty Thread is a song about trying to ignore relationship problem. Much like Keep You On My Side, Empty Threat has Lauren delaying the end of a troubled relationship. She doesn’t know what she was thinking, this relationship is great! She pretends her previous wants just didn’t exist and keeps ignoring it until her problems are spilling over herself like waves. I feel like this song has too much going on in it to be really enjoyable. It’s good, but not great.

---

#No regrets!

**vayyiqra** (11): I love this song. It's pure joy. The video also makes me happy too. This song is happy and makes me happy.

**bespectacIed** (10): Euphoric as fuck. Chvrches really chose the definitive four best songs of the album as singles, THEIR MINDS

**camerinian** (10): This is the perfect synthesis of everything that Chvrches are great at. Prominent, powerful synth melody line, fucking massive percussion, sugar rush levels of energy and Lauren’s brilliant lyricism given a kick in the arse by an emotive and resonant vocal performance. If my literal favourite song ever wasn’t also in this rate, this would easily be my 11.

**InternetDude19** (10): One of my favorite songs of theirs!

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): Holy shit that bridge! This is a great pop song and is definitely going on my personal playlists

**modulum83** (9.4): What a chorus. What a fucking chorus. Just bursting with life.

**saviorARMY101** (9): Holy shit this is a damn bop. I found myself really enjoying how upbeat this song, I kind of forgot to listen to the lyrics. As much as I loved how upbeat it was, I did enjoy how much more slowed down the bridge was.

**jexan13** (8.5): The vocal delivery feels a bit awkward at times. But when you feel the song is lower than average, the bridge comes and saves it.

**gwenflip** (8.4): This one is my guilty pleasure and probably my personal favorite, but I'll admit it objectively gets a little too repetitive to rank it any higher

**1998tweety** (8): The production on this is pretty good...

**bandnitos** (8): the verses >>> the chorus but she's cute

**frogaranaman** (7): okay, bop,

**skargardin** (7): I used to love this song so much but it just feels very mid for some reason

**slimboyfriend (7): Waterpark goths**

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): ;/

#Makes me feel empty inside

**Trevsauce88** (7): decent song, one of the weaker off the album, but still a good song in a vacuum

**waluigiest** (7): I love the bridge but the rest of the song is pretty unassuming

**CarlieScion** (3): this song startled me and not in a good way

**camerinian** (8): Simultaneously a relic of a bygone era that no one pays attention to anymore, and also the saviour of a song's chart position and cultural relevance if the discourse on this fucking sub is anything to go by

**rickikardashian** (8): giving this a high score for the amazing music videos that have been done throughout the last few decades. iconic moments that have marked pop culture in different way. taking off some points just for the existence of the swish swish video

**rosecult** (8): Lady Gaga invented them!

**vayyiqra** (8): I feel a bit guilty because I like music videos and think they can add a lot to a song, especially if they tell a story and/or have really good visuals. I don't watch them as much as I should though.

**Franklytheturtle** (10): Good God does Jack Antonoff know how to inspire an emotion. There's just so many things to feel in this it's hard to parse it all but what a way to start an album. Magnificent

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): An album opener that really sets up the scene well. This song being used in Love, Simon makes so much sense. It's big, anthemic, and was inspired by damn John Hughes movies for pete's sake. It's full of melodrama and actual drama, and taps perfectly into teenage love. Love this song.

---

#Taylor Swift - Everything Has Changed and now it's only you that matters

**J\_Toe** (11): This song is so sad yet so euphoric at the same time, in both its sound and lyrics. I will never not associate this song with Love Simon now. I don't even remember when it played in the movie (the credits) but it was on the soundtrack, and it definitely feels like a Simon song, and that's probably part of the reason why I feel like I need to shed a (cathartic) tear every time I hear the song.

**1998tweety** (10): An iconic gay BOP. I only really started stanning this song after hearing it in Love Simon, but WOW I've forever associated this song with that movie so it always takes me back to that feeling of watching it alone in a movie theatre and bawling my eyes out.

**CarlieScion** (10): jackoff can capture my wild heart

**frogaranaman** (10): damn, my gay ass really knows how to sob, huh,

**jexan13** (9.5): This is so intense. That chorus is so good. But it feels... drowned, somehow?

**rickikardashian (9.5): one day, I'll be able to get one of those expensive ass headphones that make the quality of the music almost perfect and will be able to enjoy this to its full capacity, till now, I guess my 30$ headphones will do**

**bespectacIed** (9): Great opener, brilliant production as expected

**camerinian** (9): Jesus talk about starting off as huge as humanly possible. Also this is in many ways the basis for everything Bleachers has ever made and it's an impeccable foundational song

**ExtraEater** (9): Screams Jack Antonoff more than any other song in this album

**InternetDude19** (9): Jack knows how to start albums

**saviorARMY101** (9): H O L Y S H I T what an opening. This is pure 80s synthpop bliss and this is so unexpectedly good. A great start to album.

**vayyiqra** (8): I like the arpeggiating synth but why are the vocals so quiet? Either way a good opener. We're off to a good start with this new wave sound.

**waluigiest** (8): The plinking keyboard is a fun way to start the album. This is flowery and bloated but overall pretty nice :)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Not a bad start.

**modulum83** (7.3): Some nice ideas here but the songwriting seems rather unfocused and messy - which is a Jack Antonoff staple, tbh.

#Heart Palpatations

**bandnitos** (7): im fucking bored like its good but this sounds like a saltine with a lot of reverb

**slimboyfriend** (7): This song sounds like every 80s teen romance movie at once. It's cheesy and triumphant and nonspecific and I like it.

**Trevsauce88** (7): solid opening track, love the piano

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6.5): The verses and the chorus make it sound like the song’s building up to something big but then it….never happens? There’s the breakdown near the end of the song that sounds really cool and I would’ve loved for that part to be stretched out but its far too short for me

**gwenflip** (5.6): It's good as an opener to this album as a whole, but doesn't stand as well on its own

**hikkaru** (5.5): opening with this when Rollercoaster is right there... smh wyd

**mudkip1** (2): i was really excited to hear this album again until i remembered how much i dislike the way he layers his voice to create faux harmony. it sounds like he's trying to make his songs sound triumphant and exuberant but sweetie you can't have that kind of energy while lookin like the human equivalent of a marshmallow. go back to writing for pop girlies [Aka "I gave this song a bad score, cause Jack is ugly"]

**Franklytheturtle** (10): So really I thought this song was about a relationship for a very very long time. It was one of the first 1975 songs I fell in love with. My favorite line was always (and still is) "stop pacing round the room using other people's faces as a mirror for you". So I'd always get to this second line of the song and just stop listening to that fat fucking groove and the drug thing was very lost on me for awhile. But I think that's the beauty of The 1975 and this song. It's just guys being dudes. What could be better?

---

#Ugh, his mind

**bandnitos** (10): i had a phase where this was my absolute favorite song in middle school

**camerinian** (10): I think is the song that finally won me over on The 1975. That guitar lick is so fucking tight, as is Matty's vocal performance, and the lyrics are only a liiiiiitle bit smug as opposed to the total wankery that they normally hit

**frogaranaman** (10): I dooon’t have the capacityforfuckenyou’remeanttobe H E L P I N G me.

**jexan13** (10): The second victim of a "ugh" title in ILIWYSFYASBYSUOI. The first was the album, of course. However, this is pop perfection. The synths and drums are sexy and the chorus is lovely.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD (10): "what is your favorite the 1975 song" "oh it's all caps UGH exclamation point"**

**bespectacIed** (9.5): So fucking catchy and one of their fan favorites for a good reason. Matty's raspy voice in this track is so sexy

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I don't have much to say about these songs other than that they're great to listen to and that this album is definitely the superior one. Will not be taking any further questions. Thanks.

**notceitn** (9): this song has grown on me so much I used to hate it but it's just been hitting different lately yknow

**waluigiest** (9): why choose between sex and drugs when you can have both?

**modulum83** (8.7): it is impossible not to move your body to this song

**1998tweety** (8): Same energy as Oh No! by Marina

**saviorARMY101** (8): I love the production on this track especially the synths and drums. Initially this song wasn't interesting but it progressivally got better. The lyrics are interesting.

**Trevsauce88** (7.5): overall great song

**vayyiqra** (7): what Prince song is this

#Ugh, this shit sucks

**skargardin** (6): Incredibly forgettagle but it's pleasant enough to listen to so I can't be too hard on it. I feel like this is going to be my thoughts on most of the album.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6): The title of this song summarizes my feelings towards this band

**Franklytheturtle** (10): it takes a very special kind of depression for me to get into this song. But when I get there this shit HITS. I don't know that I love this as much as most people for that reason but it's a great track nonetheless

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Leave A Trace is an angry song. Lauren has had it. He can’t manipulate her anymore. He can’t act like he’s the innocent one in the relationship and like this caught him off guard, but she knows that’s a lie. The chorus specifically longs for the relief of a break up, while warning him to be sure to not lie like he normally does. She also makes sure to tell him that when he lies his ass off, make sure to bury the truth as much as he can, but try to retain *some* humanity in himself. It’s angry, it’s shimmering, and it’s probably my favorite CHVRCHES song.

#Drake - Take Care

**agentofscranton** (10): i went into this rate thinking this would be a surefire 10, but when i got to it I didn't love it as much as I remember loving it? it's still a 10, but like, a very soft 10

**bespectacIed** (10): Chvrches opened a new era with an excellent song, with some of their best lyrics imo (the way lauren sang the line I will wipe the salt off of my skin/ And I'll admit that I got it wrong always gives me chills). It was the logical lead single to me, since it has a more dark electronic vibe to it, in contrast with the bright synths of their previous album. Mandatory "one of my 11s in this rate" comment

**camerinian** (10): This was the song that turned me into a Chvrches fan. I wasn't as wowed by Bones as seemingly everybody else was, but I heard this song on a whim and was immediately floored by the emotive power of it. Lauren's voice is absolutely stunning and the lyrical sentiments are gut-wrenching

**frogaranaman** (10): my first CHVRCHES track, ahhh :’)

**saviorARMY101** (9): This song is definitely a bop and one of the few songs I already knew by them. The synths from beginning to end are very captivating and are greatly produced. The song as a whole is really great but the chorus and bridge for sure are the best parts.

**modulum83** (8.9): This kinda gives me Bond theme vibes - it's so sleek and confident and stylish.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This bops a fair bit

**bandnitos (8): i have a soft spot for this song bc it got me into chvrches after i heard it in a hollister**

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (8): ok but why does the music video look like it takes place in the oil of every pearl’s uninsides cover

**Trevsauce88** (8): great first single, overall solid track

**vayyiqra** (8): It isn't one of my favourites on the album but I can't imagine it without it. Also, the video is cool

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This song is a tiny bit overrated, but I will admit that the chorus is RUTHLESS.

#Take better care of what you put on your album

**jexan13** (7): The weakest song in here. Not bad, of course, but it doesn't shine too much.

**waluigiest** (7): this is kind of here and there, it’s got some solid material but some of the choices on the track are questionable

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): i liked this and then i realized every song lauren sings on also sounds like it and then i was like well alright i guess i like it less

**ImADudeDuh** (11): At first, I had questions about what I could make my 11, but really, this was a much easier decision than I realized. I Wanna Get Better is an incredible song. The debut single for Bleachers, and honestly, I don’t think they will ever be able to top it. I Wanna Get Better is such a cathartic song. It’s a song that came from Jack Antonoff suffering the unfortunate loss of his sister at 13 years old while he was 18, leading to an emotional explosion years in the making. He knew that he would have to get the lyrics to this song perfect for him to be satisfied. A mix of sadness, anger, and confusion, the song knows when to showcase each emotion at the peak of it’s pathos for 3 minutes and 24 seconds. The song knows how to build and build upon itself from it’s fast paced opening, Jack’s speedy singing, to the anthemic chorus of realization that you need to better yourself. There’s the verse after the second chorus where Jack gets faster and faster until the emotion explodes into a kick-ass guitar solo. Right after the guitar solo finishes, the reverb from the last note just plays on for a bit just to let the adrenaline run out and cool down, before Jack delivers the quietest, most emotional point of the song. He has a dream of his deceased sister telling him to move on and start bettering himself instead of dwelling on her. So, he makes the decision to finally change himself and start getting better instead of just wanting to get better. The day before I write this, I had 2 different emotional breakdowns in front of both of my parents individually due to my thoughts of being a failure. Relistening to this song truly helped me after that terrible night. I truly believe this can be considered the best song of the 2010’s as this song that’s definitely helped me and countless others that not only need assurance that things will get better, but making us admit that we want things to get better.

**Franklytheturtle** (10): I have felt this song down in the most inaccessible parts of my soul. I should type some kind of essay about just how deeply this song has touched me and how deeply I've felt it back and how many times I've cried listening to it but there's just nothing that can be said. This song is an honest to goodness masterpiece and I honestly truly mean that.

---

#I didn't know I hadn't heard the best song ever, till I heard this song

**agentofscranton** (11): the last minute of the song - the guitar solo to that bridge to the final chorus - is one of my favourite minutes in music, so fucking good. please marry me jack antonoff.

**camerinian** (11): This is my favourite song of all time. No hyperbole. No typical pophead exaggeration. This will probably be my #1 until the day I die. Everything about this song is perfect. The punchy chords give an immediate sense of urgency that doesn’t let up at any point, but the way it seemingly still only swells to even greater heights is awe-inspiring, right up until the last shouted line of every verse going into the chorus, belted as if it’s the last line Jack will ever sing. The chorus is an anthemic belter that must have been lab-tested for maximum ‘shout to yourself in your bedroom’ appeal, the shredding guitar solo comes at the climax of everything threatening to collapse in on itself, and the lyrics. My God. How Jack packs so much evocative, precise, stunning detail into every single line, creating the image of the panicked man on the edge of everything irreparably going to shit, only for it all to yank itself back into a state of recovery with that brilliant chorus. A glimmer of hope after line after line of self-loathing, heartbreak and regret. After so many verses and tense moments of internalised panic and worry, everything is calmed a little bit by one beautiful life-affirming sentiment. It's that dichotomy that I think best encapsulates what I love so much about this song. Sometimes, a simple message at the right time can hit like a cannonball to the chest. I love this, eternally. 11 is really too low for an instant classic of pop like this (but I hope maybe this dissertation got close lol)

**CarlieScion** (11): possibly the boppiest song in existence

**InternetDude19** (11): Relatable

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Just an incredibly cathartic song. The guitar solo really lets it all lose. This and Clearest Blue serve similar function for me, but this one I have a slightly more personal attachment to.

**waluigiest** (11): I remember when this song came out on Soundcloud. I was a HUGE fun. fan so I listened to it tons on the day it came out, putting it on loop in my car and screaming along to it. It had such an immediate visceral impact on me. It was so relatable to a lonely, awkward high schooler trying to get by. This is synthpop excellence.

**1998tweety** (10): oh WOW this is a total mood.

**bespectacIed** (10): Almost an 11, and probably my personal favorite song in the rate. Makes me as emotional in my 100381st listen as it does on my first time. It's a cliché reaction to this song, but it helped me a lot through life

**frogaranaman** (10): I listen to this every day I want to die, so naturally, at November 11, I have 315 plays on it this year alone,

**gwenflip** (10): This almost got my 11. Was it overplayed at the time it came out? Yes. Does it still hold up 5 years later? Absolutely.

**jexan13** (10): One of the standouts of the album. Amazing pop. Also, don't @ me but this is where the album starts to get worse, so, he didn't want hard enough.

**saviorARMY101** (9): Sad lyrics with upbeat melody/tempo always works for me, though in this case, the sense of hopefulness gives the song a more of an emotional impact and relateable- ness for me.

**slimboyfriend (9): It's still teen angst if you're feeling it at age 30**

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Yessss this is the one. Banger!

**Trevsauce88** (9): great song, endlessly catchy

**bandnitos** (8): a cute bop but the bridge, as fun as it is, is a little offputting

#I wish this song would get better

**modulum83** (8): overrated, but nevertheless very fun

**hikkaru** (7): listen... it's okay but it doesn't invite Sarah Tonin directly into my house like everyone else says it does

**vayyiqra** (7): I hate the filter on these vocals but I like the message behind the lyrics because tbh same

**rosecult** (5): you won’t

**gannade** (4.5): the first 2 minutes was pretty good then someone screamed?? and then a bunch of noise came on

**notceitn** (4): the tinashe version is far superior

**SinfulAnarchy** (4): I know this is a fan favorite, but I can’t get into it. it’s just a wall of noise. not catchy or memorable at all imo, I don’t understand the hype.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4): this song sounds like natural by imagine dragons

**Franklytheturtle** (10): This is the quintessential Chvrches song I'm sorry to everything else but this shit hits DIFFERENT

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): RIP CHVRCHES. You’d think with all the support this got in the thread, it would be at least top 3. This was winning early on in the rate, but eventually, it just kept falling and falling. It got stuck at number 5 by the end of October, and it stayed there like a rock the rest of the day. A song that we called the [20th best song of 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/clx4xh/the_top_100_tracks_of_2015_according_to_rpopheads/evzdjo7/), Clearest Blue is a great lead single. CHVRCHES came back with their synths brighter and their music poppier. Still keeping the wit of their debut album, Clearest Blue is definitely a moment. While it takes a bit to get it fully started, by the time the 2nd chorus drops, you are transported into an 80’s synthpop explosion. It’s glorious, and definitely deserved it’s high placement inthe rate.

#Black Eyed Peas - Meet Me Halfway

**dustinhenderson0** (11): Seeing this live is surreal, blew me away

**gwenflip** (11): How can you not just feel GOOD when you listen to this?!

**mudkip1 (11): uh huh yes, she's a server she serves**

**slimboyfriend** (11): Now THIS is how you build a song

**Trevsauce88** (11): phenomenal track, I was in the audience the first time they every played Clearest Blue in public, and it was one of my favourite concert experiences

**bespectacIed** (10): Damn it, I wish there was a universe that Carly stole this song, that was a Emotion chorus and instrumental if I've ever heard of one. The shift to the instrumentals is orgasmic, it always make me emotional from the pure happiness it exudes. The single choices of this era were just fucking topnotch. Mandatory "one of my 11s in this rate" comment

**hikkaru** (10): the drop makes me nut

**InternetDude19** (10): What a satisfying climax.

**rosecult** (10): this is such a bop ugh

**saviorARMY101** (10): This song is fucking amazing. I adore how the synths, the overall production, and the lyrics just keep building onto each other and the song keeps getting better until it explodes into a bouncy electro house drop. Just fantastic overall.

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): nice synths, but this song feels like it’s going to go somewhere but doesn’t.

**vayyiqra** (10): This seems to be a frontrunner for the rate winner. It's definitely a bop and it's fun, and I love the title (blue is my favourite colour!). However they have other tracks on the album that are just are good in my onion.

**waluigiest** (10): the synths here are luscious. The way this track swells is truly gorgeous and the dance break bridge is so wet. This song fucks.

**jexan13** (9.5): It doesn't start too interesting. But the instrumental getting more intense, culminating in that beautiful synth beat at the end, elevates this a lot.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I am going to be surprised if this doesn't win.

**1998tweety** (9): Oh wow this is actually pretty good

**modulum83** (8): not really much until the big synth drop hits, at which point I go WILD

**frogaranaman** (7): me talking about the sky

#Clearest loser

**camerinian** (6.5): This is a fun song yeah. Not really sure why this was the big favourite from the album though. It's pretty underwritten compared to the rest of the album, and doesn't really have the soaring hooks. That drop seriously does hit though

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): The build up to the drop was so good but then when it actually happens it's so disappointing

**bandnitos** (4): i really don't like the production (not related but the gryffin remix is so much better)

**Overall Average**: 7.271 **// Average Controversy:** 1.786

---

**jexan13** (8.900): This is what I was waiting for. Liked the other two Chvrches album, but I absolutely loved this one. Those damn riffs bring the songs alive and everything is so catchy and beautiful. No filler, just the right running time. Even with the incredible competition in this rate, this is the superior album.

**vayyiqra** (8.600): Chvrches are one of my favourite bands, and I find it baffling that some fans hated this album when it came out and thought it was a big step down from their debut. While their debut is my favourite album of theirs, I think this one is almost as good and both are very solid. (Even Love Is Dead is fairly good; fite me.) I listened to both of them almost on repeat when I got into the band in 2017 and this album reminds me of that time, streaming it in the summer and fall nonstop. It has some of their best songs on it and a lot of replay value. Overall score: 8.6

**bespectacIed** (8.100): My personal favorite album of the rate, this is excellent synth pop albeit with a few fillers (i.e. the deluxe songs, don't @ me). I still think Every Open Eye is every bit as good as Bones, EOE's production is so much more fun and pristine (annyeong!), but looking back this one definitely aged a tiny tiny bit more than their opus of a debut. It's still full of excellent songs and memories, buoyed by chvrches' sublime synths that we been knew they always deliver, and lauren mayberry's irresistibly charming voice. Quality album right here.

**InternetDude19** (7.787): Chvrches are the first band I really got into, and this was the first time I got to really experience an album cycle, so this is a pretty important album to me. The first three thirds of this album are fantastic. Last third and the bonus songs are mostly meh.

**megm26** (7.347): before this my only exposure to them was their song with marshmello which I hate so this was a pleasant surprise, but some of the songs start to blend together after a while and it gets pretty repetitive. Each song is good separately, but all together it's too similar.

**modulum83** (7.253): Synth pop rock of the cold futuristic variety. To be honest, CHVRCHES writes the same song multiple times over on this album, but it's a very very good song. Their soundscapes and wielding of the synthesizer as an instrument is the real highlight here. Ideal environment for this album: the soundtrack that plays as you pace through your gilded and florally-decorated empty palace, pondering the destruction of your enemies.

**waluigiest** (7.200): I’d never listened to them. This album is consistently good enough but really only has a few moments that felt special.

**slimboyfriend** (6.900): I was OBSESSED with this album when it first came out because it introduced me to CHVRCHES, but now listening to it after a few years I realize.... it's just pretty good.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6.567): Compared to all the other female-led alt acts that are popular, Chvrches (or as i call them, cha-vur-ches) never stood out to me as being particularly interesting. Their songs aren’t as catchy as Paramore or Marina and the Diamonds, They don’t have a unique sound like Lana Del Rey or Lorde, and Lauren’s voice, at least on the songs I’ve heard on the radio of them, isn’t immediately breath taking like Amy Lee or Florence Welch’s. And contrary to many people’s opinion, I never liked The Mother We Share that much. So I wasn’t expecting much going into this album, expecting an average pop/rock album. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with how many songs on this album I ended up liking! The songs on this album definitely showcase the band’s talent much better than their big singles do, and I was proven wrong on my belief that Lauren isn’t a particularly good singer, the songs on here really show her range. My main problem with the album is that some songs go on longer than they should, and like I said in my comment of Bow Down, their choruses aren't always the best.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.567): I like CHVRCHES in theory more than in execution. Their blend of synthpop with some EDM elements works really well, but their songs tend to blend together too much. I actually liked Love Is Dead simply because they took more risks and more songs stood out as a result. Anyways, the singles here are good but I've already forgotten everything else. [Grade: B-]

**gwenflip** (6.127): This album has some really high highs, but the rest is meh and blends together.

**notceitn** (5.467): it's better than strange desire but still not really my thing

**gannade** (3.400): I do not like this album very much. I think the female lead singer has a really thin voice and its also pitched kinda high, which I do not enjoy. Out of all three albums, this album was also the noisiest one and has too much going on. I think it is overproduced. Overall, I think this album is closer to "noise" than anything enjoyable to my ears.

**Franklytheturtle** (10): this is the best song ever made and that is not up for debate. This song sounds like falling in love and the last day of school and the first day of summer and just idk man there just aren't a lot of things more perfect in the world than this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yup. The 1975 won. This was (surprisingly?) the last line of defense against them. A song that barely received any 11’s, yet most people could agree was completely awesome. Rollercoaster has great valleys and peaks in the song that helps edge it out over I Wanna Get Better for most. Easily the happiest song on Strange Desire, Rollercoaster is just a straight up love song with a melody that’s reminiscent of Jack’s happiest production for other artists (most notably, Getaway Car and Cruel Summer). The lyrics are all so great, they would all be fit for a summer couple instagram caption. It’s scientifically proven that you can’t listen to this song without smiling. Now…… what won the rate?

---

#A wild ride

**1998tweety** (11): Pretty much the same thing as Wild Heart, I started stanning this after Love Simon, but Rollercoaster has an extra thing to it that makes me like it even more. I think Wild Heart sounds a little messy at points, whereas Rollercoaster has an amazing infectious chorus. A deserving rate winner.

**saviorARMY101** (11): This fucking slaps so hard, the song is perfectly titled since this song puts me on a rollercoaster of emotions and an adventure. Definitely my favorite song on the album and probably my favorite song on this rate. Its such a perfect song.

**bandnitos** (10): this shit !!! thank u jack antonoff turn that shit up

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my 11s in the rate. It's just so euphoric. This is my "tunnel song"

**camerinian** (10): RO-OLLERCOASTER I DON’T SAY NO might be one of the best fucking hooks of the decade and the fact that it’s so simple kinda makes me angry how is Jack such a genius

**CarlieScion** (10): some! killer! queen! you! are!

**gwenflip** (10): Literally pure fun in a song

**hikkaru** (10): euphoric blast of nostalgic energy, what Jack does best

**InternetDude19** (10): So much fun

**modulum83** (10): Came very very close to getting my 11. This song feels like adventure, like waking up and seizing the day. Listening to it always puts me in a good mood, and that's no small feat.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): Now THAT’S what I call a bop!

**waluigiest** (9): It’s wild to revisit this album in 2019. I heard this and was like “oh this sounds just like Taylor Swift” and realized Jack Antonoff owns a very important corner of the music industry and crafted songs like Getaway Car in his likeness

**jexan13** (8.5): Issa bop with a nice vocal delivery.

**megm26** (8.5): this is very explosive and I love it

**frogaranaman (8): my first rollercoaster was that Mall Of America one where you’re spinning the entire time**

**slimboyfriend** (8): This song makes me remember the wild teen romance I never had

**vayyiqra** (8): I can imagine hearing this on the radio in the 80s. It's lots of fun. :kimbryell:

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Uh oh another 7.5 I hope I don't give everything a 7.5 lol.

ImADudeDuh: # Strange Desire

---

**Overall Average**: 7.185 **// Average Controversy:** 2.046

---

**TragicKingdom1** (9.273): one of my favorite albums of ALL TIME!! 100% anthems of every variety, excellent songwriting, polished production, this has it all. [Grade: A+]

**CarlieScion** (9.091): an album full of 10s

**agentofscranton** (8.909): this entire album was designed to be the soundtrack to a indie coming-of-age road trip drama change my mind

**waluigiest** (8.182): Bleachers was a huge thing for me because fun. was my first favorite band. I loved their music and before Jack Antonoff was a main pop girl I knew him from that.

**jexan13** (7.955): So I finally get to hear who's rui... oops, I mean, producing my faves albums. This rate's line-up definitively doesn't help this album. Compare Chvrches blooming synths and The 1975 colorful riffs to Antonoff's drowned instrumentals and you get a clear loser. Seriously, Antonoff's production feels like wrapping a broadsword with a wide sheet. Such a shame, since you can feel that the melodies and lyrics are quite good. This doesn't mean this is a bad album, tho, but everything blends in the worst of ways and it's hardly memorable.

**InternetDude19** (7.918): Like his second album Gone Now, the front half is stacked.

**modulum83** (7.491): Synth pop rock of the retro nostalgia variety. This album is very inconsistent, but when Jack gets it right, he really gets it right. He has a real talent for writing incredibly catchy hooks and that talent comes out in spades on this album. He channels the spirit of 80s coming-of-age movies so well; I only wish he'd stick to that more often instead of going on weird Grimes-related tangents. Ideal environment for this album: blasting in the car as you drive out on a road trip with all your friends, without a care in the world.

**slimboyfriend** (7.091): Stop pretending to hate Jack Antonoff and just listen to this album. It’s not that bad.

**vayyiqra** (7.091): I admit I've never had any real interest in Bleachers despite always being a fan of Jackoff and a defender of his. I feel like Popheads hates on him nowadays just because his style (80s-inspired synthpop with a lot of reverb) was everywhere during the middle of the last decade, until trap beats took over towards the end of it. But I never get tired of this sound myself and just because something is used a lot doesn't mean it's overused. I also like Jack as a person and think he seems like a wholesome and well-meaning guy. Dating Lena Dunham was an L for him, maybe, but who cares? That has nothing to do with his music. I just find it odd and rather ironic that Popheads creamed themselves to Melodrama when it came out and now hates on the man who produced it. Anyway, enough about Jack and about the album: it was a solid nostalgia trip to the new wave music I grew up listening to, even though I was a 90s kid. It's not amazing but I can see it growing on me. The weak point is, as expected, the vocals but I don't think they're bad so much as just not to my taste. Popheads would do well to learn the difference between those two things. I know this album is going to be done dirty, but I hope my scores help a bit with that. Overall rating: 7.1

**skargardin** (6.818): It had its moments but usually Jack's vocals faltered over the production. I'm intrigued to listen to Terrible Thrills after this.

**mudkip1** (6.000): this was a lot worse than i remembered

**bespectacIed** (5.364): I might seem like a hater for my scores here, but two of the songs here I love dearly and are two of my most listened songs of all time. But yeah this album's a rough listen. It's neither innovative nor enjoyably generic. Jack Antonoff is a capable producer and has helped curate our favorite pop albums this decade, but his mediocre songwriting and irritating voice aren't doing him any favors on his OWN albums.

**letsallpoo** (5.364): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwK_9zDWkAA2qwy.jpg

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5.191): Trying to making it though this album was an absolute snooze fest. The singles on this album are pretty much the only things worth listening to, probably because they’re the only times where anything remotely interesting happens in them. There’s also many moments where the tracks seem like it’s building up to something big and loud, but it either never comes or is so short that it’s not even worth all the buildup towards it. Jack Antonoff is clearly talented based on his production and the few good songs on this album but he wastes his talents on here by making boring, uninspired songs that sound like Ed Sheeren rejects.

**notceitn** (4.545): I hate his voice and I'm not a fan of the production either tbfh

**Franklytheturtle** (10): Is this the best song ever made? Probably not. But am I going to say that it is literally anytime i hear any part of it? Yes I am. On every level this song is just utterly unbelievable. The way it's a fun groove until the second the sun's starts to set and it's known every heartbreak you've ever had. This song shows what's so good about The 1975. It's showing how passion links emotions. Happy and sad angry and in love. And in this case it's soul crushing sadness and a fat fucking groove. This song is special in a way I'm sure I can't describe and in a way I don't have enough character space left to for

---

#God i wish that were me

**bandnitos** (11): i am depressed bisexual teenager this was the only option in the end. i have listened to this song while crying in bed countless times. it pat my back, acted as a therapist, and also cuffed my jeans for me. thank you, somebody else.

**bespectacIed** (11): I don't see any other song winning the rate. It's moody without being cloying, it's synthy but not in a typical popheads upbeat bop, and it fucking influenced the tone Melodrama according to Lorde ha-self!!! What a gorgeously produced and written song, emotionally mature and poignant but still retains Matty's childish and vulgar point of view. I love this song so much, it's just one of those songs that after the first listen, you just know it'll be a classic in an artist's discography. P.S. Lorde's cover of this song was atrocious, I just wanna put it out there

**frogaranaman** (11): deep breath AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA mood

**jexan13** (11): This is so hauntingly beautiful and sad. The instrumental, god. Those haunting synths in the chorus, the drums pattern, the drowned vocals in the afterchorus. It's just pop perfection. For the n-th time in a review of this rate: This Is Pop Perfection. It was really hard choosing an 11 out of many amazing songs... but this is the horse I'm betting for.

**rickikardashian** (11): Honestly, I always saw the praise for this song, and I just didn't get, it never really clicked with me and it just felt like whatever, until one of these hears, it just hit me. I fell in love with this song straight away, and all of the feelings in the song were overflowing my ears and taking me on a whole ride. I don't know what happened, but from that moment I knew this was going to be my 11 and it had no competition

**rotating3Dtext** (11): whenever I listen to this song I remember that Lorde likes it. But also that it’s, like, really good.

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): honestly, this song isn't even a 10 imo, but it's my favorite song in this rate, so i'll give it my 11, lol.

**skargardin** (11): This song's got such an incredible progression and just continues to build and build to absolute synthpop euphoria, i love it so much

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): This is one of my Top 50 songs of the entire decade. An absolute journey of a song, with several beautiful climaxes. A song that stays with you for a long time every time you hear it. Infinite replay value.

**1998tweety** (10): A competitor for my 11, wow this is such a good song.

**agentofscranton** (10): would've been my 11 in a bleachers-less rate. dancing on my own's more depressing little sibling

**gwenflip** (10): The saddest bop for the saddest bois

**InternetDude19** (10): Perfection!

**jimmy345960** (10): THIS SONG. HOLY SHIT, HOW DID THEY MAKE IT. ALMOST AN 11. PLS I LOVE THANKS

**modulum83 (10): Hard to find a song that fits well both at a dance club and crying alone in the back of the taxi but here it is.**

**rosecult** (10): the “get someone you love, get someone you need, fuck that get money” part slaps!

**saviorARMY101** (10): Definitely adore the dreampop/synthpop sound this song has which makes it very nostalgic sounding. This is a fucking classic.

**gannade** (9): a rate winner

**CarlieScion** (8): a bit repetitive

**hikkaru** (8): chill bop but it does not have to be 6 minutes long

**vayyiqra** (8): I am vibing to this

**waluigiest** (8): sad boy crying at the club

#whiny

**camerinian** (7): The Verite version's better don't @ me

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Gonna be honest, Vérité's version of this is way way better

**Franklytheturtle** (10): This is the song that at least I was imagining my senior prom would be like. It was not. But I vicariously live through this song anyway. Honestly what can I even say about this? It's a true masterpiece. It's fun, it's euphoric, it's witty, it's effeminate, and it's just a fucking bop man. This is the 1975 at ,not just their absolute best, the best of modern pop music.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The winner! And let me tell you, this was not close. It was ahead since October 14 and it just kept extending and extending it’s lead. Somebody Else did give it a run for it’s money the last week, but it never came with 15 points of winning either way. But all the formalities and congratulations out of the way, the song itself fucking slaps! From the bouncy 80’s synths that open up the track, to the chorus’s vocals, to the damn guitar solo! It’s all so fun and damn bitchy! Matty is over this girl! She called him a hypocrite, made fun of his sexuality, and said his shoes and songs were kinda crap! But guess what, she’s still calling back for him and wanting to hook up again? PUH-lease! Maybe it’s true, he’s a narcissist, his style’s weird, and he’s never said he’s a full on 0 on the Kinsey scale… idk maybe it can work out? Either way, this song is probably the best combination of “Moody,” “Synth,” “Pop,” “Rock,” in the whole rate, so it’s only fitting that this is the big winner. Congrats on The 1975 for winning their first rate!

#I love the sound of this!

**hikkaru** (11): the punches of piano and synth are so infectious and the guitar solo is to die for !!! POP 👏 PERFECTION 👏

**modulum83** (11): The Sound is the towering apex of ILIWYS and the climax of the album's journey. It's a celebration of emotion and freedom, an unabashedly maximalist pop song that seems to emerge from the dreamy murkiness of the rest of the album to give you a single moment to just get on the dancefloor and forget about the rest of the world. It marks a euphoric high - so much that the rest of the album afterwards is basically just coming down.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (11): One of my favorite songs of all time. Ever single second of this song is absolutely EUPHORIC and that guitar solo? Holy FUCK that sends me. This was the first 1975 song I’ve ever heard and this set the bar so high for them that nothing they ever make will ever top it in my eyes

**1998tweety** (10): Oh wow a mega bop much better than Carly's

**bespectacIed** (10): How many basic bitches have y'all seen use "sycophantic, prophetic, socratic junkie wannabe" as their twitter/IG bio? Ignoring the vulgar verses, anthemic is the only word to describe this song, really. It's tailor-made to be the closer in arena tour, the thousands of people screaming that lovely hook to the band and vice versa

**camerinian** (10): Jesus this is so tight. What a hook, what a groove, what a solo, and lyrics that are actually vivid and exciting instead of deep inside their own ass. This is peak 1975, operating on all cylinders, and if all their tracks were more in this vein, they'd probably be a favourite band of mine

**frogaranaman** (10): fun fact, this is my karaoke song :)

**InternetDude19** (10): A total bop

**jexan13** (10): The instrumental of this is soooo good. Makes you feel hype from the first second. And it fills it. This is perhaps the best chorus of the rate. Just amazing.

**slimboyfriend** (10): House-disco KINGS, come through with those SAT words!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): im doing my part

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): The 80s found dead.

**Trevsauce88** (10): I love this song

**bandnitos** (9): i am having a blast

**CarlieScion** (9): inserts halseys cover of this here ->

**saviorARMY101** (9): This was one of the few tracks that I already knew and loved by The 1975. This 80s influenced synthpop/ new wave track is just so catchy and infectious, it commands you to dance. A bop for sure.

**waluigiest** (9): sounds more like the first few tracks of the album, which I really loved. Blends clever writing with funky synthpop beats. Well executed.

**megm26** (8.8): I've actually heard this song before on a FIFA soundtrack from back when my brother used to play it all the time, it's still a bop.

**vayyiqra** (8): Did they really just work the phrase "Epicurean philosophy" into a nu-disco bop

**rosecult** (7): too repetitive at times but this is nice

**Overall Average**: 7.154 **// Average Controversy:** 2.022

**frogaranaman** (9.294): legit didn’t even need to listen to this album to rank everything

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.824): https://twitter.com/ULTRAGLOSS/status/1190663354186190849

**modulum83** (8.659): Synth pop rock of the dreamy emotional variety. This is without a doubt one of my favorite albums of all time. The 1975 goes for so many styles that simply should not work together, and for a 1 hour+ album manages to stitch together a complete emotional journey with immaculate production that brings you to another world. Ideal environment for this album: walking through the city at 3 am after being dumped, wandering mindlessly through the streets, where everything seems hyperreal and fluorescent.

**notceitn** (8.618): I love this album so much!! their whole discography is perfect for autumn :)

**jexan13** (8.471): This was an incredible surprise. I liked A Brief Inquiry, but it felt too chaotic as an album. This one is much better in that aspect. The melodies and instruments are just a delight. However... 72 minutes... That's way too damn much. The good thing is that it keeps the momentum farily well.

**InternetDude19** (8.259): It is a tad too long, but otherwise fantastic pop record. Just cut one or two of the instrumentals.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.235): Very atmospheric with some extremely good highlights. I could do without so many ballads, but I can't say there's really a weak point on here. [Grade: A-]

**agentofscranton** (7.765): literally the worst album title of all time, it's not even obnoxiously long enough to circle round to being hilarious like fiona apple's when the pawn yadayada

**waluigiest** (7.000): Okay I thought this was going to be the best album ever after the first few tracks. Then the middle sucked for so long. It lost the quippy charm of the intro to the album and retreated into bland sad boy-isms and suddenly the uncharacteristic detail/passion in their Genius entries made sense.

**hikkaru** (6.971): I'm a little bit conflicted with this album because while I think a LOT of the production choices are absolutely beautiful, the instrumental portions can get tiring. I wish they cut them down to just the best tracks so that the great stuff could shine more and not get brought down from the less interesting songs that just pad the album out because according to The 1975 long = artsy and good.

**bespectacIed** (6.941): This was the album that turned me around for The 1975. Before this, to me they were an arrogant group of british pricks who make catchy music, but will always be D-list rock star wannabes. After this album, they suddenly became these adorable, feminist (read their teen vogue interview) dudes who are capable of making emotionally mature pop rock. This is in no way a perfect album, it's a four of five filler songs too long and the songwriting is hit or miss. But with the cleaner, more sophisticated production, I really enjoyed it for the most part, and it has my 11.

**vayyiqra** (6.706): This is my first time hearing this album after hearing of the acclaim it got, and I've been wanting to listen to it for a while now. I ended up liking it and found it good throughout, though its running time is a bit daunting. Unlike most rates I listened to the other two albums in the rate twice to make sure my scores were accurate since I've never heard them but have heard Every Open Eye lots of times. I would say it's my second-favourite in the rate. Overall score:

**slimboyfriend** (6.206): Make no mistake, after listening to this album I still hate The 1975, but now I just recognize they make good music.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4.618): ok look I’m not gonna sugarcoat this, I think the 1975 are a fucking terrible band with one of the most pretentious frontmen in all of modern rock. As I said in my comment for The Sound, that was the first song I heard from them, and when a song that good is your first experience with a band, everything else that comes afterwards is just BOUND to disappoint you, but even excluding that part of my experience with the 1975, their songs just flat out aren’t very good. Matty Healy’s lyrics have the complexity of an average r/im14andthisisdeep post and while their instrumentals are usually pretty decent, they lose their impact considering most of the song on this album sound nearly the same. And did there really need to be THREE separate ambient tracks? THREE?! fuck this band
