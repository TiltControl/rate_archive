"Don't wreck my reputation, Let me wreck my own" - Nicki Minaj Queen era

---
**gannade** (10): twinks can step off

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Miss Kacey I am already bald

**therandomsinger13** (9.7): Sup country reputation before reputation. Kacey got some solid burns going.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): very very very very very relatable song and i love it very much

**MissyBee37** (9.5): This is such a great way to say "fuck you." Maybe even better than the actual F-word. It sounds so light and upbeat but oh, no, honey. Don't miss these lyrics because they are meant to put a bitch in her place. I love the wordplay and the sass.

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.4): i struggled heaps with rating this one, but ultimately her storytelling skills are so nice and i love a good ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô song, she made this one for me. got some people i need to send this to.

**1998tweety** (9.2): This is such an anthem, and its super catchy too.

**itsnotrelevantt** (9): Love the twangy vibe with the High Horse-y message

**Leixander** (9): me to myself

**Shippy29** (9): okay this was very good and i feel like its different from everything else ive heard in this rate while also being very similar at the same time

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): She‚Äôs so classy! The song kind of relies too heavily on the main joke though, there aren‚Äôt as many fun barbs in it as there are on some of the other songs on the album.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I want to buy a truck so I can roll the windows of the truck down and flip people off while playing this song.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Kacey is not here for anyone's bullshit. Go her!

**christopher\_aia** (8): translation "GET OUT BITCH" this song has so many one liners I just can't

**lalodragon** (8): this is a High Horse preview, isn‚Äôt it??

**piccprincess** (8): Yeehaw Off

**shineflyer** (8): in this little ditty, kacey tells you to fucking die

**teresan527** (8): Even when Kacey is telling someone off, she does it in just a soothing way.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSUaHUluU8M

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): ugh imagine if this was uncensored

**vayyiqra** (7): This is nice, but i have nothing to say about it really.

**qetaz** (6): I like the opening, but this quickly devolves into a filler song for me. Not bad, just nothing worth mentioning.

Honestly Kacey this song is basically a personal attack on me. I am the worst offender of saying I'll do something and never doing it. When talking with people at work about their personal lives, I always just tell them what they want to hear. Arguably Kacey's most rock song, I wish she had more songs that sonically sounded like this because it goes off.

---
**gannade** (10): ‚Äúwe all say we‚Äôll quit some day and just sail away‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre just blowing smoke‚Äù omg kacey you didnt have to drag me like this

**lalodragon** (10): Another candidate for that 11. Another pointed description. This is more of a jam than Merry Go Round, actually. It‚Äôs more upbeat and boppy, but the songwriting isn‚Äôt quite as detailed.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a chill bop

**MissyBee37** (10): This is Kacey's witty, snarky lyricism at its finest. I love the story and the attitude of this song. The guitar is so great, too.

**rockysaytalk** (10): The storytelling on this is A+, the attitude is fantastic, the concept and execution is such a stand out to me

**static\_int\_husp** (10): country rock is always an interesting sound. I think the bridge makes the song.

**therandomsinger13** (9.7): Yes tone, yes storyline! And omg that bridge.

**skargardin** (9): I was not ready for a straight up BOP

**tapdancingpig** (9): This one rings true for me, as someone who grew up watching a bunch of people slowly burn themselves out on soul sucking jobs.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): i like the bridge

**ExtraEater** (8.5): cool title cool song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I love Kacey‚Äôs ability to create a world within her song, but don‚Äôt smoke kids!

**1998tweety** (8.3): I love songs with lots of storytelling like this one.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): yeah we're just blowin.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. smoke

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qL5P8nuDqc

**Shippy29** (7.5): this was a BOP wow dark edgy kacey come THRU

**twat\_brained** (7.2): Florence + the Machine did not write Between Two Lungs just for you to put them at risk like that. Then again she's currently fucking up the Atlantic coast of the United States so I guess she isn't in the right herself

**christopher\_aia** (7): classic example of a song I loved at the beginning and faded away with time

**Leixander** (7): i feel like her vocals are too low-key for the instrumentation here

**piccprincess** (7): Blowin Yeehaw

**qetaz** (7): A nice change of pace- it‚Äôs almost a rock song. More cynical and less wistful than Kacey usually is, and while I generally prefer Kacey‚Äôs soft, dreamy songs, it‚Äôs nice to have some bops as well.

**strawberryswing1** (7): Am I in an old west saloon?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): wow can you believe kacey is blowing secondhand smoke at kelsea

**ManofOranges** (6.5): I mean like, this song is fine and all but I kinda just don't care for it.

**shineflyer** (6.5): kacey steps into the saloon and orders a shot of whiskey. she's ready for y'all.

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): i initially rated this one much higher because it has a cinematic quality to it, but i‚Äôve always struggled to like #realpersonproblems songs. they never sound genuine, and knowing now that kacey goes on to make songs like high horse just make the sentiment in blowin smoke like, useless.

**itsnotrelevantt** (6): meh

**vayyiqra** (6): I wanted to like this because it started off more rockin' but I don't care for the lyrics. It feels like it's trying to be edgy, but it's not.

I remember first finding out about the term "silver lining" from the award winning movie Stuart Little 2. The bird Margot continually tells Stuart that every cloud has a silver lining. In the Playstation 1 game for the movie I remember it being a big recurring theme too. Silver Lining talks about finding the good in life, even when it's looking grey. While she fills the song with cliches, she spins them on their head and makes them fresh and interesting.

---
**JunkyGS** (11): This is my favorite song by Kacey ever. It is so bittersweet, universal and simple, but with depth. Her ability to twist cliche's on their head and give them even more meaning & appeal is one of her best gifts as a song writer.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Honestly Kacey is just showing off lyrically here, like we get it, you‚Äôre a songwriting genius.

**therandomsinger13** (10): Listened to this in bed and bopped to the best of my ability.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): i feel better about everything

**teresan527** (9.5): Queen of opening with a soft chill song.

**dramiaa** (9): This song is beautiful

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): honestly... this is follow your arrow but better and yall can‚Äôt handle the truth :gaycat:

**jamesfog** (9): A cute chill relaxing song

**perfumevee** (9): I feel this.

**qetaz** (9): a great introduction to the album. Gorgeous floaty production and clever lyrics- typically Kacey, making use of clich√©s without the song being clich√© itself.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I love Kacey's lyrics so so much

**twat\_brained** (8.9): The truly yeehawiest of all the songs in this rate, big ups to Kacey for making a country pop song that actually sounds country

**MissyBee37** (8.5): This is such a great way to open the album. It's not one of her best-best songs but it is indicative of her style, it's uplifting despite a touch of sad and it has a strong chorus. I also love the bridge. Even though the lyrics are full of literal cliches, she plays with them and strings them together in a way that makes them interesting.

**piccprincess** (8.5): Pure Yeehaw shit

**therokinrolla** (8.5): this is one of ha best album tracks but I think its gonna get robbed. Honestly the melody in the chorus is just gorgeous and idk why she hasn‚Äôt done it again tbh

**1998tweety** (8.2): This was kind of slow at the beginning (which is fine for an opener); I liked when it picked up at the end.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): a nice song. i like her voice a lot

**christopher\_aia** (8): always been a go-to song to cheer me up for years

**hikkaru** (8): (fuck a)

**Leixander** (8): nice bridge!

**shineflyer** (8): a breezy and kind song

**tapdancingpig** (8): Great opener! Not the best song on the album, but it sets the tone effectively and has intelligent lyrics (shocker!)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt_cbZjzuJw

**skargardin** (7.5): Cute, uplifting bop!

**lalodragon** (7): I don‚Äôt skip this song‚Äîit‚Äôs very good‚Äîbut I also don‚Äôt go looking for it.

**Shippy29** (7): i listened to this three times and wasnt really amazing by it

**vayyiqra** (7): It's nice enough, but Lykke Li remains unbothered.

Kelsea's album opener is her last song out of the rate. Fun fact: This was actually in first place at one point. XO was never actually a single, except one time I heard it playing while I was in Chapters and was kinda shook. While I'm surprised no one made any Gossip Girl comments, this song has some nice lyricism playing on xo/ex-oh, about being with a person who just can't move on from their ex. If Kelsea's whole album was as anthemic as this song was, maybe she would have fared better in this rate.

---
**rockysaytalk** (11): This honestly blew me away, especially when the last chorus kicks in! True banger

**gannade** (10): Kelsea‚Äôs album might be worse than Kacey and Maren‚Äôs but she has them soundly beat when it comes to openers. Imagine starting an album with a bop as massive as this, your fav could not

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): i didn‚Äôt have high expectations for this album. i‚Äôve heard some of the singles off it and i‚Äôve never really enjoyed them, but xo had me from the opening instrumental. i grew up with country music and categorise it in two ways: real country and ‚Äòcountry‚Äô sung by men. arguably country music celebrates and rewards female anger more than any genre, and there‚Äôs something dark to xo that makes me think it belongs alongside one of my favourite country songs of all time, miranda lambert‚Äôs gunpowder and lead. love it. by the way ‚Äî if anyone likes this song as much as i do, highly rec what i think is the best kelsea song, miss me more!

**jamesfog** (10): A major bop and a great way to start your album off!!

**MissyBee37** (10): I went back and gave this song an even higher score before submitting my final scores because it's actually in my regular rotation now, even though I'd never heard it before this rate. I legit love it. The play on words with the title is really cute & clever. There's an urgency to the sound of the music that I can't articulate but I love it. This is a strong way to start an album! I have a feeling this melody is going to be stuck in my head long after writing this comment (yeah, that proved quite true!).

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): beyonce fucking wishes

**1998tweety** (9.8): This is a huge bop, I love the rock edge to it. The fast singing bit is cool too, queen of 3 genres.

**twat\_brained** (9.6): Where's that GIF of Coco Montrese lip syncing to Cold Hearted by Paula Abdul? [Here it is](https://media.giphy.com/media/daVRk07prjuZa/giphy.gif)

**ExtraEater** (9.5): great lyricism

**christopher\_aia** (9): ok this slaps and the wordplay of the title is top notch

**ManofOranges** (9): Kelsey really went off with this one. This is a really good opener. I wasn't expecting to actually be impressed.

**martymcflurry** (9): this is my favorite kelsea song! queen of yeehaw rap

**perfumevee** (9): Catchy, easily the best song on the album!

**poppinmmolly** (9): yas honey

**rosesmp3** (9): this is a banger

**Shippy29** (9): a great opener to the album. very stereotypical country but it works great here

**skargardin** (9): An amazing opener

**tapdancingpig** (9): I thought Maren was doing blatant pop music and passing it off country, but this is literally a pop song with a Nashville approved guitar and banjo line and a country affect to her voice. Like, those lyrics are made to stick in your brain, and what country song does that thing with the way too fast delivery thing? Not only is it literally pop, it‚Äôs GOOD pop.

**therokinrolla** (8.8): a country pop banger? It may just be! I don‚Äôt understand at all what the title means I think she was trying to be clever but it falls flat but it doesn‚Äôt matter it sounds good

**Leixander** (8.5): i am confusion by all the different instruments and verses but yes?

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): pretty good "classic" country sound, ends to abruptly

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Beyonce found debuting under 5SOS

**lalodragon** (8): Good and catchy in the country music tradition of crappy relationships. It's not a life-changing song but it's going on my playlist.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): this was a cute intro, I guess

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Beyonc√© is shaking

**vayyiqra** (8): Wtf, this is a bop I love Chelsea Ballerina now.

**therandomsinger13** (7.9): Love this beat. The song is kinda cheesy, though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Kind of an unconventional album opener, it‚Äôs a good song but I‚Äôm not sure it really sets the tone for the rest of the album. Other than ‚Äúsirens‚Äù and maybe ‚ÄúPeter Pan‚Äù none of the other songs are really like this. Obligatory Beyonc√© outpeaked.

**piccprincess** (7): Ex-Yeehaw

**qetaz** (7): A bop. A bit confused though, because nothing about this says country to me.

**shineflyer** (7): insert beyonc√© joke

**ExtraEater**: tied for 2nd best, nice and cool lemonade

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a really cute album, and I definitely think it's on par or better than the other two (who I am expecting to do much better than Kelsea.) Kelsea feels more like a coffee shop/flower aesthetic singer-songwriter than a traditional country songstress, and I think blurring that line works really well. The production is distinct and sets the atmosphere for every song, and every song has a decent to good melody as well. I don't think this album is particularly unique or complex but it is very enjoyable! [Grade: A-]

**CreepyMannequin**: Although there are a few standout tracks, most of the lyrics on this album are rather pedestrian. The album makes for good background music but not much else as whole.

**rockysaytalk**: The true redeeming thing on this album is XO, the rest is mediocre at best and I kinda feel bad for her because the other debuts are much much stronger all round

**Leixander**: I doubt I will listen to this again but it has a few nice songs

**itsnotrelevantt**: I had never listened to Kelsea or any of her music, except for what I‚Äôve heard on The Voice (Peter Pan /eyeroll) by wannabe country starlets. It was a lot better than I thought it was gonna be, but I kept thinking the songwriting and production was excellent but someone with a more interesting or dynamic voice would make me love it, as it often felt too bland to me. Sorry Kelsea!!! Take a shot every time she says boy

**Shippy29**: This album is honestly such a dirty liar. It starts off with a great song and promises a good album, but then the album goes.... nowhere. the beginning sounds just like the middle and the end. theres NO evolution in the sound whatsoever, and after ive heard such good things about this artist i was honestly just very disappointed with how boring this album was to listen to.

**gowestyoungkanye**: average 5.2. it‚Äôs a bit soulless, honestly.

**lalodragon**: Kelsea is a pretty good paint-by-the-numbers country pop singer, but she lacks the songwriting skills of either of the other two. The others also have excellent and unique vocal deliveries, but the closest Kelsea comes is a kind of strained, exaggerated drawl. Listening to the album I‚Äôm constantly comparing her to other people (Little Big Town, Carrie Underwood, Brooke Eden, Miranda Lambert‚Ä¶) because there‚Äôs not much here that hasn‚Äôt already been done better.

**vayyiqra**: I liked this album the best out of the three, maybe because it's the poppiest and least country-sounding. Yes, I know that defeats the purpose of doing a country rate if I hate country, but I did it because I heard the rate was flopping and I wanted to help out. I tried to be fair and give the scores that reflected my true feelings. Most of this album is a light 7 for me but it did have a few bops on it. I felt it started strong and the second half started to meander and lose my interest, but she is a good songwriter and all of the albums in this rate have some good lyricism, which is their saving grace. I wouldn't have listened to this if it weren't for the rate and won't listen to it again but it is objectively a good album.

**MissyBee37**: I'm honestly surprised how much I enjoyed this album. I didn't really know Kelsea's music before, but I like her songwriting style, she has a pretty voice and all of it is enjoyable to listen to. I like her delivery; she's excels at expressing the right emotions for each song. At "worst," some songs are (IMHO) a bit cliche or forgettable, some are too country for my personal taste, but none of it is bad. I often delete albums I didn't already have after rates but I would definitely relisten to this! I realized looking back over it that a lot of my scores hover around 7, but I feel like that's what this album is -- a solid good from start to finish, occasionally great & impressive, but never bad. Just a nice, steady listen.

**HerculesMeow**: This album surprised me a little! I feel like it can definitely hold its own against the other two albums in this rate.

**Ghost-Quartet**: Okay so I know that my scores are so high for this album that it looks like I‚Äôm just a crazy Kelsea Ballerini stan and maybe there‚Äôs a grain of truth to that but also unironically adore (almost) every song on this album. (I literally don't care about the last three tracks.) Kelsea just brings out my inner country girl, every time one of her songs comes on I want to put on some jeans and drive to a dive bar and get married to my nonexistent high-school boyfriend way too soon because life‚Äôs short. I hadn‚Äôt really re-listened to *The First Time* since *Unapologetically* came out and because that album was so good (my #1 of 2017) I guess in my mind I kind of started to think that this one might have been bad but NOPE! It still goes off. I do still think that *Unapologetically* showcasese her better as an artist and fleshes out a lot of the potential that she shows here but I‚Äôll be damned if this album isn‚Äôt such a good time. It pains my heart that I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs gonna get a fair chance in this rate because the Kacey/Maren bias is so strong (no shade, I love Kacey too) and I‚Äôm kind of tired of always being the one stanning the least popular artist in the rate but I see you Kelsea. I see you.

**shineflyer**: overall, it just has that cheesy plastic coat that a lot of country I don't care for has. there's still two or three gems in there, though

**tapdancingpig**: I didn‚Äôt expect to like this album. I don‚Äôt like country that much, and every in the comment section of the original post seemed to think this was the worst of the rate. So I was genuinely surprised by Kelsea. This album has some weaknesses (the second half isn‚Äôt as good as the first half), but I honestly think that The First Time is better than Hero.

**perfumevee**: I really wasn't trying to rag on Kelsea here but I just did not love this album overall.

**ManofOranges**: I wasn't expecting this album to be so good. I think it is the most pop so maybe that's why I liked it so much but whatever. I think the biggest problem is that some of the songs suffer from being too boring, but a lot of them are really good as well. Overall, really solid.

**teresan527**: I love Kelsea and I love Unapologetically (her second album). This is a good debut album but there‚Äôs a few songs that kinda ruin the flow of the album. I already went through that when I made a comment on each song so I don‚Äôt want to rehash everything. But overall, I think Kelsea has a lot to say and the lyrics are pretty strong for the most part but musically and melodically they‚Äôre boring and uninteresting. It took me a while to get into a lot of the songs because they‚Äôre not ear-catching enough to grab me, therefore there are a few forgettable songs. However, I still enjoy the album. It‚Äôs a good start. I‚Äôm kinda glad she went a more contemporary route for Unapologetically. I think she made a lot of good creative choices in that album more so than this album. And that‚Äôs why they call it growth folks.

**twat\_brained**: The First Time I've voluntarily listened to a country album

teresan527: Okay soooo Kelsea got trashed in this rate lol

Final words: I highly highly highly recommend to anyone who did not love The First Time to go listen to Unapologetically! It is miles and miles better than The First Time. Kelsea is much more talented than what was shown on The First Time. She deserves just as much respect as Maren and Kacey!

This made sound cheesy but I was going through a break-up in October (November? Idk man, fall sucks) but I would drive around with this song blaring and honestly it was so fucking aesthetic. This personally is my favourite Maren single, it's stupidly relatable. The line "A long gone drive / You know the kind where you take a turn / and you don't know why / but it clears your mind, a surefire cure" is magic in a bottle. It's so simple, but whenever I'm feeling down or whatever and driving, I ALWAYS take the "scenic" route home and just take random turns and zig-zag my way home. I genuinely don't know what is better than a late at night drive at like 2am coming home (preferably in summer so I can have the windows down) from some shitty house party, or a friends house, or a midnight movie, and just letting the song guide you home. I don't often turn all sad boi, but this song is the perfect cure when I do. It is so cathartic in so many ways, and while My Church covers the "music is my gospel when I drive" more extensively, there's something about this song that just makes me melt. The song was marens first (and only) solo song to hit #1 on any chart, and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Solo Performance. Oh, also, fuck you /u/letsallpoo

---
**HerculesMeow** (11): I just really love everything about this song, from the lyrics to the melody and the bridge

**christopher\_aia** (10): This is the song that first got me into Maren, it is SO GOOD

**ExtraEater** (10): every time she says 'and a GUY....... and a GIRL" my heart breaks a little, also really good title

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): no other genre can tell a story like country music. no other genre. this is popheads, and i love pop music, but i‚Äôm also realist. it‚Äôs a continuation of the oral history / storytelling tradition and god, country has some of the best fucking narratives of all time which is why it hurts my heart when people, especially pop fans, dismiss it as being redneck music. a lil twangy guitar won‚Äôt kill you. but i digress. maren really carries on the storytelling tradition so well in this song. at first, in you're anything like me, you were a bit like, ‚Äòno, i don‚Äôt know this feeling‚Äô, but then, you were like ‚Äòoh, she put this into words.‚Äô the way she structures the song is masterful. it‚Äôs just such a fucking triumph, i love it so much. it‚Äôs peak of the genre and it‚Äôs not even about murder.



**jamesfog** (10): We love a smash hit ballad

**lalodragon** (10): The song I play the most out of the album. (I am a sad bi.) It shreds me. This was a contender for my 11.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented romance

**piccprincess** (10): Broken hearted Yeehaw

**rockysaytalk** (10): Honestly more people should love this song, I blame the awful video for that

**shineflyer** (10): this song feels like a big sigh; it gives the same sense of trying to relieve stress. and Maren's cynical, but really longing to not be. it's that desire and wish to feel better that gets to me. and that bridge has passion, I love it.

**therokinrolla** (10): Her most tender moment of her career, and the first time Maren has been openly in need of something she can‚Äôt give herself. Most of Maren‚Äôs ballads still have her in a position of control: Once shows her telling her man to not forget her, I Wish I Was has Maren announcing, however somberly, that she and her partner can‚Äôt fit. But ICUALS lacks the hope her other softer songs have, Maren is at the will of the music. This track may not necessarily fit thematically between the song before and after, but it sure enhances the effect of it.

**twat\_brained** (10): I currently can't think of any better song to give my 11 to and this one sounds very sweet. I also remember nominating it for a Popheads Grammy so more than anything I just want to see this song sneak its way into the top 5 by the end of the rate. EDIT: Never mind, I just heard 80s Mercedes in full

**teresan527** (9.5): Maren needs more song like this. I love her spunkiness but I love how soft and sweet her voice is in this song.

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song made me feel a lot more feelings than it had any reasonable right to.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Aw

**1998tweety** (8.7): The bridge really elevates this song.

**Leixander** (8.5): nice instrumentation

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a BIG grower, i really love maren's vocals on this

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): [‚ÄúI Hate Love Songs‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ46DXEQn-Y&frags=pl%2Cwn) is shook!

**itsnotrelevantt** (8): It‚Äôs a little bit boring but a better ballad than most

**Shippy29** (8): goodness i am pleasantly surprised by this album so far

**MissyBee37** (7): Really pretty vocals! The lyrics are so sad yet still hopeful; that's sweet.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): ‚ù§Ô∏è

**vayyiqra** (7): A recurring theme for me in this rate is that a lot of songs in it are just okay, pleasant enough but I wouldn't listen to them more than once. This has been one of them.

**qetaz** (6): Pretty but a bit underwhelming.

**letsallpoo** (4): a country radio #1 hit! all maren had to do was take away everything that made her interesting

NapsAndNetflix: **ImADudeDuh** (10): me when i get into a night time mood thinking about the guy i saw at the stoplight off main st and walnut rd and I imagine the full length of our relationship, from our meeting in a barnes and noble when we both reach for the final CD of Kacey Musgraves - Golden Hour available, and i shyly say he can have it after looking into his eyes, and he does that half-smile when he sees my cheeks turn a lightish red color. And just as I'm about to walk out without purchasing any items, he says "Well, do you want to come listen to it with me?" and even though I know I have spotify where i can listen to all music ever created except for The Heart pt IV, Garth Brooks, and certain songs off Fearless, I say "sure!" and I leave my baby blue 2011 Vespa at the store to drive off in his red 1997 Mustang. When we get to his affordable, 2-story home with a patio and a waterfall in the backyard, we put in the CD into his stereo that he has in the kitchen, next to his fruit basket with bananas, mangoes, apples, kiwis, and starfruit. When you listen through Slow Burn and get to Lonely Weekend, he says "It's always a lonely weekend for me..." dejectedly while looking out of the kitchen window while slowly putting his hand on the glass and slowly stroking it, clearly with some tragic reason, and you think to yourself "will this possibly come up at a later date for drama?" but Butterflies snaps him out of his depressed state and snaps you out of your curious state, and you both awkwardly laugh that off, and he brings up that this is his favorite so far. Which is weird, cause you just listened to Slow Burn and Lonely Weekend and Butterflies is like the bottom 3 on the album along with Velvet Elvis and either Wonder Woman or Mother, but Mother is more of an interlude so does it really count? but either way it's definitely with Velvet Elvis. But either way, he's such a cutie so you say "Yeah, mine too!" but in your head you're thinking about the awkward lyrical choices and the rather empty production. But you guys keep listening to the album, and you make some chamomile tea to give yourself something to do, and you make just enough for both of you with an extra cup of it leftover and it tastes good and calming just like some good tea should. And eventually you guys get to Rainbow, finishing off the album, and when it ends you turn to him to say "that was such a good album!" but he cuts you off... with a kiss. You're shocked at first and are about to put up your hands in defense, but you remember he's hot and you are literally in his house alone, so what did you expect was gonna happen dumbass? and you just let his mouth take over. You guys kiss for what you're gonna tell people feels like an eternity, but really it was just like 3 minutes and you know it, but when you guys break apart, you ask him to show him to the bedroom and he takes you there and y'all do sexual acts, but not like full on the dick gets pushed into anywhere, so like you're still a virgin and you can market yourself as one if this guy doesn't work out tho. So after 45 minutes, you're both done and laying in the bed together just staring at the ceiling and you're thinking to yourself "Thank god I didn't decide to get Nicki Minaj - Queen" cause there was a whole bunch of those CD's there and there would've been no fight for it that led to sex. Then he says, "So what's your name?" and you panic and you say a name that isn't yours cause you're so used to doing that on grindr and that one time you used Scruff cause you saw season 6 of Rupaul's Drag Race and honestly why was Vivacious robbed so much on that season? #AllStars5. and so you say "I'm David." And when he hears that name, he just looks at you, stunned. he starts breaking down and shaking. You calm him down but he's inconsolable right now. you think to yourself "fuck, I should've reblogged that inforgraphic on tubmlr about what to do if someone has a panic attack." but you didn't cause someone else previously reblogged it and said "If you don't reblog this, I'm judging you" and honestly who the fuck do they think they are to try and guilt you into reblogging something? fuck off. So you leave the room and get him some of the tea that you still have left over, and you heat it up a bit more and leave it on the bedside table. You say that you'll be in the living room even though he literally won't hear you cause he's having a panic attack right now bithc. but you wait in there, after getting dressed and then you just don't know what to do so you just sit there in silence. after a bit he comes out of the room with the empty tea cup. He sits next to you and says "I'm... sorry for that." you quickly say "No, don't apologize, it's not your fault" cause it really aint. he then says "I get so worked up over that name, cause it was the name of one of my past lovers. He was beautiful, kind, funny, and perfect. But one day, he was washing the windows in the kitchen, and I playfully opened it to scare him, but he fell from such a fright, and tragically... he broke up with me that day." "Oh" you say even though in your head you were like "thank god he didnt fucking kill him phew". But you look at him solemnly and nod. He then goes on and says "so whenever i hear it, I just have flashbacks to him breaking up with me and I get so sad." and in your head you're going "Oh thank god this wasn't gonna be one of those jokes that uses the term "triggered" like some guy on a dank meme subreddit." He then says, "thank you for the wonderful day, but I think it's time for you to leave and pretend this never happened." And you're sad, but understand and say "Ok, but you drove me here so can i get a ride back to barnes and noble?" and he says "ok" and on the ride back, it's quiet. you don't play the radio in case you hear any Kacey, jk lmao as if she gets radio play, it's just cause it's too awkward to turn it on now. but he drops you off and says "goodbye" and you just walk out and vespa your way home. when you get home, you go immediately to your bedroom, grab your headphones, and put on spotify. you then go to your sad playlist and scroll through Fast Car, Back to December and Vroom Vroom and realize that you accidentally put Vroom Vroom on your sad playlist so you have to remember to remove that later. but then.... then you get to I Could Use a Love Song by Maren Morris. and you just cry.

Maren's final single from Hero bangs hard. The carefree ease she has throughout this song is astounding. When she yells "SHIT, I'd be rich" I think we ALL felt that. "Every promise would have some real value" is such a savage and creative way to call out his shit. The video shows Maren in the wild west, and it guest stars her husband Ryan Hurd (who also makes some bops look him up). Honestly, everything about this song slaps so hard, and it definitely deserves its top 10 position. The only thing that surprises me is I thought more people would mention the "Ka-Ching Ka-Ching" backing vocalists. In the radio edit of the song, she makes them louder and it should have always been that way. The Ka-Ching girls really heighten the chorus in my opinion. The second last chorus where it's more stripped, before breaking out into an anthemic pre-chorus is honestly peak music. If you didn't do this rate but are reading this, I HIGHLY suggest listening to this bop.

---
**dramiaa** (11): this chorus is so good omg, I wish I could make "shit" sound this good. Love at first listen

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Kind of obvious but by describing the flaws in their relationship as money she succeeds in not only describing all of the mistakes they‚Äôre making, she makes the actual relationship itself sound cheap, and I think that‚Äôs neat.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): this song... do you know how fucking cool it is to hear both ‚Äòprada‚Äô and ‚Äòshit‚Äô sung by a woman like that in a country song? it‚Äôs just such a fun song, fun premise, the way she sings it, if you haven‚Äôt screamed along to rich in your kitchen with your friends and start laughing so hard you can‚Äôt breathe, i would recommend it. seriously.

**jamesfog** (10): A smash hit single go stream and watch the music video

**lalodragon** (10): It‚Äôs the details and delivery that make this song so fucking killer. Flawless.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented capitalism

**poppinmmolly** (10): y'all this song is soooo much fun to sing along to. It hardly ever comes on the radio but I have the CD and it's a party every time I play this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): üí∞

**therokinrolla** (10): lets play ‚ÄúCount the hooks‚Äù oh wait you can‚Äôt there‚Äôs too many to count

**perfumevee** (9.2): Try not to get this stuck in your head!

**christopher\_aia** (9): maybe the most FUN song on the record

**ExtraEater** (9): fun in a song

**Leixander** (9): cowboy hat flew

**letsallpoo** (9): an npr icon http://apps.npr.org/best-music-2016/list/top-songs/

**martymcflurry** (9): "Shit! I'd be rich" deserves its own special achievement Grammy

**Shippy29** (9): okay ugh wig wig wig wig

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): shit

**therandomsinger13** (9): I like how it's not her bragging about these things and it's just metaphor thing. I don't know how to word that but I like the lyrical concepts.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Wasn't Maren at the Grammy Awards this year? I'd assume she'd be at some afterparty getting to hang out with Diddy then.

**1998tweety** (8.6): Watch the video, Maren and her husband are both very hot.

**ManofOranges** (8): Well she must be rich now after getting all that money from the middle.

**piccprincess** (8): Money Yeehaw

**shineflyer** (8): shit! (conservative southern USA outrage ensues)

**tapdancingpig** (8): Seriously, what country girl puts a ‚Äúla di da‚Äù hook in theirs song? Catchy as all hell, with memorable lyrics to go with it.

**MissyBee37** (7): I don't really personally enjoy this song for its sound, but I had to rate it fairly high because I like the lyrics & her attitude here so much. It's a clever idea to take the joke of "if I had a dollar for every..." and turn it into a whole, fleshed-out song, and she pulls it off with an attitude that's so flippant. Truly a kiss-off to this person (and even calling herself out!) rather than overly angry or heartbroken.

**qetaz** (7): This is clever, she really made the extended metaphor work. Her voice is also great.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): sonically this feels like maren's bro-country equivalent and while the "la-da-da-da-da-di-daaaaaa" hook is good, i don't think the rest of the song really works that well

**vayyiqra** (7): This album feels much more "alt rock with a southern twang" than country but whatever, it's alright so far.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): honestly like 50% of my scrobbles of this were just so it can get up on the coutnry charts and not cause i really like it. I feel like the money theme gets stretched way too thin for it to be really enjoyable.

**teresan527** (5): It‚Äôs fine. This song feels like a great track for a mid-2000s rom-com during the part when the girl is spending her beau‚Äôs money.

My Church is Marens debut single, and she came out swinging. A top 5 hit on the country charts, the song sounds like it's another Carrie Underwood-style gospel song, while in reality starts with Maren saying how she sins and that HER version of Church is driving down the road and listening to music. Maren says she never wrote this from a religious perspective, but instead a spiritual one. While some might say this is one of her most country songs, Billboard listed this at #15 for the best pop songs of 2016. Rightfully, it won a Grammy award for Best Country Solo Performance.

**perfumevee** (11): First song I ever heard by Maren while flipping through radio stations back in 2016. It took me in immediately. It sounded so fresh compared to a lot of what they play on country radio where I live. I've been a fan ever since!

**christopher\_aia** (10): I hate what country radio has become but she makes it sound so so good

**gannade** (10): I am LIVING for the fact that Maren titled this My Church to get her conservative country audience to listen to this song but then the song is not actually about a religious church at all lmaoooooooooooooooo

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Reminds me a lot of [‚ÄúJoyful Noise‚Äù by Shaina Taub,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2kKfWieXPI&frags=pl%2Cwn) one of my favorite songs by her. I love alternative explorations of religion, down with the establishment.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): before i ever heard my church (the only maren song i had heard before molly put craving you in the charity rate), it was like, not this bullshit again. i don‚Äôt want to hear about your church unless you‚Äôre attending a funeral for the man you murdered or you‚Äôre johnny cash singing god‚Äôs gonna cut you down. of course, ‚Äòmy church‚Äô begins with ‚Äòi‚Äôve cussed on a sunday‚Äô and from there it only gets better. i think anyone obsessed with music will get it. maybe not even obsessed, merely finding solace in it from time to time. i know i do. and she sound glorious on it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Her debut single, country peak, a modern classic country song.

**itsnotrelevantt** (10): Some of the melodies on the prechorus/early chorus really get to me and carry the song to one of my faves on the album

**jamesfog** (10): A grammy winning song! Grammy winner Maren Morris is in good company with Grammy winner Daya and Grammy winner Meghan Trainor.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented religion

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): suddenly im christian

**TragicKingdom1** (10): insanely good melody and atmosphere, this is the song that really got me into country back in 2016 and in a rate that wasn't so incredibly strong this would be my 11. but alas, mine went to a different maren song

**piccprincess** (9.5): YEEEEEEHAW

**therokinrolla** (9.3): possibly her most country song, and the biggest hit in this entire rate, my church subverts whatever expectations you had coming into it and preaches to you not about Princess Jesus Christ and the 7 Deadly Dwarfs but about the simple power of a fuckin BOP on the radio

**therandomsinger13** (9.2): I've heard a bunch of covers of this, but I haven't heard the original much. Again, lyrics are great. Girl country lyrics are usually great.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): *patrickpraying.jpg* Also how'd this win a Grammy and not "Love Song" or "80s Mercedes"?

**lalodragon** (9): This is the song that got me in to Maren. I‚Äôm a sucker for appropriating church language, and a sucker for driving songs, so call me lolly I‚Äôm popping off

**ManofOranges** (9): Maren really took me to church with this one..

**rockysaytalk** (9): This is such a perfect song to drive to and that's exactly what she was going for, A+

**1998tweety** (8.7): I predict this song is gonna get dragged cause of its title even though its not even that religious

**martymcflurry** (8.5): grateful for this song for giving us Maren and for being the perfect driving song

**Shippy29** (8.5): tbh i prefer when kelly clarkson sang it at that awards show she hosted and ariana performed no tears left to cry at and first teased the light is coming but its cute with maren too!!!

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I feel like a bunch of church ladies just heard parts of the lyrics and that propelled it to the top ten of the country charts. It‚Äôs a bop, though.

**dramiaa** (8): Her voice scalped me

**ExtraEater** (8): godo

**letsallpoo** (8): i like this song a lot but it really was a horrible decision for a lead single. i remember i tried playing this for my friends and they asked me why i put on a gospel song. the random person listening along on the radio wont understand whats going on!

**qetaz** (8): I can picture myself singing this driving along, just like in the song ÔÅä I particularly like the breakdown bit with all the harmonies

**Leixander** (7.5): this is a christian subreddit

**MissyBee37** (6.5): I don't really like this song, but I do feel the lyrics in a big way. My car has always been my "church," or my genuine friend for a long ride in every mood. I just wish I enjoyed the gospel-country sound here but I don't. :/ Sorry Maren.

**rotating3Dtext** (6): sorry but religion makes me uncomfortable

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): ‚õ™Ô∏è

**vayyiqra** (6): Don't think I am the target audience for this, but I can see this appealing to country stans.

**shineflyer** (5): this is one of the big songs on the album, and yet... idk it's way too corny, man

MissyBee37: I like the "pretentious" explanation! It's helpful. Honestly, sometimes I miss concepts like that. I probably wasn't giving the album the full attention it deserved to pick up on the theme throughout as opposed to just considering individual songs. I feel that way about a few albums, so I get it! Thanks for the tips! I will definitely give it another listen.

teresan527: I really recommend just jumping into the album as a whole. I will be honest that I only loved a handful of the songs for months and then I fell in love with more and more each time I went back. I think Ghost pretty much covers all the highlights but my favorites are Music, Graveyard, In Between. If you like Taylor Swift, particularly Style then you'll enjoy Roses.

MissyBee37: "Style" is amazing, so I'll definitely look for "Roses" next listen. "In Between" was my immediate favorite, the only one that stood out to me (so far); I loved that one. Thanks for the tips! I definitely need to listen to it again after reading everyone's comments.

Popheads favourite Maren song. While, not necessarily a country song in any way, it just missed the top 10 on country charts peaking at 11. I do really love the line "Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink" which on surface level sounds like they're pink Ray-Bans, maybe she's wearing pink idk. It's actually a reference to Molly Ringwald in the movie Pretty In Pink, who (as Molly Ringwald always is) was the hot cool girl who wore Ray-Bans. Maren says she was going to name drop Ringwald, but figured that would take the comparison overboard and that she'd let the subtlety speak for itself. Unrelated but I went to school with a guy who fucking loved cars. Just absolutely adores them. He knocked a girl up at 18, and since he loves mercedes benz so much he named their son Benz. Not Benjamin with a nickname of Benz, not Ben with the nickname Benz, but straight up Benz. Anyways, he's 6 now and it still annoys me. Sorry to any Benz reading this.

---
**1998tweety** (11): I know this is a country song but I love the huge pop song chorus, and I appreciate that it takes time to get there cause it makes it feel more rewarding.

**gowestyoungkanye** (11): ‚Äògot them ray ban shades / pretty in pink / call me old school but hey / i‚Äôm a nineties baby in my eighties mercedes‚Äô i am so deeply fucked up and this song makes me so happy. it makes me sing. i think that‚Äôs 11 worthy. that‚Äôs really it, isn‚Äôt it.

**hikkaru** (11): I‚Äôm always a slut for a pulsating synth

**itsnotrelevantt** (11): It‚Äôs impossible not to love this song come on we all knew it

**jamesfog** (11): This is the greatest country song of all time.

**martymcflurry** (11): sorry to be predictable but this is THE banger

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): my wig is flying at the speed of her benz

**therokinrolla** (11): One of my favorite songs ever. My favorite country song ever. A song that until the end of time I will call a piece of pop perfection. Every line here is meant to snatch your eardrums and deliver something new, and no part of the song hangs around for long enough for it to get stale. And God the hook, the mfin euphoric hook. All the internal rhymes within the chorus, the way that ‚Äúturnin every head hell I aint even trying‚Äù so smoothly rolls off her tongue and makes her one of the coolest singer-songwriters we have today makes this a track of utter confidence and bliss. I will never be unhappy when this song is on. Its pure ecstasy.

**twat\_brained** (11): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_24_Hours_of_Le_Mans Wow this fucking bangs; it's a song that not only sounds better than the others in this rate but is an absolute tune! Literally invented the German automotive industry if you ask me

**christopher\_aia** (10): the pop girl prophecy started here, not with the Middle

**dramiaa** (10): I cant relate to this song at all but this shit slaps! yeehaw

**ImADudeDuh** (10): sue me, but this would make a great LSFYL imo

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented four-wheel drive vehicles

**piccprincess** (10): FINE ROKIN OKAY this song is a 10 without you making me give it a 10 yeehaw

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is suuuuuuuch an 11 but I'm only allowed one. I can listen to this song on repeat and not get tired of it and I honestly cannot say that of any other song.

**skargardin** (10): Maren should really go pop full-time!

**teresan527** (10): I‚Äôll be honest and say that I did not immediately love this song when I heard it a while ago before Maren blew up. I knew this song was gonna be the first song I want to listen to when I did this rate and I love it.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): commands you to keep listening from the first beats, also good title

**rickikardashian** (9.5): Okay but this song is like real fun. This is the female equivalent of country guys singing about their trucks.

**therandomsinger13** (9.5): Catchy, singable, fun. This is a good one.

**gannade** (9): A good song but the twinks might make a pop song win a country rate so I can‚Äôt give this a 10

**Leixander** (9): too merican fo me

**letsallpoo** (9): [NOT COUNTRY]

**rotating3Dtext** (9): i'm a 90s baaaby, in my 80s merzaaaydis

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): üöó

**lalodragon** (8.5): hire me to write an article on the sonic devices in this amazing bop

**shineflyer** (8.5): a lot of country songs don't know how to use synths and still feel country. this song gets it. the synths work as that 80s throwback, but the country elements are still 100% there

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): "feel like a hard to GET starLET" is a very strong hook but the song doesn't really develop beyond that. this is a big bop but not one of maren's best!

**ManofOranges** (8): I know a lot of people like this song, and don't get me wrong it is good. But I don't really think that it's anything that special.

**tapdancingpig** (8): DAMN THE GIRL SNUCK DWYW SYNTHS INTO A COUNTRY HIT

**vayyiqra** (8): This song was hyped up too much before doing the rate but it is undeniably a bop. As a 90s bxtch myself I'm into it.

**MissyBee37** (7.5): This is a lot more fun than I expected lol! I thought it'd be cheesy but it's super cute.

**qetaz** (7): Cute. Her songs all have a lot of personality which I love.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This is like, the big hit of the album I guess and it‚Äôs alright. There‚Äôs this weird droning sound to it and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to refer to yourself as a ‚Äò90s baby without it being a little cringy. And the bridge just kind of isn‚Äôt there? Actually the more I listen to it it‚Äôs kind of annoying? That guitar in the background just sounds so scratchy and the drums are obnoxious. Maren is just kind of screaming at points and she‚Äôs gurgling her vowels in a really annoying way‚Ä¶ wow the score for this song really dropped as I wrote out my thoughts on it. Tbh I‚Äôm a little scared to give this a low score but I‚Äôm sticking to my guns here.

NapsAndNetflix: # Hero

**Overall average**: 7.848

[All Averages](https://pastebin.com/M1PrU7wL)

**ExtraEater**: best

**TragicKingdom1**: I really love every aspect of this album. Maren honestly has one of my favorite voices in music right now; she's incredibly expressive and distinct. She has a real talent for songwriting, and I especially love her usage of onomatopoeia hooks on what feels like most of the songs. The production is incredibly diverse for a country album and covers every style that you hear on country radio. There are some slight skips and misses, so the album isn't perfect, but I would highly recommend it as the first stop for any pop listener looking to get into country. [Grade: A]

**therokinrolla**: The album that made me a full on country fan tbh. Before sure I liked country Taylor (sans self titled), kinda liked Kacey, and of course LOVED the standard gay country anthems (Before He Cheats and Jolene), but this, a whole album of country bangers, tender ballads, and a piece of country-pop perfection? Whew. This album oozes attitude and fierceness: with every curse dropped like its nothing more than a pronoun, with every hook menacing, with every line referring to men as TRASH this album carries you through feeling like a badass.

**christopher\_aia**: I knew of Maren but never got into her until about a year ago. I love this album so much and I think she's so promising.

**rockysaytalk**: Maren won me over with her voice on this, she is stunning. The album just drags a tad, could lose the last 2 or 3 songs and it would be much more compact.

**strawberryswing1**: While I instantly liked Kacey's album, it took a few listens for me to appreciate this one. Still, it dragged towards the end and there is definietly filler.

**Leixander**: Pleasantly surprised, this is a really nice album.

**itsnotrelevantt**: So I thought I didn‚Äôt know Maren but I‚Äôve heard a lot of these songs on the Voice too and a random Youtube pop/country dive once. This album started out really strong and never stopped. I think I really like Maren?? Her voice is wonderful and even the less audibly exciting songs sound great.

**Shippy29**: now THIS album was quite a surprise. it was pretty fun to listen to and see where the sound was going with each sound. its definitely got some filler but its a solid album.

**gowestyoungkanye**: average 8.4, i absolutely love this album.

**lalodragon**: Maren is on point. 7.5 average. I actually noticed while averaging that Maren and Kacey both got a TOTAL of 104 points, but Maren‚Äôs was spread out over more songs. The album could have been improved by leaving a few of the lesser ones off.

**MissyBee37**: I didn't really enjoy this album, but I have to respect Maren's craft. I can recognize that she's good at what she does, even if it isn't for me. I like her lyrics far better than her musical style. She has more attitude and perspective than I expected from a fairly shallow song like "My Church," which was pretty much all I knew of her besides "The Middle" before this album. (How she made that song after this album, I'm more confused about than ever before.) I respect Maren and I see why people like her, but she isn't my cup of tea.

**Ghost-Quartet**: Maren surprised me. It‚Äôs not that I thought this album would be *bad,* but it was the only one in the rate that I hadn‚Äôt listened to before and I rank the other two very highly, but this definitely held its own. I don‚Äôt quite stan Maren in the same way I do the other two, but I loved *both* of their sophomore albums so if Maren can manifest that energy then I just might have to!

**shineflyer**: this got overhyped by some of my friends (who know who they are) but it still really does some great tracks on it

**tapdancingpig**: I did not expect to feel as mixed about the album as I did. The first few tracks are great and there are a few deep-cut highlights, but so much of this album is dull as hell. The production is pretty strong, and Maren‚Äôs a good singer, but the melodies and lyrics aren‚Äôt there.

**ManofOranges**: This is a solid album as well. Maren is really coming for all these pop girls. I do think it has a some filler obviously, but the filler isn't that bad. What I call forgettable can still be a masterpiece for others and that's probably the case with this album.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: this was one of my favorite discoveries the past 2 years. I first heard ‚ÄúMy Church‚Äù on Beats 1 Radio, and I have not been able to get it out of my head since then. The entire album is a blast and I cannot wait for what Ms. Maren has in store for her fans in the coming years.

**teresan527**: This album really took me by surprise. I did this rate because I love Kacey and Kelsea. I‚Äôve been following Kacey since the beginning and I love Kelsea‚Äôs second album, so I went into this completely new to Maren. The only thing I‚Äôve heard from Maren was Seeing Blind by Niall Horan (whoops at me) and The Middle obviously. I love the rock influences that are sprinkle throughout the album. I think Maren has a lot to offer, for both country and pop. I think she‚Äôs a strong vocalist with a lot of range. She does a good job with the fun upbeat songs but she‚Äôs capable of pulling back for the softer songs. I don‚Äôt think this album is a homerun, but it‚Äôs a really strong debut. I can‚Äôt wait to see what her next step is.

**rickikardashian**: Easily the best album out of the 3. Marren straight up has star potential. Her tracks have such a captivating personality that leaves you wanting more. She has the ability of writing personal touching songs, like Once, and funny catchy songs, like Rich and 80‚Äôs Mercedes. I really hope she continues to get bigger, stream The Middle. Also I need to add, the cover would be amazing if it didn‚Äôt have the tracklist on it like‚Ä¶ was it rlly necessary to put it there? I could just flip the album to see it.

MrSwearword: We have reason to believe this marks the first time since Kanye West in both the TLOP vs. Views vs. Coloring Book vs. Blonde rate *and* the MBDTF vs. GKMC vs. Channel Orange rate that a 1,2 punch on the podium has transpired and that Kacey Musgraves may be the first female in Popheads Rate HERstory to have achieved a 1,2 punch on the podium.

**UPDATE**: upon review, wailord is indeed right that Kesha had the first female 1,2 punch which means Kacey Musgraves is the first country artist to have attained this feat.

Also, it should be noted a 1,2 punch = artist A, artist A and artist B

Podium sweep is when one singular artist has all the top 3 to themselves and only Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Arctic Monkeys have attained this feat.

oh wow a TWIST. I bet most of you expected this to win! Well, it was only winning for like one day lol. It was in fourth at one point once and I was lowkey hyped about it. Performed at the Grammys, this song tackles the double standards everyone faces in life. It tells you to just be yourself, do what you want, and fuck everybody else because you'll never make everybody happy. A lot of you might think this was the big grammy winning song, but that was actually Merry Go 'Round. Follow Your Arrow wasn't even nominated for any grammys. This song has a weird reputation of "ending" Kacey's career due to conservative radio stations not playing it due to the pro-gay lines. As far as I can see, it never really happened. The only controversy with this song is when Kacey performed this at the 2013 CMA's and they bleeped the word "roll up a joint" due to it being controversial. It's funny how times have changed in 5 years, because Florida Georgia Line reference weed fairly often now and would never be censored, same with Brothers Osborne. Also, Kacey says she originally wrote this song for Katy Perry. Katy rejected it, and told Kacey she would sound better on it. Whether was showing Witness era levels of stupidity by not taking it, or Teenage Dream levels of niceness to have Kacey keep it is up for you to decide.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): it's ok

**piccprincess** (11): this song literally has me in tears every time I hear it. It's so powerful and when it was released I remember how big of a deal it was

**skargardin** (11): There‚Äôs so much that I love this song for. Most notably, it‚Äôs got Kacey‚Äôs signature songwriting excellence all over it and then there‚Äôs the message. The country genre is no stranger to uplifting songs about embracing you for who you are but here Kacey goes on the specifics, pointing out religion, body issues and same-sex relationships and alcohol consumption! And that‚Äôs something that‚Äôs rarely heard of in country music so major props to her for that. There‚Äôs also the cute adlibs in the chorus that gives the song an extra level of playfulness. It really feel like an anthem for all those small-town (or metropolitan as well!) people who somehow feel different or not enough to just not give a fuck about what anyone else says. I relate to this track on soo many levels. She really snapped with this one! It overtook High Horse as my favorite Kacey songs period.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This song is an anthem. Probably the poppiest song in this rate and a gay anthem, it's no suprise this song had lots of praise on this sub even before Kacey released her album earlier in the year. Maybe my facorite country song of this decade.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u--Sk34lPVQ

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10. When this was released I wasn't a huge fan of country, but this like the one country song I loved.

**christopher\_aia** (10): the hit homophobic country radio never wanted

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): An obviously legendary and iconic gay anthem. The way that my voice class worked at my college is that I have to learn eight songs over the course of the semester and then for my final I have to sing two of them in front of a panel of professors, one that I select and one that they select. I picked ‚ÄúHellfire‚Äù from *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* and when I finished they looked at my list of songs that I had prepared and were like ‚ÄúI would love to hear him sing Kacey Musgraves‚Äù and I messed up the first verse so I asked them if I could start again and I did and I ended up passing that class and that completed my voice requirements and now I can graduate so the point of this story is that Kacey Musgraves is a gay ally who takes direct action to help young homosexuals succeed.

**itsnotrelevantt** (10): Contender for my 11 but I can't resist 80s Mercedes forgive me Kacey

**jamesfog** (10): A Grammy winning anthem, Queen of gays.

**JunkyGS** (10): Freed every yee haw gay and legalized weed.

**Leixander** (10): so fun yet so calming yet so thoughtful, an easy 10

**ManofOranges** (10): Kacey came for the whole country genre with this song. Love that.

**martymcflurry** (10): homophobia ended thanks to miss musgraves

**MissyBee37** (10): I absolutely love what this song does for the issues it mentions. I love the way she bravely calls to task the hypocritical and just plain critical nature of our society waffling between punishing others for being too much or not enough of everything. And in true Kacey fashion, she's not too bothered by any of it and encourages us not to give a damn, either. She's right! The catchy melody and playful music are fun and charming, too. Follow your arrow is a beautiful sentiment. The bridge wraps it all in a pretty bow, and even nods back to the far more cynical "Merry-Go-Round" -- as if to say, you just get one trip round the sun, so the merry-go-round stops eventually; might as well enjoy the ride, your way.

**perfumevee** (10): Love this one!

**teresan527** (10): Of course, Kacey got country music shook.

**therandomsinger13** (10): First song I heard from Kacey it‚Äôs so good. Fantastic points. It did make me think she was gay for a little bit and I was disappointed to learn she wasn‚Äôt. Still a great song. What a fun little anthem.

**therokinrolla** (10): friendly reminder that Kacey says something about kissing boys once on her song and shes suddenly a gay icon but maren morris frequently bashes homophobes on her Instagram and doesn‚Äôt get any credit. But also this song bangs so.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this is my winner pick and it would be incredibly deserving. i don't really care that it's pandering to liberal audiences because even pandering is a major step for country music and it has a great melody and groove regardless.

**twat\_brained** (10): That is a really great fakeout on the second lyric about premarital sex. Instant 10 if you ask me. I'll stick around and finish this, however, because I like the message it's sending and I absolutely adore the instrumentation, especially the slide guitars; a cute nod to the country music of yore.

**Shippy29** (9.5): this is a top kacey song and was the one that i first downloaded from her. its not quite a 10 because i just dont think it really has that extra thing in it to deserve a ten, but it does deserve the highest score in my rate

**ExtraEater** (9): really good title

**lalodragon** (9): The song is kind of more on the nose than I wish it was.

**rockysaytalk** (9): This is a great song lyrically, but I feel the melody could be improved which would elevate the song.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): that's a cool message

**gannade** (8.5): gays won and lost

**shineflyer** (8.5): "gay country," they say. you fools. country was gay all along. reba didn't die for this

**poppinmmolly** (8): a great song about accepting that you shouldn't spend your life trying to please people but ugh I'll be so annoyed if this wins.

**qetaz** (8): Cute song with a cute message. You can just tell she had a lot of fun making this- you can hear her smile when she sings ‚Äú-rrible person‚Äù and I love it.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Adorable ‚Äúdo what you want‚Äù (but not with her body) song.

**vayyiqra** (7): I was not expecting a woke song on this country album. I don't want to overhype it, but I appreciate the message of it. The genre could probably use it.

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): i went on a journey with this song. i initially rated it higher, then lower, before settling here. and this will be controversial, i know, but i get extremely hung up on one part that does the opposite of the song‚Äôs intent and makes me feel bad about myself. i‚Äôm hypersensitive to the things mentioned in this song, and i appreciate kacey‚Äôs sentiment, but i also don‚Äôt like generic inspiration songs. i don‚Äôt see much to separate this from square pegs or second wind, both of which i don‚Äôt like. like, at all.

Most definitely this! Rather than just rejecting the song, which Katy loves (she loves Kacey in general, they're pals), she wanted Kacey to keep it because she knew it would be a hit: "No, you gotta keep that one for yourself. This is gonna be really good for you."

Well, there we have it. Our rate winner. I remember the first time I heard this song I was talking music with a girl at work about music and she played this for me. I didn't like her though, she was really annoying, so I was like "yeah I guess this is ok" but made a mental note of the song and went home and downloaded it. I was OBSESSED. I listened to shitty lyric videos on youtube of Kaceys other songs after that, and then I went to HMV and bought the Same Trailer, Different Park CD like 2 days later because I needed it. This song was winning since like day 3 of submissions. Merry Go 'Round won the Grammy for Best Country Song at the 2014 Grammys. The somber song talks about the mundane life most people in middle America live, and the boring cycles we all get into. While this song might have been a predictable winner, there's no denying Kacey deserved to win in what is a masterclass of songwriting.

---
**christopher\_aia** (11): this song is a masterclass in wordplay and imagery and it makes me emotional every time I hear it

**ExtraEater** (11): i wrote a somewhat melodramatic review for this for another site but basically this: kinda soundtrack to my life! and i like it!

**gannade** (11): omg when this song first came out I was so SHOOK that it was actually successful. A country song that completely dragged middle America? This is the most savage song I have heard, and Kacey did it so effortlessly too. Her wordplay is at her strongest here, the way she plays around the word Merry is so clever. And to top it all off, its got some of her best hooks. Apparently the song was never meant as a drag and a lot of her fans could relate to it, but omgggg Kacey cut DEEP

**lalodragon** (11): This is the pinnacle of Kacey‚Äôs songwriting, and it encapsulates so much of rural America. I love the nursery-rhyme flow and the so pointed lyrics.

**Leixander** (11): i gave this 11 just seconds after it started, i am a sucker for the sad banjo sound (like in Sufjan's music) and it is so good in this

**letsallpoo** (11): I don't think this song has aged particularly well, but it felt like such a revelation when I first heard it over four years ago. I remember seeing a random post about her on ATRL, and despite knowing literally nothing about this Kacey chick, I decided to listen to this song. I was immediately entranced - by the lyrics mainly, but also the moody instrumentation that managed to be perfectly melancholy. The song isn't a damnation of smalltown lifestyles, but more of a passing observation that's guardedly apathetic much like the rest of the album. I don't listen to this song much anymore (its magic waned a bit after nearly 300 scrobbles) but it'll forever hold a place in my heart not only for introducing me to Kacey, but to the wonders of country music as a whole.

**ManofOranges** (11): Everything about this song is just so good. Kacey came for so many people with this song. She pulled absolutely no punches whatsoever. The lyrics are superb. All the different uses of the word merry/mary. The piano riff thing. The outro.

**MissyBee37** (11): This is one of those 11s that just had to be 11 for me, no question. This song is so, so brilliant. The merry-go-round metaphor and the way she carries it through all the variations of merry/Mary/marry is just absolutely genius. The titular merry-go-round alone would be a solid metaphor for life as is, but to thread it through all those homophones to weave a full picture? Wow. Just, wow. This is a masterpiece of songwriting that tells a story of not one person or family but society in general. In some ways she makes it specific to her roots, but it's also universal to people anywhere who have experienced the same vices on life's merry-go-round. The lyrics are nuanced and deep, telling just the right anecdote or observation to tell the stories it's trying to tell. I looove the outro, too; she didn't have to go that extra mile but she does and it packs a punch. The lyrics are the star but the music is gorgeous, too. It all combines to capture this numbness that's so poignant. This song is so pretty yet so biting in its honesty and cynicism. It's dark, bleak even, without offering any sense of hope, and yet somehow... the sheer honesty & relatability of it, and maybe the pretty, lighter sound of the music and nursery rhyme feel of the melody, keeps it from feeling too painfully heavy. It's the kind of song that makes you feel un-alone -- "same hurt in every heart." I wish I could give this song a 12.

**qetaz** (11): Beautiful melody, beautiful production, heartbreakingly insightful lyrics. Kacey at her best.

**shineflyer** (11): this song is the fear of what could happen being stuck in a small town. and it's kind of resigned to that fate. it's the acceptance stage in the stages of grief, and there's something captivating about that.

**teresan527** (11): I know most of popheads are probably going to give Follow Your Arrow the 11 but I personally think Merry Go Round deserves the 11. I was debating if I should give this song or Follow Your Arrow the 11 but I guess I love sadness and tragic songs or something because I find this song just so freaking good. Mary should be afraid of Kacey.

**dramiaa** (10): never thought I'd get emotional by the line "same trailer, different park" but here we are

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song makes me so melancholy. I think it‚Äôs the way those strings go up and down, you expect them to go a little bit higher and it always feels like they might, but they always dip right back down.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): this one really grew on me over the course of writing, but the mary-marry-mary-merry line throughout the song is so masterful.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Where were you when Kacey fucking murdered small towns everywhere?

**jamesfog** (10): The Lana Del Rey of country snapped on this one

**JunkyGS** (10): Drags small town culture to filth! This song deserves a place in the hall of fame and every textbook about song writing.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is woke pop country

**piccprincess** (10): Mamas üôãüíÉ hooked üòª on Mary Kay üíÖüíÑ Brothers üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hooked  on Mary Jane üçÅ And Daddies üòõüôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hooked üò© on Mary two üòàüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è doors down üè† Mary üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mary üôé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è quite contrary, üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We get bored üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so we get married üíèüíç And just like dust üå™Ô∏èüå´Ô∏è we settle in this town üèòÔ∏è

**skargardin** (10): This might be my new favorite song of hers!

**tapdancingpig** (10): This one had me hooked from the first line. Her observations of a typical rural family are accurate and cutting.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): ugh i really wish she had commercial traction beyond this song. anyways this isn't the strongest song sonically but it makes up for it with the BEST lyrics in the rate

**therandomsinger13** (9.7): Great points, Kacey!

**therokinrolla** (9.5): a scathing take on society and ended donlad trump huh

**1998tweety** (9): Kacey's songwriting is at its best in this song. I love it when artists use the same word in different ways.

**hikkaru** (9): Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive

**twat\_brained** (9): eyyyy she said the album title! Also did Kacey just look up words with the m…õÀêri homophone and throw it in a song? I'd say it worked since I'm giving it a 9

**itsnotrelevantt** (8): If I hadn‚Äôt heard this on The Voice I‚Äôd love it more yall

**Shippy29** (8): this is just like follow your arrow: the prequel tbh but its good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW57tLMcqt4

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): invented playground rides

**vayyiqra** (8): It's weird how relatable this feels when the lyrics aren't relatable to me at all. I admire that she wrote a song that's topical and looks at the uglier side of middle America.

NapsAndNetflix: # Same Trailer, Different Park

---

**Overall average**: 8.166

[All Averages](https://pastebin.com/wR8FeeQg)

---

**ExtraEater**: tied for 2nd best, texas vibes to the max

**TragicKingdom1**: This album is good but the weakest album in the rate imo. Kacey shows off a lot of talent and the general vibe is enjoyable, but so many of the songs blend together. There are some major highlights with the 2 songs people talk about though. This is definitely worth checking out if you've recently gotten into Golden Hour after all of the buzz surrounding it but it probably won't supplant that album in your rankings. [Grade: B+]

**christopher\_aia**: It's been a while since I listened to this whole album and it's cool to see how tones and moods link to her last album, her growth is so apparent

**rockysaytalk**: Kacey made a big impression on me, her lyricism is very impressive. I just wish she was album to elevate the melodies a tad, but the promise shows which we now get to benefit from.

**strawberryswing1**: This isn't a knock out of the park in the same way Golden Hour is. I enjoyed this one the most in this rate because it is such an easy listen, even for someone like me that doesn't like country very much. It's probably the only one that I will keep in my rotation, though Maren had a handful of good songs too.

**Leixander**: I already liked Golden Hour but this album is even better wow

**itsnotrelevantt**: I loved Golden Hour more than most albums this year and I listened to her other two albums because of it. I wasn‚Äôt suuuper impressed at the time but liked a few songs, but now I‚Äôm going in with some recognition and a more positive outlook, but I guess I‚Äôm a Kacey fan??

**Shippy29**: While i love Kacey as a person and i like Golden Hour, i was surprised to find filler on this album that sounded just like any other country song, especially after she had a string of songs that, while they used traditional country instruments, sounded unique. This album definitely foreshadows Kacey being more than just a regular old Country artist though. Besides that, the album was a treat to listen to, and is my second favorite in the rate.

**gowestyoungkanye**: this was a hard album for me to rate because kacey‚Äôs talent is undoubtedly clear from her debut, and i don‚Äôt wanna deprive her of it, but lots of it just isn‚Äôt for me. 7.6 average i think?

**lalodragon**: 8.7 average score, holy hell girl

**vayyiqra**: I feel this album is going to unfairly dominate in this rate because of all the hype about Golden Hour. Given that I didn't get the appeal of that album and I think I'm fairly unbiased, I wasn't into this album. My final rating was a strong 6 or so and that isn't going to make me popular with the Kacey stan brigade here, but it's my honest opinion.

**MissyBee37**: The first fun thing about rating this album was remembering that there are more songs on it than the 7 that I bought on iTunes years ago lol. This is not a perfect album and it has some filler, or at least a couple songs that I think are more forgettable, but it's a damn good album, and oh do the songs that stand out and shine truly shine. This album shows Kacey's excellence as a songwriter. She's not the world's best singer -- her voice is pretty and certainly good enough, capable -- but not impressive; it's her figurative voice, the stories that she tells and the observations that she makes, that makes her amazing. She's equally great at making you laugh as she is at piercing your heart & making you think. I like her best when she's having fun, but her ballads can really pull at your heartstrings, even if her slower melodies are weaker (and too slow), IMHO. I have to note that I only discovered Kacey because she was going to tour with Katy Perry, and Katy had tweeted about how awesome Kacey is. So among my general Katy worship, I have to be grateful to her for introducing me to Kacey!

**Ghost-Quartet**: *Pageant Material* was the first Kacey Musgraves album I listened to and it‚Äôs still my favorite, but this album is definitely in second place. Probably the most truly ‚Äúcountry‚Äù album in the rate, I really admire Kacey‚Äôs dedication to both the history of country music and helping to breathe some life into it. This is was such a great debut album because she really showcased that she could do it all. She made gay men listen to country music again. God bless you Kacey.

**shineflyer**: Definitely the most organic and traditionally country of the three, I love this album. It's so calming.

**tapdancingpig**: I expected Kacey to be a Carrie Underwood like belter. I generally like Carrie, but I can only take her in small doses or I get sick of her tone and oversinging. Kacey is not that. She‚Äôs got a lovely tone, and more importantly, her writing is absolutely KILLER! Her voice always works in favor of her songs, and at 40 minutes and 12 tracks, this album is close to the perfect length.

**ManofOranges**: Kacey really went off. Huh.

**teresan527**: Honestly country music does not deserve Kacey. She really is trying to bring something new to the table in country music and they‚Äôre having none of it. Sigh Taylor was the best thing to ever happen to country music and when she left, Kacey could‚Äôve been their savior. I understand that Kacey doesn‚Äôt have a lot of general public appeal as Taylor does or doesn‚Äôt try to push her image to the general public as much as Taylor, but even in the country music industry she‚Äôs kinda ignored. She got a lot of attention for STDP but since then it seems like country music is reverting back to that clich√© ‚Äúbro-country‚Äù, even Miranda and Carrie can‚Äôt help it. Ugh why they gotta do her dirty like that? End rant. I am so glad that I discovered Kacey in 2013 during her debut. Kacey is always there to tell me the truth. Or to give me a peace of mind. This album is great. Kacey is great at doing her own thing. Kacey is always the queen of relaxing, soothing music but when she wants she can give us a little spunk. I love her!

**rickikardashian**: The album is consistently pretty nice, I just feel like there‚Äôs not any moment where I‚Äôm blown away, it just stays alright throughout the album, there‚Äôs nothing that stands too much for me except Dandelion, just because I really liked the line ‚Äúyou always leave me crying, dandelion‚Äù. I understand how it won Best Country album, since it accomplish being a country album better than *other nominee that year* ^(~~im still salty at Red not winning anything, srry~~)

JunkyGS: [22 People](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6gahkc/rate_reveal_the_90s_rb_girl_groups_rate_day_1/) participated in the rate (with no extensions) when this sub had [22k subscribers](http://redditmetrics.com/r/popheads) which means .001% of the sub participated in it. 

This rate had 54 people participate in it when the sub has 54k subscribers (with several additional weeks added for people to participate in the rate) which means **the exact same percentage of people participated in it .001%.**

So this running joke is old when it is said in EVERY rate result thread, especially if you count this rate's winner and not mine when they the exact same amount of people participated in it percentage wise. 

Every rate winner and results are valid.

JunkyGS: This rate was the perfect bridge for non-traditional country listeners to get their feet wet with the genre. 2 super solid and 1 "non bad" albums with some great stand out tracks. I loved revisiting these albums and hope popheads reading this who didn't give these albums a try please do! You might be pleasantly surprised :)
