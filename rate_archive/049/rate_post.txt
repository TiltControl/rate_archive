[Hi](https://imgur.com/Qu81qQ7), welcome to the New Generation Country Girls Rate! Seeing the [positive reception](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5dizgu/rate_day_1_of_the_billboard_hot_100_yearend_list/) to country music on the sub, I figured I would suggest a country rate, and it was picked [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5ytwsd/rate_suggestion_thread/desulkw/) [away](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6m8vv4/rate_suggestion_thread_september_december_2017/djzvf11/) [with](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7dqw84/rate_suggestion_thread_january_april/dpzrymg/) [much excitement](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/83sb1e/rate_suggestion_thread_may_august_2018/dvk7ce6/)!
 
The three albums we're rating have all been critically acclaimed, and have a collective 9 grammy nominations, with 3 wins. On all three of the albums, each artist wrote every song. So let's dig out our cowboy hat and boots, and lets yeehaw!

##[Kacey Musgraves](https://i.imgur.com/oblrm0M.jpg) - [Same Trailer, Different Park](https://i.imgur.com/jcm6gty.jpg)
 
While most of you might have only become familiar with Kacey this year with her release of *Golden Hour*; *Same Trailer, Different Park* was released in 2013 with Musgraves writing and producing every song on the album. The album received universal acclaim, and was on 17 different "best albums of 2013" lists, coming in as the best album for The Washington Post. It won Best Country Album at the 2014 grammys, with *Merry Go 'Round* winning Best Country Song.

##[Kelsea Ballerini](https://i.imgur.com/6VepCeU.jpg) - [The First Time](https://i.imgur.com/j9uBlQT.jpg)
 
In May of 2015 Kelsea released her debut album *The First Time*. The album only peaked at 31 on the Billboard 200, and #4 on the country albums charts. However, the first 3 singles from the album *Love Me Like You Mean It*, *Dibs*, and *Peter Pan* all went #1 on the country airplay chart, becoming the first female to have her first 3 singles achieve that. The album gained Kelsea with a Best New Artist nominee at the Grammys.

##[Maren Morris](https://i.imgur.com/B5robXZ.jpg) - [Hero](https://i.imgur.com/zBjTCUE.jpg)
 
Seeing as this is a subreddit dedicated to pop music and not country, many of you may only be familiar with Maren from her 2018 collaboration *[The Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3mJkSqZbX4)* with EDM artist Zedd. However, Maren had been writing songs for artists such as Tim McGraw and Kelly Clarkson as early as 2014. In 2016 she released *Hero*. The album was very well received from critics, and was put on multiple year end lists. It was nominated for Best Country Album at the 2017 Grammys, with *My Church* winning Best Country Solo Performance. It also garnered her 3 more Grammy nominations. We will be rating the deluxe version of the album, which was released 10 months after the original and includes 3 extra songs.

##Rules
 
Ok, I'm assuming you've all done a rate by now - or at least are aware of the basic premise. However, if you haven't this is how it works:
 
* Listen to every song and assign it a value from 1 (bad) to 10 (good). Decimals are fine, but only to one decimal place. Why would you rate a song a 7.54 in the first place be realistic.
 
* You may give **ONE** zero and **ONE** eleven, these should be reserved for the worst and best song in the rate, respectively.
 
* Don't sabotage shit just because you want to be edgy and different - it ruins rates and is annoying and no one will like you.
 
* Poo has his really cool program that does like all the work for me, so please use [this](https://bit.ly/2K58mFv) prepared link to send me your scores
 
* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!
 
* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
* If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song, I WILL change it up until I stop accepting scores.
 
 
**THIS IS THE CORRECT FORMAT TO SUBMIT:**
 
> I Could Use A Love Song: 10 more like I could use a banger! ha ha!
 
**THESE ARE WRONG, LITERALLY ANY FORMAT THAT IS NOT LIKE ABOVE IS WRONG:**
 
> I Could Use A Love Song: 10: more like I could use a banger! ha ha!
 
> I Could Use A Love Song: 10 - more like I could use a banger! ha ha!
 
> I Could Use A Love Song: I'm giving this a 10 because it is a banger!
 
> I Could Use A Love Song: ten more like I could use a banger! ha ha!
 
**You can also comments on the albums as a whole by adding a colon after the title**
 
> Album: The First Time: For being the most pop this is the worst album!
 
**Don't do it like this or anything that's not like above**
 
> Album: The First Time for being the most pop this is the worst album!
