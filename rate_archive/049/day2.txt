My buddy was dating a girl once and most people HATED her. His family didn't like her, his friends didn't like her, it was a lot. I personally had no issues with her, but I understood why people did. Well, they dated for like 3 years then broke up. When they broke up his friends were fucking HYPED. They did the whole "man, she was honestly the worst it's great you broke up" thing, and shittalked her for a solid year. This was until they got back together. Just such an uncomfortable situation to shit-talk a girl for a year and say how you always hated her, just for them to start dating again. Anyways, they own a house together now and will probably be engaged soon. The moral of the story is we all know someone who dates a LOSER, and no one understands it. One of my best friends dated this drug dealer who ended up cheating on her with her sisters friend, and then she took him back and like girl please you're a police officer now. The guy actually went to rehab and doesn't smoke or drink anymore and is on the right path and is super nice so this actually ended up as a happy ending kind of. Also, I went to a OneRepublic concert with like 6 friends and we got blasted, and then went to karaoke after and he was there with some girl and looked happy and it was nice and he was sober. I talked to him but I don't remember the night so who knows how that went. Haven't seen him since.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): drag him sis

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented trash white girls like me

**therandomsinger13** (9.7): This fits perfectly in one of my playlists omg. coughcoughhalseycoughcough

**piccprincess** (9.5): Drunken Yeehaw

**therokinrolla** (9.3): invented feminism

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The opening lines of this song are so powerful, her mind. I absolutely adore the no-nonsense lyrics of this song, I have absolutely had to give these kinds of pep talks to some of my friends and she absolutely captured that sort of ‚Äúyou dumb bitch‚Äù attitude.

**jamesfog** (9): A cute bop

**lalodragon** (9): This song was made for tipsy white girl karaoke. Or sober white girl car karaoke. Or just me, all day every day, karaoke.

**martymcflurry** (9): an underrated bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): Queen of teaching us how to spell.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this bitch is calling me out in many ways and im not appreciating it

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I have a soft spot for songs about female friends telling each other that their boyfriends suck. It may be Boy Problems syndrome, but I love it. Plus this song bops hard and Maren is SUCH a pop lyricist.

**christopher\_aia** (8): excellent show of her humorous side

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): my favorite fergie song

**poppinmmolly** (7.8): wow is this me talking to my friends about their dumbass boyfriends.

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): and the ten streak is broken :weary: it‚Äôs not because it lacks that maren sass, drunk girls has that in abundance, i just find it to be of that really annoying twangy part of the genre i avoid when i can. it also feels like a lesser ‚Äòrich‚Äô. the messaging is perfect though.

**Leixander** (7): fergie found sober, big and crying etc.

**qetaz** (7): Made me smile for sure- the title confused me for a minute but this is perfect. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the third time he got a second chance‚Äù is great too.

**teresan527** (7): Fun, catchy song. I like it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): üò≠

**Shippy29** (6.5): the production was interesting

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): worst song on the album imo. too margaritavile

**vayyiqra** (6): This would appeal to the basic white girl in me if such a thing existed, but I'm afraid it doesn't so this is lost on me.

**twat\_brained** (5.7): I'm not one of those "swearing isn't ladylike" people. That being said, curse words in a song just for the sake of it feels like lazy songwriting. Also, why does Maren have to fill time by spelling out words? This one misses the bullseye due to an uninspired song structure

**shineflyer** (5.5): hoooow faaar is heeeaven

**MissyBee37** (4): I mean, clearly your pal needs to ditch this guy, but I don't think this song is going to convince her? It might just piss her off... I'm just not feeling the vibe here. I don't care for all the spelling and la-la's and na-na's. I also don't love the chorus metaphor. Like, I don't know, not all girls cry when drunk. Some just giggle a lot & talk louder. My ex-best-friend would act extra bitchy & liked to scream about sex when she was drunk. Anyway. Meh.

What Kacey's grandma calls "the slut song", we [slow it down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFVtb5_Pec4) for the album closer. So I was just listening to this song to figure out what to write about and I didn't have the album on repeat or anything so it went to album radio after it finished, and it just jumped to Dame Tu Cosita by Pitbull after and wow that was a JUMP. That being said Dame Tu Costia is a banger so everyone stream it now because Pitbull deserves HIT üëè AFTER üëè HIT

---
**Leixander** (10): indeed it is

**piccprincess** (10): YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAW

**therandomsinger13** (9.6): Nice little closer. ‚ÄúMaybe I love you or maybe I‚Äôm just kinda bored.‚Äù

**ExtraEater** (9): i do love how the album tackles a lot of topic and ends on a song called 'it is what it is', it is a good conclusion overall

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): As an album closer ‚ÄúFine‚Äù and ‚ÄúRainbow‚Äù both out peak but this is nice. I enjoy how she always ends her album on a quiet, reflective note. There‚Äôs a lovely sense of finality to this track, which makes it the perfect closer.

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song is a country ballad version of ‚ÄúMy Life Would Suck Without You,‚Äù but with way less Luke and way more intelligence. I applaud you, Kacey Musgraves. You have by far created the best album closer of the bunch.

**martymcflurry** (8.5): apparently her grandma called this the slut song lmao. another with a lot of e‚Ä¢mo‚Ä¢tion

**1998tweety** (8.4): The instrumental sounds like what you'd hear in a vacation to Hawaii ad.

**Shippy29** (8): oh i thot that follow your arrow was the last song on the album the entire time ive known it existed but this is actually nice and its very minimal instrumentals allow kaceys soft vocals on it to shine. 10/10 would listen again (but actually an 8)

**shineflyer** (7.5): can't argue there. (this is arguably the most country song in the rate)

**christopher\_aia** (7): meh, this song is good but she does it better on her second album IMO

**itsnotrelevantt** (7): it is what it is

**jamesfog** (7): And what it is is boring

**qetaz** (7): A nice dreamy song to close out the album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDi2lIg4Fzk

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): i ranted about the storyteller tradition for maren, but it also applies to kacey. this is a lovely little song, but it‚Äôs very middle of the road for me. bumped it up a few points for ‚Äòmaybe i‚Äôm just bored‚Äô. maybe i‚Äôm just bored of slow songs, kacey.

**vayyiqra** (6): My reaction to this really sums up my feelings about this album which are "this is nice but I can't see myself listening to it again". My wig is firmly ensconced on my scalp.

**twat\_brained** (5.6): What this isn't is it, sadly. I might be a bit harsh but the last song on an album should really make a statement. Kacey's statement, or lack thereof, is that we are all just floating through life and essentially, que sera, sera.

As a couple comments mention, Maren originally wrote this for Kelly Clarkson to be put on her Piece by Piece album. Maren then ended up recording it herself and putting it on Hero. This is by no means my favourite Maren song, and definitely shouldn't be above some other songs that are out (RIP I Wish I Was). An empowerment anthem akin to Fight Song or Brave, the song talks about using the hate you receive to fuel yourself and better yourself. Maren is fawkes, a phoenix RISING from the ashes. If you don't understand that reference it is Harry Potter and please do yourself a favour and go read all the books then watch all the movies then continue with this rate. One time my friends watched (at the time) all 7 movies in a row like the losers we are and it was a lot to take in at once it last over 12 hours but honestly it was a lot of fun chilling in sweatpants and watching movies with friends all day. Anyways, Second Wind is my Fight Song.

---
**jamesfog** (10): A Kelly Clarkson bop, shoulda been a single

**ManofOranges** (10): Whew this song is good. It's just so empowering. Also I think Maren's version is better than Kelly's. That's all!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented Kelly Clarkson

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i'm so obsessed with this melody ugh

**1998tweety** (9.2): Her voice sounds really different on this song, it sounds like a pop girl instead of country.

**christopher\_aia** (9): better than Kelly Clarkson's don't @ me

**ExtraEater** (9): catch my secOND WIIIIIIIND

**itsnotrelevantt** (9): A country bop?

**teresan527** (9): I know Maren wrote this song and it was given to Kelly Clarkson. I love it. I think Maren‚Äôs vocal worked a lot better than Kelly‚Äôs.

**twat\_brained** (8.8): If only this album had as much of a second wind as Maren got here. Hold on, maybe this is a prophecy for the rate; Maren will lose a few songs early but catch a second wind at some point, filling up the top 10 and sneaking a win with 80s Mercedes!

**therokinrolla** (8.5): Can you believe that Maren gave this song to Kelly who put it on her album, then later decided ‚Äúeh I want it back‚Äù and recorded a better, harder, more country version and made it the penultimate track on her debut album? I can, because she is a bad bitch.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ironically this kinda starts a real 2nd wind in the album

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Finally, some momentum again!

**Leixander** (7): nice but kinda filler, don't kill me molly/naps

**qetaz** (7): A bop. A bit cheesy I guess but she wasn‚Äôt relying on clich√©s so points for that.

**Shippy29** (7): i feel like this could be on kelseas album because its kinda boring ngl but tbh maren elevates it?? she puts a personality into her music that kelsea SEVERELY lacks in hers

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): üå¨

**vayyiqra** (7): I like the production on this? That's all I can say.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I was so into this during that opening verse, I was really excited about where it was going, but the rest of the song is kind of a letdown. It‚Äôs a little too paint by the numbers, lacking the nuance that the intro promised and the ‚Äúna-na‚Äù part feels a little bit like a cop-out.

**MissyBee37** (6): Not my favorite melody but I like the message. Love the metaphor throughout -- from second wind to all the flying/directional references to the paper airplane.

**piccprincess** (6): Second Yeehaw

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): i absolutely hate square pegs because it‚Äôs generic inspirational bullshit, and guess what, i hate maren doing the same thing. i do rate it higher than square pegs because maren‚Äôs voice is far more pleasant to listen to and there‚Äôs no annoying put on twang, and ‚Äògasoline on the fire‚Äô is a much better comparison than square pegs and round holes. and the na na nas sound good.

**shineflyer** (5): kinda sounds like a demi reject

Peter Pan was the third single from the album, and absolutely deserved better from you guys. It hit #1 on the country charts, as well as country airplay charts. While Ruth B. had a Lost Boys released to radio at a similar time, Kelseas song uses the Peter Pan metaphor to say that her boyfriend is immature and will never grow up. While sonically the song is light and almost airy, it's honestly kind of harsh with her telling him that he never takes responsibility for things and saying that he'll never be a man. Kelsea performed this song on a few different award shows, and all of them are wild. She played this at the ACM's [with Nick Jonas](https://www.metatube.com/en/videos/301603/Nick-Jonas-And-Kelsea-Ballerini-ACMs-2016/) (which gave us his iconic guitar solo at 3:13), at the Radio Disney Awards [with Daya as a mashup of Hide Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_KCYUgA20), and at the Grammys [with Lukas Graham as a mashup with 7 Years](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5bivh0).

**christopher\_aia** (10): I knew this song before and already loved it, the imagery is really well done and the fact that this came out in full on bro country time and was a hit is excellent

**ExtraEater** (10): interesting guy

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I love this song, I used to listen to it all the time. I can already feel that Kelsea is gonna get shafted in this rate but I hope that this one does well because it‚Äôs a fantastic song that absolutely stands up there with what the other ladies in the rate turned out. Kelsea can be inconsistent or unpolished at times on this album, but this is the song that proved to everyone that there was a talented songwriter lurking inside of her. The way she subtly compares this guy to Peter Pan with subtle wordplay is actually pretty clever. She easily flips around the classic hallmarks of the Peter Pan story to apply to this guy pretty delicately, it would have been easy to go over the top and too on the nose with it but she manages to do it with complete earnestness. Her wistful vocals are also great, however I cannot watch the music video because her delivery of her lines at the beginning and end of the video are so flat. I love Kelsea but this girl cannot act.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): bitch fucking SNAPPED! Kelsea fucking MURDERED this man. when she wrote "You'll never grow up/You're never gonna be a man" she was signing a guarantee that she was gonna snap on this track

**ManofOranges** (10): The superior song about Peter Pan. Ruth B found dead in Neverland.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I‚Äôm sorry, there are two things in this world I will always love: disses toward Peter Pan and well written breakup songs.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i usually hate these kinds of songs but this is p good... i guess kelsea invented disney

**1998tweety** (9.3): Wow 2 bops in a row, this album is starting very strong.

**jamesfog** (9): We love a song with a meaning!

**lalodragon** (9): Is it just me or does this song sound identical to Better Man?

**TragicKingdom1** (9): ruth b is shaking

**therandomsinger13** (8.4): Why have I heard all of these songs. I had trouble paying attention.

**itsnotrelevantt** (8): It‚Äôs obviously really good but I can‚Äôt give it higher because of how cliche and lame the idea of a Peter Pan man is arghhh

**vayyiqra** (8): Manchildren have been called out, go off queen.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): oh yikes was she dating a boy who stayed much younger than her? I mean if he looks young but technically doesn't age then I guess it's legal

**piccprincess** (7.5): Yeehaw Pan

**teresan527** (7.5): I guess I really wanted to love this song but there isn‚Äôt anything special about this song. I still like it. I think it‚Äôs a good precursor song for what‚Äôs to come if you listen to her second album because it has that same feel.

**rickikardashian** (7.4): It‚Äôs nice and all but like, you know this song was made only because she wanted to have a Peter Pan reference. It barely has a correlation to the song, and even then it‚Äôs just a stretch.

**qetaz** (7): Can‚Äôt decide if this is clever or a bit /im14andthisisdeep. It bops though, so I‚Äôll give it the benefit of the doubt and a seven.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): i hate peter pan

**perfumevee** (6.5): Pleasant but not overly interesting.

**shineflyer** (6.5): a bit cheesy, but i'm a sucker good harmonies

**Shippy29** (6): ruth b did it better stream lost boys

**static\_int\_husp** (6): lyrically tacky

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Disney is shaking

**CreepyMannequin** (5): Rather pedestrian.

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): it‚Äôs just dull to me, and the instrumental is dime a dozen.

**martymcflurry** (5): the metaphor is a little heavy handed

**selegend** (0): A bunch of shoehorned Peter Pan references? How innovative. I despise Peter Pan references in music to begin with. It‚Äôs guaranteed that the singer will mention ‚Äúlost boys‚Äù and Neverland. There are more interesting ways of complaining about your significant other‚Äôs childishness and lack of responsibility. This ain‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs lazy. The references are lazy.

ImADudeDuh: what the FUCK r/popheads i'm so mad

i'm glad i still have my morals and didn't sabotage but i am legit regretting being so easy on Kacey when i honestly thought their album was forgettable trash

if i'd known there would be so many kaceiers out here circlejerking them and so many Kelsea haters i would've been harsher but i'm just too nice i rarely vote below 6

anyway both Kelsea and Maren are being ROBBED especially Peter Pan that song is a bop and you know it

at least XO is still in I would die of laughter if it won over all this generic country shit

lol so American Idol runner up Kree Harrison does backing vocals on this song. Where are the backing vocals you ask? Well, very faintly in the background during the chorus she might harmonize with Kacey. Kelly and Carrie better watch out, because we have a new Idol queen! The first verse of this song is TIGHT. Those nights where you're alone and can't sleep, you wander the house for a minute then go back to bed, and just lay there listening to the house creaks, or thinking about someone. I'm undesirable, so this song isn't that relatable for me from Kaceys point of view, yet it makes me feel like I'm turning down girls everyday. Kacey did THAT and that's that on THAT bro!!!!!

---
**christopher\_aia** (10): this song has always wrecked me, she just captures that feeling of rejecting someone else SO WELL

**dramiaa** (10): This is now my ex girlfriend theme song. Thnks Kacey

**martymcflurry** (10): an underrated sleeper hit. this song always makes me emotional

**therandomsinger13** (9.4): Oof

**1998tweety** (8.3): A nice ballad.

**ExtraEater** (8): the way she says 'hell' wow

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): TELL EM MISS KACEY

**piccprincess** (7.5): Yeehaw to Yours

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): probably the best of the non-single ballads

**twat\_brained** (7.2): I was gonna make a comment about how this seems rather dull to me but I'll do as the song says instead.

**MissyBee37** (7): I like how she starts from the ex's point of view. That's an interesting way to write this.

**shineflyer** (7): nice enough to play when you wanna just chill out

**skargardin** (7): Kinda blends together with the rest of the album but not bad by any means

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYsT0uWhPNU

**vayyiqra** (7): This is the politest anti-fuckboy anthem i've ever heard, I guess.

**qetaz** (6): Kacey, you can do better than this. Hell/self is a really weak rhyme and I think it would have been much more effective if she didn‚Äôt repeat the ‚Äúkeep it to yourself‚Äù line at the end of the chorus. But Kacey doesn‚Äôt make bad songs, just song that don‚Äôt live up to her potential, so six.

Obviously Hannah Montana has a superior song titled I Miss You, but this one is good too. This song has a dreamy western vibe to it, and sounds Tarantino-like. The song has cute little references to other songs on the album, with the four leaf clovers referencing Silver Lining and "every arrow that I aim" referencing Follow Your Arrow.

---
**letsallpoo** (10): the stars are all lined up, every arrow that i aim is true.......but i miss /u/mudkip1

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just so good I really can't handle it. It's somber and skinny. It's great and gorgeous. It really just makes me feel like I miss that one boyfriend that I never had in the first place. Kacey really did that with this song ugh.

**shineflyer** (10): how does kacey manage to make her songs sound so dreamy. like. shit man. i wanna float away on a cloud

**skargardin** (10): I love how airy this is compared to the rest of the album, plus her songwriting really shines here. I looove it.

**teresan527** (10): Just a top notch ballad. I love it.

**therandomsinger13** (9.5): I like the melody.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Oh this song just *sounds* like a classic, it feels very old school. If I heard Patsy Cline singing this I wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye, good on Kacey.

**lalodragon** (9): SO SAD

**martymcflurry** (9): this song makes me want to live in the south. i want to live inside the song. i love when a song paints such a vivid picture like this

**1998tweety** (8.7): This song is very chill, I like it.

**christopher\_aia** (8): I love the melody of this one and how she balances being tough but tender

**qetaz** (8): pretty melody and I love the subtle harmonies in the chorus.

**rickikardashian** (8): cuz im a creep, im a weirdo

**tapdancingpig** (8): A ballad that wisely keeps its tempo from slogging. The melody is interesting, and of course the lyrics are sharp as ever.

**twat\_brained** (8): Cute and relaxing but Adele doesn't even feel a mild tremor

**piccprincess** (7.5): I Miss Yeehaws

**jamesfog** (7): Creep by Radiohead teas. The country Lana Del Rey strikes again!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZs1AHQBz24

**vayyiqra** (7): I zoned out during this so it clearly didn't grab me but upon relisten it's not bad.

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): an average score for an average song. i do love the arrow reference, it‚Äôs a nice little thread to later in the album with follow your arrow.

**Shippy29** (5): mmmmm tbh i mean it was cute

Ok I think we can ALL agree that Flo Rida's My House is better than this. Honestly, if Flo's was in a rate I assume it would have over a 10 average. It's a good thing this isn't Flo's though, because it gave every other shot a chance at winning. The writing of this song started with the line "If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you" and Kacey kind of went from there. Like 10 of the comments describe this song as "cute" and honestly that's the best way to describe it. It's a cute song about travelling in an RV with the guy she loves, and that home is where the heart is.

---
**twat\_brained** (9.7): YES. THIS is what country should sound like! Not the shitty "bro country" we see from Florida Georgia Line, Luke Bryan, Sam Hunt, and the like, nor the outdated styles of the likes of Garth Brooks or whatever Brad Paisley is doing, I guess, and whatnot. Just simple, moderately high BPM, heavy guitar strumming cheeriness about something in life you can look at and feel joy over. More country like this please.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.5): im gonna assume that‚Äôs her playing the harmonica. Alanis Morissette who?

**therandomsinger13** (9.5): Yes original song idea. Can this be me following people‚Äôs tours?

**ExtraEater** (9): reminds me of when i was helping a neighbor move houses on an innocent saturday morning in the middle-class suburbs and it felt like commercial folk music totally should've been playing in the background. at night, we got to have a celebratory bbq at their new house and it was a very fun, middle-class day in general for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Ugh Kacey made living in a trailer sound nice.

**ManofOranges** (9): This is a really cute and sweet song. I love it.

**perfumevee** (9): There is a slight old country vibe to this I like.

**Shippy29** (9): THIS WAS SO CUTE

**Leixander** (8.5): this not flo rida's house i am disappointed and i want my money back

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): The fact that this briefly makes me think of living in a trailer as a decent lifestyle is a testament to her writing ability.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I'm torn between this being corny as fuck or sweet as fuck, but either way, Flo Rida outpeaked

**jamesfog** (8): Legend Flo Rida outsold

**martymcflurry** (8): this song is so damn cute and romantic

**piccprincess** (8): My Yeehaw

**shineflyer** (8): folksy! imma throw a harmonica at anyone who disses this song. (i'll buy as many as it takes.)

**static\_int\_husp** (8): kitschy, but cute

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e39SR4YvCw

**1998tweety** (7.9): This is cute, her voice sounds different on the song and I'm not sure if I prefer it or not.

**christopher\_aia** (7): the low-key happy vibe she mastered on the Golden Hour started here

**dramiaa** (7): cute and corny, just like me. yeehaw.

**itsnotrelevantt** (7): it's cute

**qetaz** (7): A cute bop, but it doesn‚Äôt really grab me.

**skargardin** (7): Solid Kacey bop but nothing that special

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): flo rida shaking

**MissyBee37** (6.5): I am no fan of harmonica (right? that sounds like a harmonica but the song credits are making me think it's an accordion?? I don't know.), but I do like Kacey's trademark witty, fun lyrics here. I have to laugh out loud at "hitch your wagon to the living room I'm draggin" lol. This is not one of my favorites but it is fun.

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.1): this is super traditional in sound and a bit funny lyrically, with not much to hate but not much to love either. i have a pavlovian response to harmonicas and the way she says buffalo.

**vayyiqra** (6): This is a little more upbeat but I don't love it. It's the kind of country I don't like.

**HerculesMeow** (5): This song just takes the country fantasy a little too far for me

This was honestly never a standout track to me. I liked the song, but never LOVED it ya feel? Well, that changed when she sang it at the Grammys with Alicia Keys. I had actual goosebumps. After that I was OBSESSED. I listened to it a LOT for a LONG time. "Still seeing signs of you / Things that you wanted me to read, shit you wanted me to do" is way to real. Break ups aren't a one day thing, it lasts ages. Going to that restaurant that makes you think of them, hearing their favourite song on the radio, etc. Her belting the chorus at 3:15 is honestly peak vocals. Maren wrote this song after seeing her ex-boyfriends mother in LA, and how wild she found it. Some songs I've written a funny story to go along with it, some I just wrote about how it bangs and moves on, but I really just can't emphasize enough how beautiful this song is. Thank You.

---
**rickikardashian** (11): This song made me stan this whole album. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt get through the night, so we had to call it a day‚Äù is a brilliant lyrics and the entire chorus gets better every time I listen to it. Marren really is That Bitch ‚Ñ¢. Yeehaw.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this ballad is absolutely showstopping. maren's vocals are completely on point, and i love love LOVE the organ. this isn't my most played song in the rate but it takes me places on every single listen so it deserves my 11!

**ExtraEater** (10): when i listen to this, i always imagine this: i'm in a big mansion, in a spacious bedroom, white marble walls and floor, i'm on one of those big, fancy beds, there's water on the floor (like those places at the water park where the ground is flowing, toe-level water), and i'm on the bed just lying down really tired and enjoying the high class relaxation life at the end of a stressful day. female counterpart to 'all around you' by sturgill simpson. this is a really damn good song

**gannade** (10): UGHHHHHHH Maren‚Äôs MIND

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): once just absolutely rips at my heart every time. there‚Äôs not much else to say.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): that grammy performance with Alicia Keys was some GOOD SHIT

**teresan527** (10): Honestly I don‚Äôt know what to say haha. This song speaks for itself. Actually one thing, the lack of bridge kinda irks me because it would just kick this song up to whole other level. But this song is amazing so I‚Äôm gonna give it a pass.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.5): invented singular mathematical operations

**twat\_brained** (9.2): This is probably me tired laying in bed having had wine but I am absolutely feeling Maren's voice here and the guitars. Such a strong and powerful ballad which I really hope Maren belts out live on tour

**dramiaa** (9): A beautiful ballad. Her voice is amazing

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): some**HOW**

**1998tweety** (8.7): Her voice is doing the same thing as it did on Second Wind, it sounds too much like Zara.

**Leixander** (8.5): yas scream maren

**shineflyer** (8.5): what is that one instrument? a synth? i'm talkin about that little "bwo-wo-wah" riff. i love it. the rest of the song's pretty damn good, too. this song must be killer live

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): A little less exciting than others, but I like the chorus. Also that one sound.

**therokinrolla** (8.3): maren the vocalist

**christopher\_aia** (8): good ballad but has less personality than her other songs

**letsallpoo** (8): dont FORGETTTT...that /u/mudkip1 loved me once........

**poppinmmolly** (8): grown on me but still my least fave on the album tbh.

**qetaz** (8): This is really great, the production, the way it builds up, Maren‚Äôs amazing voice.

**vayyiqra** (8): That organ gets me every time. I have no idea why, but it really adds to these songs. This album really benefitted from a nice ballad.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Twice! We love a torch song.

**jamesfog** (7): Kinda overrated @NapsAndNetflix @TragicKingdom1

**tapdancingpig** (7): I like the 6/8 feel of the song, and Maren sounds great, but it feels kind of hookless and meandering.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): 1Ô∏è‚É£

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): my favourite song on the album, i think. i just love the woahs and the line preceding them, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt know your heart from a hole in the ground‚Äô. and i LOVE her for flipping the narrative and just fucking going for it. ‚Äòlove is stupid‚Äô. yeah, bitch, it is!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): @me Miss Kacey

**piccprincess** (10): YEE STUPID EE BITCH EE ENERGY HAW

**therandomsinger13** (10): Ooh yes that beat. This is solid.

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Great energy. I love the music, the melody, her vocal and the whoa's. The lyrics are a little more straight-forward than some of Kacey's more clever songs but still fun & full of attitude.

**christopher\_aia** (9): damn I never liked this song when this album came out but this SLAPS

**tapdancingpig** (9): Probably the most overtly fun song on the record as of now, with the most obvious hook. The four note melody sticks itself in your head.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): a shot of energy

**1998tweety** (8.7): This sounds like the type of song that would benefit from a rock remix.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): facts are facts, 90% of my stress comes from me randomly remembering things I did back when I was in love that I cringe about now and the other 10% is me stressing out about dying alone

**jamesfog** (8): A cute short bop

**qetaz** (8): This bops. Another great country/rock fusion, and while I think that Blowin‚Äô Smoke is stronger lyrically, I prefer the melody and production here.

**Shippy29** (8): omg kacey go off on this bitch?? fuck this stupid hoe yeah u go glen coco

**twat\_brained** (7): https://www.amazon.com/Im-Stupid-Funny-T-Shirt/dp/B01C1QU28U

**vayyiqra** (6): I couldn't help but think "this song is a little stupid". :/

**ExtraEater** (5): good title

**lalodragon** (5): this is maybe my least favorite Kacey song because it gets loud and repetitive, in an obnoxious way. The songwriting is still great, though.

**Leixander** (5): kinda bopping but her vocals are kinda off oop, also a huge outlier in the album

The single that never was. Everything about this song screams radio hit, but alas here we are with it considered a deep cut. Sugar starts the album off with a bang, with the exploding chorus in a song telling us Maren has a crush on this guy. Some of you had an issue with the Coca-Cola line. Coke is lowkey quintessential Christmas, whether you realize it or not. Their sales go up around Christmas every year, and it's due to their lit marketing. The coke commercials around the holidays are so wholesome, and make you feel warm and fuzzy. Marens saying she craves him like people crave coke at christmas, because I don't go out and seek Coke on christmas, but it is their popular time of the year so SOME people crave a coke on Christmas heavily due to just marketing. Also lets be real, I think I have had coke on Christmas day the past few years. The only difference is it usually has some rum in it, but it still proves her point. So, who looks like a fool now @ people who complained about the line. Anyways, the song's lit and this has been holiday marketing class with Naps.

**jamesfog** (10): YAS! SUGAR SUGAR OHHOOHHH! A BOP!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented Coca-Cola

**therokinrolla** (10): Wow can you believe this opening riff outsold anything St Vincent has ever done? Can you believe this is more iconic than that iconic riff on Sweet Child O Mine? I can. Sugar is such a fitting name considering how SWEET that hook is.

**shineflyer** (9.5): the first five seconds of this song are better than anything on kelsea's album

**1998tweety** (9): A big bop and nice opener.

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): so i grew up with country (especially outlaw country and the dixie chicks) but fell out of love with it when i was older and started exploring other genres and noticed all the damn problems i have with (mostly male) country. i stopped listening to most new releases and stuck to my pop country staples and the southern gothic murder-y subset of country. but this last spring, after /u/poppinmmolly put craving you in the charity rate and niall horan put maren on his debut album, i found myself wanting to listen to more of what she had to offer (the yeahhhh she does in craving you is better than any word thomas rhett has sung in his entire career) and listened to hero front to back and back to front when i was cooking in the evenings and convinced myself i could sing again. sugar is a standout. i‚Äôve deducted a point because the coca cola line is so perplexing, but i love the song so much otherwise! she‚Äôs just got this sass to her i love so much, it reminds me of the women i grew up adoring.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): maroon 5 found dead

**therandomsinger13** (9): Love the metaphor

**dramiaa** (8.5): I could be ur sugar any day, Maren. Dm me

**rockysaytalk** (8.5): Would have been higher if it wasn't for that Coca Cola line

**christopher\_aia** (8): good intro to Maren's style

**ExtraEater** (8): rush

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I think that there‚Äôs a bit of a disconnect between those wonderfully sultry verses and that kind of generic pop-county chorus though, and it disappoints me because I love the vibe of the verses and wish she‚Äôd just held on to that.

**lalodragon** (8): Maren is very good at taking a single idea and expanding on it, adding details, delivering it at top volume for an A+ pop song

**qetaz** (8): I love the verses particularly. Her voice sounds great! This makes me excited for the rest of her album.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Wow. I heard that she was a pop girl in hiding, but... she‚Äôs a pop girl in hiding. This song is pure pop with enough guitars to fool the commonfolk.

**teresan527** (8): Sweetener is quaking. (sorry I had to)

**TragicKingdom1** (8): idk why but this is just the definition of an 8. if it doesn't have an exactly 8 average and a 0 controversy score i will be upset

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Oh man, loose guitar strings are such a guilty pleasure for me. Last weekend, however, my sister was concerned that I was having too much sugar and I might become a type 1 diabetic. So I'm afraid I can't be your sugar, Maren.

**Leixander** (7.5): t-a-s-t-e-y

**martymcflurry** (7): a fun song! is coca cola on christmas day a thing?

**piccprincess** (7): Sweet Yeehaw

**Shippy29** (7): oh i got excited by the production when i heard it after the abysmal kelsea album but it got kinda basic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): üç¨

**vayyiqra** (7): The lead track on this album is unexpectedly a little edgy. Ariana is shook, queen of monosaccharides.

MrSwearword: In a 5:1:4 outcome, Kacey Musgraves owns half of the Top 10 but narrowly loses Day 2 considering she lost 5 songs to Maren's 4. However, this Day 2 chopping is the most even considering all 3 artists lost half of their remaining songs.
