New Country Girls Rate Reveal Day 1: Different Genre, Same Flops
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9htivm/new_country_girls_rate_reveal_day_1_different/

Hey everyone,

welcome to the long awaited country girls rate! Although /u/the_chainsmokers didn't do the rate, I can only assume they started it and heard how good Kelsea was and went to collab with her instantly and forgot to do the rest. I can't be mad about that, [stream This Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuPzpoC3QNc).

* The rate will start in one hour at **5pm EST**

* We will be going from **#38-#21** today

* **54** people did this rate. You can see who [here](https://pastebin.com/wpXHkCak)

* The average score is **7.7706**

* The average controversy score is **1.4997**. Anything above that should be considered controversial.

The lack of comments on this song honestly makes me scream, because I'm sitting here trying to figure out what to say about it and I have no idea. This song is just sort of there, and while the metaphor is neat, there's not much to be said about this song. It's not surprising this is in last place. I do think the lyrics are fine, and if we had a ~~better~~ different person sing it, with better production this could be really good. Also in about 3 songs on this album Kelsea says things along the lines of "you with your new blonde" and like what is that about? It's such an odd thing to consistently bring up.

---
**1998tweety** (10): The guitar bit at the beginning sounded so much like Innocent I was so confused. The “I wear my pain like stilettos” bit reminds me of Wrecking Ball too.

**jamesfog** (9): Oh wow, loves this chorus!

**therandomsinger13** (9): Some of this instrumental sounds like Innocent by Taylor. No one wonder she likes this. I like title line.

**piccprincess** (8): Really High Yeehaw

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I like the lyrics, but this just seems like a generic ballad (and I love a good ballad).

**christopher\_aia** (7): cool metaphor

**rickikardashian** (7): Blonde girls get real offended when their exes date another blonde

**vayyiqra** (7): This is kind of a weird metaphor and I'm not the target audience for this but it's good at what it does.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Steve Madden is shaking

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): the metaphor is cute but that's kind of it

**qetaz** (5): “I wear my pain like stilettos”?? What is that even meant to mean?

**shineflyer** (5): just don't wear the shoes. throw em out. they can't look THAT good

**twat\_brained** (5): The only dead horse more beaten than the Four Chords of Pop is the first chord being E major. Wearing stilettos are already painful so what's the point in enduring even more pain just to show you're in pain?

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.3): a song with stilettos as the title has to be good. and honestly, this really isn’t. i don’t know how kelsea did it but she’s managed to make an album that exemplifies both what i love and really fucking hate about country. that takes work, so, cheers, kels.

**lalodragon** (4): Oh honey, you know you can just wear flats? Or even sneakers?

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Here’s where the album really takes a nosedive in quality. This is definitely like, the worst song in the rate, and I say that as a Kelsea stan. Musically this song is so dead and cliche, it’s not interesting or memorable at all. The lyrics feel kind of phoned in and they don’t really work. Kelsea also gives like… an uncharacteristically bad vocal performance here? Like, she sounds sick or something, and the weird meandering melody of the song doesn’t do her any favors.

Ok so obviously you guys don't like this song, but it's a lot of fun. It actually does bring me back to high school, where you're just chilling with friends everyday and just living life. Also I never used a fake I.D., but a couple friends would use my brothers for the bar occasionally and the one idiot lost it and I felt really bad and I didn't ask him after that if friends could use it again because they lost that privilege. Except who the fuck was drinking wine underaged as their drink of choice? Imagine some girl going to the a house party at 17 years old and bringing a bottle of wine to drink? Nah man, it was always like Malibu or raspberry vodka for like 95% of girls I know. Maybe the white in me is jumping out, but this bitch went to a party with wine? What are you going to play beer pong with Kelsea? Apart from this GLARING flaw in the song, it's overall pretty good and a nice album closer.

---
**ManofOranges** (10): This is just another bop. The lyrics are also like really strong for this one. Kelsey really makes me feel like I can relate to living carelessly as a child even though I really can't.

**ExtraEater** (9): good title good piano line

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): she really has a line that says "r kelly on the radio" in a song called "underage" omgggggg

**therandomsinger13** (9): Umm did she just mention R. Kelly on a song called Underage? I do like this. Don't grow up too fast, kids!

**1998tweety** (8.6): I already know y'all are sending this out first cause she name dropped R.Kelly

**twat\_brained** (8.3): "R. Kelly on the radio"😬😬😬🙅🏼‍♂️🙅🏼‍♂️sadly this is a lovely closer but I can't in good conscience give this a 10 because of that lyric

**christopher\_aia** (8): surprisingly good but TBH I'm kind of tired of the album

**jamesfog** (8): A cute closer.mp3

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): me hooking up with ppl older than me

**therokinrolla** (8): the words scariest song title and also I could ping someone but

**rickikardashian** (7.8): \*6ix9ine joined the chat*

**MissyBee37** (7.5): This is a cute song & a good close to an album. It's a fun snapshot of how that time in your life feels. It's a touch cliche but I like the nods to how it's the same for every generation. It's a little nostalgic but not too much; it's a little critical but only gently so, which is fitting; it's not apologizing for having fun, either. Just a nice little snapshot. I like it. (But, girl, why R. Kelly?? Wasn't somebody better on the radio??)

**piccprincess** (7): Underaged Yeehaw

**poppinmmolly** (7): R. Kelly yikes

**qetaz** (7): picking up a bit to close out the album.

**vayyiqra** (7): This gives me a strong "This Is What Makes Us Girls" vibe. As with most of the lyrics on these albums, I can't really relate to them personally but I understand the appeal.

**lalodragon** (6): Buy Smokin’ and Drinkin’ by Miranda Lambert on iTunes

**martymcflurry** (6): some of us were nerds in high school kelsea

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): 6ix9ine is shaking

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This song is kind of a letdown as the closer of the album. I think one of the reasons I’m so fond of this album (and especially *Unapologetically*) is because I really relate to the themes of youth and love because I’ve been young and dumb and in love with boys not really worth my time but I thought they were, but I was also very straight laced and never snuck out or anything like that. I also kind of can’t remember what this song sounds like, it’s not bad but it’s just unmemorable. Also the R. Kelly reference was already dated but it’s just aged more and more poorly.

**tapdancingpig** (5): This is a meh song, but a bad closing track. An album closer should connect to the rest of the album, or resolve some themes of the album, or at least be good. This sneaks in with a weak “by the way, don’t be dumbasses kids” theme that was never brought up in the rest of the album.

**shineflyer** (4.5): not looking forward to people tryin to make jokes with this one

**ImADudeDuh** (4): wasn't there some popheads user who talked about how they had a crush on a 14 year old student of theirs?

**Leixander** (4): nice instrumentals wasted on a song like this

**Shippy29** (3): LMAO this is so disappointing for the closing song wtf

**gowestyoungkanye** (2): uh the title was a fucking yikes, and the r kelly mention? yall. yall. i just can’t get over how fucking corny and stupid this is. like i love girls and i love songs like this that call upon girlhood and shared experiences under most other circumstances but fuck, the chorus is so fucking bad.

This emotional ballad is lyrically really strong, about Kelsea waiting for an ex to pick her up for a date and not showing. Lines like "Even when you don't have me/You can still be the one to hurt me" are so simple, yet so effective. I'm super likeable and good looking, so I've personally never had someone not show for a date like this - yet I feel like I'm right there with Kelsea on her porch waiting for him to show. The imagery at the beginning with her heart racing is too painfully relatable. We've all been in the position where we're waiting for someone to pick us up and we awkwardly putter around the house and occasionally look outside just waiting. For real though, how embarrassing must it be waiting for a date to show and not showing up? I can't even imagine omg the more I think about it the more I full body cringe. Also does anyone remember that scene in Dumb and Dumber where the girl tells Jim Carrey she'll meet him for a drink at 8, so he shows up at the bar at 8am and sits there like an idiot. Then after a while he asks the bartender the time and he says it's 10am and Jim Carrey says "oh, she must be running late". I think about that scene a lot. Anyways, this song's good.

---
**therokinrolla** (9.5): wow can you believe that this subtle album track is her best song? I can, because of her above average lyricism and suiting production on it. Her mind is astonishing.

**therandomsinger13** (9.2): I love the storytelling

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is one of those songs where I wish that Kelsea had leaned a bit more into the “country” part of “country-pop” because I think that this song would play better if the production were scaled back a bit. It almost overwhelms itself at times and it’s a pity because the rest of this song is more or less perfect.

**1998tweety** (8.8): This sounds so much like a Taylor song, I like it.

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): relatable :(

**twat\_brained** (8.1): This definitely feels like one of the poppier songs. Just wish it had a higher bpm or something just to make it feel less like musical melatonin. Then again me having a mild cold isn't helping much either

**ExtraEater** (8): that's why goodbye 😢 💔 should mean goodbye 😔 👋

**teresan527** (8): I love the storyline of this song. It’s heartbreaking and heart wrenching. I love her interpretation of “the first time”. I’m so glad this isn’t another one of those “making love for the first time and it was magical blah blah blah”. I like that she took the phrase that is usually associated with positive feelings, turn it on its head and put on negative connotation on it.

**tapdancingpig** (7.8): Stopping a line mid sentence do that you can make the title line stand out is, somewhat irrationally, one of my least favorite music tropes, but this song earns my respect with its lyrics.

**jamesfog** (7): A pretty basic country ballop

**MissyBee37** (7): There are some lyric gems that keep this from being just another he-broke-my-heart-again song. I like her writing on lines like, "Even when you don't have me/You can still be the one to hurt me." I also like the contrast that, by the title, I was expecting a first-love type of song but it's exactly the opposite.

**piccprincess** (7): The First Yeehaw

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm getting some Style vibes from this.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): idk why but this ballad doesn't really quite work for me

**christopher\_aia** (6): meh, this is really generic and not my thing, it's good background music but nothing more

**ImADudeDuh** (6): you name your album after this song?

**Leixander** (6): really low key to be the title of an album

**shineflyer** (6): it's okay honey, you can do better. i believe in you

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Taylor Swift is shaking

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): for the title song this is underwhelming

**itsnotrelevantt** (5): Boring until the last minute

**qetaz** (5): A fairly standard heartbreak ballad. I’d never go back to this because it’s been done better so many times (See: Taylor Swift). But it does have a few moments that rise above the rest, like the lyric “I bet you’re out drinking with a new blonde/and telling her whatever’s playing is her song”.

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): sounds like a red reject, so you know what, i’ll say it, taylor swift done fucked up pop country

**lalodragon** (4): There's an almost bottomless supply of country songs about exes. You can do better.

**Shippy29** (3): i was bored to tears honestly

Ok, so everyone has that one white girl on Facebook who still actually uses Facebook and will post about how she wants to lay in the back of a truck bed and watch the stars. If you don't know what I mean, I literally just googled "truck bed stars" and got about 500 examples like [this](https://imgur.com/93gN3fM) of things they post. If you're a basic who does that, I'm so sorry but your friends should have been making fun of you for this already. While the idea is corny, Kelsea truly does have a point here. I don't know if you've all just laid and watched the stars, but it's a fucking lit night, man. Literally and figuratively. There is nothing nicer than laying out on a nice summer nice and watching the stars, see a shooting star every now and then, if you're lucky the northern lights. Just you and friends laying there, talking, and watching the world go bye. It's truly one of the most relaxing things you can do and genuinely will bring you closer to people. The production here is a little shoddy, but lyrically Kelsea has made some points. Driving down and watching the stars with a significant other is one of the genuinely nicest things you can do, and while you guys apparently didn't like this song, I think there's something magical and simple about what she's talking about.

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is a song that in theory is kind of generic but like, at the same time, I adore. It’s actually low key one of my favorite songs in the whole rate (it would have been my 11 if another song hadn’t snatched) it really brings out my inner country hoe.  Her vocals really sell the song, she sounds so excited to lie on the bed of a truck with this guy. But I think the thing that sells it for me is how the quiet first verse gets quiet for a second right before she explodes into the chorus. It really effectively paints the image of her waiting with anticipation for him to arrive, then him pulling up in his truck when the chorus hits. Then the rest of the song is a bit louder but pulls back into quieter strings whenever she sings about waiting for him to show up, until she reaches that pulled back bridge… she plays out the whole scene of this truck ride for us musically, she really takes us there.

**jamesfog** (9): A country radio bop

**ManofOranges** (9): Whew a bop.

**1998tweety** (8.9): This started as a chill bop and then evolved into a full on jam.

**rickikardashian** (8.8): country I Know Places

**twat\_brained** (8.7): If you say "only the truck and the trees" will see what you do then… oh my God. Paris Hilton is right. The stars really are blind

**ExtraEater** (8.5): really good title

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I found this to be way more charming than I probably should have.

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): Kinda feels like a more modern version of TS's Tim McGraw or Mary's Song.

**poppinmmolly** (8): CUTE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): John Green is shaking

**vayyiqra** (8): This idea has been done before by other songs, but it's cute and I never get tired of it. (Stream Black Sky by Kimbra on Spotify.)

**itsnotrelevantt** (7.5): I like the chorus a lot but the rest is snore town

**piccprincess** (7.5): Yeehawing at Stars

**christopher\_aia** (7): good but didn't impact me a ton

**skargardin** (7): This album is becoming a tad bit predictable by now even tho the songs are pretty good.

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.7): sounds like something off the soundtrack for a horse girl movie

**Leixander** (5.5): i am bored

**shineflyer** (5.5): i feel like the song's more upbeat than it needs to be. stars are mellower than the punch the chorus has, after all

**lalodragon** (5): paint by the numbers country filler part 2

**qetaz** (5): I’m running out of ways to call a song totally unremarkable.

**Shippy29** (5): nnnnn im very sorry naps but this is the girl with so much hype? im so bored...

**teresan527** (5): It’s alright. Nothing really special. Feels like a filler track.

This is by no means a perfect song. That being said, the line "We can start like the touch of a hand like a movie scene / moving into the weight that you've been wanting to put on me" is magical. Even if you've never experienced it, you can perfectly visualize it and you *know* the feeling. It's the feeling Taylor's Wildest Dream music video tries to encapture - a bunch of white people in Africa. For real though, I just picture the old timey movie aesthetic on that line, and you can just feel the sparks fly. This was another Taylor joke please laugh.

---
**gannade** (10): my FAV filler in this entire rate. UGHHHH!!! This is just so easy going and carefree and warm and cozy

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented DIY tutorials

**poppinmmolly** (9): I adore this song

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i really love the clicking noises in the production and i think this is lowkey one of the catchiest songs on the album

**therokinrolla** (8.8): lets cut to the fuckin chase if you don’t cry listening to this beautifully romantic song then honestly you might just be an emotionless robot so goodbye

**1998tweety** (8.7): This song is so weird it sounds like it could've easily had a trap beat on it.

**ExtraEater** (8.5): gives me a nice tired feeling

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): who can relate, woo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): 🔧

**perfumevee** (7.5): Not very memorable when you compare it to the first half of the album.

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.2): a really simplistic, tried-and-true trope heavy song, but it’s also really competent. maybe i just love everything maren does, but i’m not too bothered by this one. maybe it’s because her voice is so full-bodied and has so much character.

**christopher\_aia** (7): least country song on the album but still good

**ImADudeDuh** (7): why is there a weird jungle sound effect on this song? the one that sounds like a parrot going "whala"

**martymcflurry** (7): a kind of sexy yeehaw

**piccprincess** (7): Show off Yeehaw

**vayyiqra** (7): The organ adds a lot to this to be honest. Otherwise it's nothing special.

**shineflyer** (6.5): the verse has a really interesting instrumental, very creative choice for a country album

**twat\_brained** (6.1): This is still the country rate, right? Also, is this about Maren leading someone through their first sexual encounter? Took me long enough to realize

**qetaz** (6): Lyrics a bit under par for Maren. It’s smooth though, and her voice is great as always.

**Shippy29** (6): maren kind of on a downward slope

**skargardin** (6): Meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Something is… off about the bridge of this song? I feel like I’ve heard it before, I’m not sure where but it sounds incredibly familiar. On the whole I wouldn’t say that this song is bad but the album has been so strong up to this point it’s a bit of a letdown, it’s the most “wall of noise” song on the album.

**Leixander** (5): is that psuedo-rap im

**tapdancingpig** (5): The first song that has made no impression on me. The production is nice, I guess?

**lalodragon** (4): I just… don’t like it… the lyrics aren’t as sonically cohesive / metered as her other songs, it’s not a bop or a ballad, it’s forgettable

I'll be honest, I was shocked when this got an 11. The song describes just being yourself and not letting anyone tell you who to be. It's a cute little song, with an anthemic pre-chorus that kind of slightly fizzles out when the chorus actually hits in my opinion. Kelsea wrote this with Josh Osborne, who is a super big songwriter in country music, but related to this rate helped pen 5 songs on Same Trailer, Different Park - including Merry Go 'Round. Obviously, that song did better than this one.

---
**christopher\_aia** (10): wow this is amazing why was this not a single, it's like a female Sam Hunt song but better

**ExtraEater** (9): square vocals into square chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): It loses a point for a lack of specificity, “Follow Your Arrow” kind of shows this one up, but still this song is just pure fun. Kelsea also pulls out a little bit of rap which I’ve always thought was a bit odd but it’s actually a very nice fit. It’s a ton of fun to sing along to!

**jamesfog** (9): A cute bop

**poppinmmolly** (9): cute!

**therandomsinger13** (9): Does this intro say 'la da da da dab dab dab"? Anyway I like the subject matter of this and usually don't like these types of songs that much for some reason. Made me dance.

**1998tweety** (8.9): A nice song with a nice message.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Sometimes, you just gotta call a song a catchy bop and leave it at that.

**twat\_brained** (8): Does she mean like pegs on a stool?

**martymcflurry** (7): a wholesome yeehaw song about being your weird self

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): what are square pegs

**MissyBee37** (7): Square pegs is a simple but effective way to quickly illustrate what she's saying. Pleasant, catchy little song.

**perfumevee** (7): I like the message of this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Sarah Jessica Parker is shaking

**vayyiqra** (7): Tbh I'm not that into pegging but I like this. It's basically the same idea as Follow Your Arrow but is unfortunately going to be destroyed by that song because of all the biased Kacey stans.

**piccprincess** (6.5): Square Yeehaws

**rickikardashian** (6.4): No one told me Alessia Cara was now making country music!

**Leixander** (6): looks like i am not going to like this album oop

**qetaz** (5): Just a standard, cliché motivational song. Kacey did it better. I do like the lyric “square pegs make the world go round” though.

**shineflyer** (3): cheery... too cheery... i don't trust it. are you safe kelsea? blink twice if you need help

**lalodragon** (2): This song wanted to be Follow Your Arrow but without the gay weed why even bother?

Dibs was the second single off of The First Time. It's just a cute, playful song about wanting to be with a boy. There's nothing deep or heavy about this song, it's just a fun song that accomplishes what it set out to do: make you sing along when you hear it on the radio. The "ayyy's" and "ohhhh's" in the chorus, reminiscent of a Nelly track, make it obvious why this went #1 on country airplay. It's the perfect summer song to just cruise around and belt.

---
**christopher\_aia** (10): BOP ALERT

**ExtraEater** (10): any way she says 'dibs' is perfect

**poppinmmolly** (10): her dog is named Dibs and he's adorable

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of rhyming market with mark it

**1998tweety** (9.2): I love the spoken post-chorus bit, she sounds a bit like Ke$ha and it's great.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Nestle Crunch Dibs are shaking

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): She basically has this exact same song like, four times on this album, and I bop to it each time. This is probably the most honky-tonk song on the album.

**piccprincess** (8.5): Dibbles Yeehaw

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): Does anyone say dibs anymore? Not into the spoken part after the chorus. It's a fun song, though.

**shineflyer** (8): i feel like some people might hate the spoken parts, but i think they're cute idk

**Shippy29** (8): omg this was a boppie i love the talking part

**therokinrolla** (8): a good dairy-based dessert

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i call dibs on /u/dropthehammer11

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Charming, but also she seems uncomfortable with almost Kesha like chorus outro (“on you lips” etc).

**HerculesMeow** (7): The very beginning of this song definitely samples some popular Christian Gospel song, but for the life of me I can't remember what it is

**itsnotrelevantt** (7): I wouldn’t let anyone hear me listening to this but it’s cute AYY!

**jamesfog** (7): lmao

**letsallpoo** (7): yeah im callin dibs...on /u/mudkip1's lips...on his kiss...on his dick

**vayyiqra** (7): Alright this album is fairly good but nothing here has jumped out at me for a while. I admit I'm losing interest but I want to finish the rate.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): lyrically not good

**rickikardashian** (6.4): The song was going so good until the “boy I’m calling dibs, on your lips…”.

**lalodragon** (6): Weird location for this song in the album. Come to think of it, the album is ordered strangely overall. Songs about breakups, songs about really being in love, songs about youth, all just kind of shotgunned without respect to overall cohesion.

**qetaz** (6): It’s catchy, and I realise that it’s probably not meant to be taken really seriously, but it comes off as really immature to me.

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): flirty, perfectly adequate, i don’t have much to say about dibs.

**ManofOranges** (5): The fact that this follows secondhand smoke is kind of a crime.

**teresan527** (5): This song is kinda cheesy, a little bit cliché but it’s still fun.

**twat\_brained** (4.1): I won't exactly call dibs on relistens of this

So lyrically, I don't love the chorus. However, I do fucking love the space references in the verses. "Everyone watched as you took the stars right out of my sky / The light out of my eyes" to end on her saying she needs space from the guy. Also do y'all know those people that are like "SpAcE iS sO fUcKiNg CoOl Im SuCh A nErD" and it's like bitch space is p cool we just don't all need to announce it. It's a good thing Maren released this song, cause word on the street is [Grimes is going to release this about Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcYppAs6ZdI)

**piccprincess** (10): Astronaut Yeehaw

**shineflyer** (10): a swaying song, a great banjo part. feels just as whimsical as it should. i feel very calmed, thank you for curing my anxiety, maren

**teresan527** (10): Honestly, this song gives me some Taylor Swift vibes haha. I approached this album expecting to love 80s Mercedes and/or Once the most because those are the ones people have been hyping but I fell in love with this song. Lyrically, it’s not out of this world (hehe) but melodically it’s interesting and so soothing. I just want to tuck myself in bed and listen to this on repeat every night.

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.5): kacey in 2018 is shook! (literally everyone is going to comment on this, naps, so i’m sorry i fed into it)

**therandomsinger13** (9.5): Combination of Space Cowboy by Kacey, Innocent by Taylor, and Spaceship by Kesha. I love all those songs, so this is great.

**dramiaa** (9): Beautiful way to end an amazing album

**1998tweety** (8.9): Kesha's spaceship is quaking.

**Leixander** (8.5): space cowboy hm, kacey who

**Shippy29** (8.5): this is a MUCH MUCH MUCH better album closer than what kelsea had. i am surprisngly very impressed wth this album

**christopher\_aia** (8): Space Cowboy 1.0

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Kind of a mellow album closer, but I kind of wish that it were mellow? I don’t feel like we really got any genuinely soft, quiet moments from Maren on this album and I think that’s what she’s going for here but there’s too much grit to her vocals for her to really pull it off. She kind of gets it at the end there but it’s a little too late by that point. Still, I’m a slut for space imagery.

**qetaz** (7): A great way to close the rate and her album. I’m glad that we have a couple of songs with lighter floaty vocals as well, Maren really has textural range in her voice.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): 💫

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): space cowboy is shaking

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a good closer and I like it enough that I can overlook how much I hate banjo as an instrument. It doesn't blow my mind (mwah) but it's nice.

**hikkaru** (6.5): Kesha's Spaceship outspacerelatedcountryoutroballaded

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): Pleasant but unmemorable way to end an album.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): invented light years, Kylie Minogue is shook

**twat\_brained** (5.8): Feels a bit too subdued for an album closer. Not to mention ending the album like this makes it seem like you need time away from recording and the music world as a whole, like you're not excited about everything. It makes it seem like you're not hungry to make more music, to excite your fans. I don't see it as reflecting well on Maren's part.

**itsnotrelevantt** (5): I’m a ballad hater sue me

Ok well, I think a lot of you missed the metaphor here. Maren isn't actually smoking. She's using the term "bummin' cigarettes" to say she's going home with the wrong guys. "Just admit, when I'm with him, I still feel alone" tells us this. To be honest I never really got that until doing this write up and that's what someone commented on genius, but it makes sense and I am sticking with it. Anyways please listen to this song again with that in mind thank you.

**therandomsinger13** (9.8): “I need to get more sleep.” “SAME!” “I’ve been staying up all night.” “SAME!”

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): don’t smoke kids don’t get lung cancer. that being said, this song’s instrumental reminds me a lot of one of my unironic favourite albums, the bryan adams spirit stallion of the cimarron soundtrack.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): maybe dont smoke then

**1998tweety** (8.9): A cute ballad.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.5): is it just me or does maren sound different here? invented the chainsmokers

**lalodragon** (8): this is the one bonus song I really live for

**Shippy29** (8): originally i gave this a 5 but i listened again and tbh its really good thats pretty much all i have to say

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i have never been able to find what i'm talking about but i SWEAR there's a mario kart track with whistling similar to the riff in this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): One of my favorite things about the women of country is that they really understand what it’s like to be constantly disappointed by men.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): somehow, the phrase “I gotta quit bummin’ cigarettes from the wrong guys” is the most country thing I have ever heard

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): A lot of the album has been Maren belting as high as she can, so this is a nice switch up. The lyrics are nice, too.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): You gotta quit bumming cigarettes, period. Like, really, there's no way you're unaware of the repercussions that smoking has on your internal organs, right? If anything, bum a vape pen or something. Or a Hubba Bubba cube if you really need to fixate orally.

**christopher\_aia** (7): meh

**ExtraEater** (7): cool title

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): 🚬

**vayyiqra** (7): Are songs about smoking tobacco a thing in the country genre or is it just this rate? I really don't understand country music culture. :/ Anyway I didn't like it on my first listen but after revisiting it I bumped up its score a bit.

**piccprincess** (6.5): Cigarette Yeehaws

**qetaz** (6): It’s all nice enough, but not a standout for me.

**shineflyer** (5.5): i have trouble remembering this one tbh

**MissyBee37** (5): This song actually reminds me of Kacey's songwriting, which I love... and yet, I don't really care for this song. I can't put my finger on what makes me connect with Kacey and what leaves me indifferent about most of Maren. But this came the closest to me thinking, "Huh, if Kacey had recorded this, I wonder how I'd feel about it..." As is, it's just meh for me.

Ok so just about every comment left here calls this filler, and I can't really argue that. I do really like this song, but compared to the rest of the album it's just kind of... there. Ok, so I watch Wheel of Fortune about 4 times a week and there's a category called "On The Map". Apart from "thing", this is the worst category. I always think it'll be the name of a place, like a city or a famous park or something. 95% of the time it's some stupid shit like "deep south" or "long highway" and it's like yeah I guess those are on a map, but can we please be a little more specific please this broad ass shit would never fly in real cartography. Also I took a geography class once and had to draw maps and do a bunch of cartography stuff, and it was kind of really fun but my professors went on strike that semester and I had like a 3 month break of no school mid-semester, and I came back and they just acted like nothing happened and it was like "oh I was not drawing maps in my spare time during the break I'm going to need a refresher here" but it didn't happen and I did poorly in the class and dropped out of university

**teresan527** (10): Kacey put herself on the map. Yes, she did that.

**therandomsinger13** (9.6): Aw Kacey! Give me a hug I’ll help you.

**gannade** (9): i know this is like total filler but its really nice

**lalodragon** (9): mostly I go off about Kacey’s songwriting ability but this song also showcases those pipes imo

**piccprincess** (8.5): Back on the Yeehaw

**1998tweety** (8.2): I feel like this song could've been improved if Kacey belted a bit at the very end.

**vayyiqra** (8): I like this more rock kind of song those drums sound mint. This would be a good album for driving.

**MissyBee37** (7.3): I overlooked this song before, and I think the slow-going nature of the melody is probably part of what turned me off. I probably didn't pay attention to the lyrics before, but they're better than I remembered and so relatable. I know that feeling... The lyrics & sentiment are unique and interesting and vulnerable, even if I don't love the music.

**christopher\_aia** (7): it's like good, but nondescript

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): this is nice. i don’t have anything sassy to say, it’s relatable in its desperation.

**tapdancingpig** (7): The melody sticks with you, but I find this song kind of dull. The lyrics are competent, which is more than what can be said of Maren and Kelsea’s filler tracks, but they’re still boring.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpAPD_2N6Ng

**twat\_brained** (6.6): …wait what was she singing about? I was on Twitter and wasn't paying much attention. I guess that's what happens when most of this rate is just dour, preachy harps on the same tried and true country tropes that have shaped and defined the genre. I knew that's what I was getting into with this rate but I underestimated just how present I have to be

**ExtraEater** (6.5): nice title and love that chorus good work

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This isn’t it for some reason, I can’t quite pin down why but this song isn’t as good as the others. It just seems a bit… sprawling? It never quite finds a core, or the punch that the other songs have.

**martymcflurry** (6): this one drags a little and i think the other ballads on the album are better

**shineflyer** (5.5): it's pleasant but really doesn't stick with you

**qetaz** (5): Again, a bit filler. Not really sure what else to comment on here.

**Shippy29** (5): oh NO KACEY you went full kelsea on this one

This was the final single on the album, and Kelseas first song to not go #1 on country radio. This bubbly song is straight up pop, with a 3 second guitar riff so it counts as country! Honestly, this song is basically just Dibs or Love Me Like You Mean it done over again, there's nothing new here, but it's just a fun song you can bop to on your drive to work. In the music video for this she's serving some LOOKS. It also gave us [this](https://i.imgur.com/bjNXc0P.png) youtube comment which makes me absolutely scream for some reason.

**christopher\_aia** (10): this is another bop

**lalodragon** (10): This is the kinda shit I come to Kelsea for. It is an unencumbered bop.

Anyway, my name's Kondwani, this has been my yeah boy video, bye.

**hikkaru** (7.5): longest yeah boy ever

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): my longest yeah boy ever

**therokinrolla** (7.5): I was told this was supposed to be a great banging single but the hook is a letdown sorry not sorry

**piccprincess** (7): Yeehaw Boy

**static\_int\_husp** (7): repetitive

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I like the chorus of this a lot but the song definitely has its problems. The “time/wine” rhyme is pretty dumb and the song kind of lacks a bridge? It’s also really a retread of “Dibs,” “Love Me Like You Mean It,” and “Stars,” all of which are better. The fact that there’s choreography for the music video is pretty neat I guess.

**HerculesMeow** (6): I'm about to attempt the longest yeah boy ever

The inadvertent title track to Hero. I think you guys did this song dirty, because in my opinion it's brilliant. Maren wants to be with a guy, he wants to be with her, but she KNOWS he can do better than her. The relatable legend she is, Maren saying "hate me if you have to / I hate myself too" is deep, man. My friend and her boyfriend of like 3 years recently broke up in a similar fashion actually. She said they both loved each other, but wanted different things in the future. She wanted kids and a family soon-ish, and he wanted that after he established himself in his career. They broke up knowing the both loved each other still, and she said it was the hardest thing she's ever done because they KNOW they want to be together, but they also KNOW it's not for the best in the end. She kind of told us awkwardly at a bonfire though and it really put a damper on the night because we were laughing and having fun and then next thing you know she's crying, and my friend is crying, and I'm an emotionless robot that's also there and idk. But, if situations like that don't break your fucking heart than I don't know what does. It's basically sonder in a song.

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh wow this is such a vibe. “Hate me if you have to, I hate myself too”

**letsallpoo** (10): IM NOT THE HERO IN THE STORRRYYYYYYYYY. SnatchedT

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented Marvel

**christopher\_aia** (9): I love the dynamic in this song and how it flips normal ones around

**skargardin** (9): WHERE do I know this from?? It’s driving me insane aagh

**perfumevee** (8.5): The guitar reminds me a bit of Bonnie Raitt.

**1998tweety** (8.4): I Wish You Would outsold but this is still nice.

**qetaz** (8): Some of her best vocal moments in this song, and the understated groove of the production really suits.

**Shippy29** (8): this was so NICE omgomg

**therokinrolla** (8): the title track that never was :cry:

**Leixander** (7.7): that second verse feels like it is supposed to be sung by someone else, her voice gets very deep in it

**twat\_brained** (7.6): This is a personal attack omg

**itsnotrelevantt** (7): Sweet but less fun than other songs. Love the instrumental

**piccprincess** (7): I wish I was Yeehawing

**vayyiqra** (6): I feel little to nothing about this but it's okay, I guess.

**lalodragon** (5): This gets really nasal

**MissyBee37** (5): "But almost never hangs on forever" is a strong lyric! The rest is a little forgettable & repetitive to me, but that line really stood out.

**shineflyer** (5): good for when you need to slow things down on the corn field dance floor. (also, shoutout to sounding a tiny bit like I'm Not The Only One)

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.6): oof, if just another thing didn’t sound like indie-singer songwriter in the early 2000s, then this one definitely does. this is a sara bareilles song. i’m not big on it, to be honest. there’s not much i can find to enjoy in it. i do find it funny she chose hero as the title of her album from here when it’s probably the one i like least and completely fails to capture what makes maren so good. it’s soulless.

**tapdancingpig** (3): I like the production here, but I Wish I Was strikes me as exceptionally lazy. The lyrics need revisions, the melody is lacking, and UGH!

Ok, this song is super fucking sad. So it's about a girl who would hear her parents fighting at night when she was in bed, and now that she's older she's scared she's turning into them. She hears herself say phrases they said when fighting, and is worried she'll inherit the same destructive traits as them and honestly yikes. This song speaks for itself better than I ever could, so just listen to it tbh.

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The third member of the “oh wow this girl can really write” trilogy on this album. The way she describes herself choking on the secondhand smoke of her parent’s relationship while also wondering if she, like the smoke, is just another harmful byproduct of their burned marriage… it’s good. Very good.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why is this Bojack Horseman levels of family abuse/depression and like goddamn

**MissyBee37** (10): Wow, this one took me by surprise. It brought tears to my eyes. What a heartbreaking story. I mean it's a story many of us know, but the way she captures it and reflects on how it affects her is poignant. The whole song is a strong metaphor. This must've been painful to write. Kudos to her for being strong enough to reflect on it (both for the song and just for life).

**therandomsinger13** (9.3): I like this being after the intensity of Sirens. Fits perfectly. First prechorus and chorus lyrics are great. Love the strings.

**HerculesMeow** (9): I actually really like this song because it's one of Kelsea's more serious songs, and I find it pretty #relatable so

**1998tweety** (8.6): So many people smoke outside buildings on campus and its so annoying cause they're supposed to stay at least 5 meters away but they don't, so I relate with this song HARD.

**Leixander** (8.5): finally a breath of fresh air

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a much better ballad than the title track, it serves tearful ride home on an empty highway during sunset

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.2): this reminds me a lot of maren’s dear hate and kelsea’s vocal just falls flat in comparison. but, i would feel bad rating it low because it’s clearly so personal and honestly relatable (as far as not wanting to be like your parents, mine are still in love but very much in love). and it’s probably one of the most raw things i’ve ever heard from anyone (for a comparable pop song, try dna by lia marie johnson).

**christopher\_aia** (8): liked this, but I would take out the violins

**jamesfog** (8): Cute

**ManofOranges** (8): Wow.

**piccprincess** (8): Secondhad Yeehaw

**qetaz** (8): This has way more personality than her other songs, and the lyrics are actually quite emotive and clever. This is also the first time I’d say that Kelsea’s voice was really emotive on this album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The cigarette industry is shaking

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): queen of anti-smoking public service announcements!!!

**poppinmmolly** (7.8): I love the lyrics but the music is a little lack luster

**martymcflurry** (7.5): the stronger ballad on the album imo

**Shippy29** (7.5): this was pretty cute

**twat\_brained** (7.2): Me when I get my soulmate to quit smoking

**shineflyer** (7): i feel like it's easy to not notice this song, but it's actually pretty pleasant

**teresan527** (7): This is an example of songs that I love lyrically but I couldn’t get into the melody. The lyrics and the story is so tragic and heartbreaking but I think musically it’s kinda boring.

**itsnotrelevantt** (6): I’m sorry I don’t like uninteresting ballads but it’s not bad I guess

**lalodragon** (6): I like the subject matter + metaphors in the song. It’d be a better song if I wasn’t comparing it to the other two, who are better songwriters. Kelsea tends towards the vague/cliche, conversational, and repetitive—all okay for a pop song, I know, but I’m a poet at heart. This song relies on a lot of clichés (hear a pin drop, rise from the ashes, burning bridges) and they’re used well but they don’t get a real innovative expansion. The main metaphor (don’t want to choke / on that secondhand smoke) is repeated in similar ways without much innovation or expansion—compare that to Rich, in which Maren takes the saying “If I had a dime every time…” and fucking RUNS with it. Or we can talk about how these lyrics are conversational more than they are lyric—read them aloud and they have no real music to them, then read Merry Go Round aloud and notice the tight consistent beat that keeps it memorable (it’s largely iambic). So overall, good impulse behind it but the song could have been executed better. That difference is why I stan the hell out of Maren and Kacey, but kind of ignore Kelsea.

**tapdancingpig** (6): The first song off this album that does nothing for me. It’s just a generic ballad. Plus, the chorus is close enough to “Requiem” from the overwrought and overrated musical Dear Evan Hansen that I kept going “wait, but that’s not how it goes” every so often.

**vayyiqra** (6): I like the instrumental but I don't like the lyrics. Does every country album have to have at least one song about smoking as a metaphor?

It's not a huge surprise this is out already, considering most popheads are losers with no friends. Honestly, the song bangs. It's just out there to remind you what really matters in life. Everyone for their birthday stresses where to go, gotta hit up the right bar or restaurant or whatever. I am super super guilty of this I never know what to do and stress about it. Well, looking back I couldn't tell you where half of my birthdays have been. I couldn't tell you where any of my friends birthdays have been. "And I'm looking at the pictures / The background's only a secondary fixture" sums up this song perfectly. I go out to nicer restaurants a lot with friends because we like to pretend we have money when in fact we're broke. Well, it's always fun but honestly the best times is when we're just drunk losers at mcdonalds at 3am. It doesn't matter where I am, as long as I'm with my buddies I'm having a great time. I honestly love my friends so fucking much, I can get really mushy about it if I wanted I would do anything for them they're too good to me and I just want to hug them they're so nice and funny and djfhgbdfgas well anyways this song describes the love of friendship and it is just really nice

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Points were made.

**ManofOranges** (10): A cute message and it sounds good. What's not to like?

**twat\_brained** (9.3): Okay, this is a pretty cheery one I can get behind! I totally appreciate the message Maren's trying to send; who you are truly comes as a product of your surroundings.

**therandomsinger13** (9.2): Why do I feel like I know this? I do really like this. Also the title gets Modern Day Cain by IDKHOW stuck in my head. Lyrics slaying again on this track. Also lots of interesting sounds.

**1998tweety** (8.7): Another cute wholesome song.

**martymcflurry** (8): "buy you a shot, hold back your hair, take you to waffle house" when will maren be my best friend

Honestly I never really noticed the opening to this is super similar to XO until /u/gannade pointed it out. That being said, this song mega bops. It's basically the love child between Carrie Underwoods Blown Away, and Hunter Hayes Storm Warning. While comparing a relationship to a storm definitely isn't anything new, Kelsea manages to make it her own here. Her making the sound of storm sirens is honestly hilarious, but somehow it's not out-right ridiculous. My only issue is this song *could* have gone off a lot harder, but her mimicking the sirens instantly downplays all the momentum it builds up. The chance for this song to have more edge is right there, and the siren sound just completely neuters that. Also, this is unrelated but every year when there's the big hurricane and they show the footage of the city getting absolutely demolished and the weather person is getting pelted with rain and you can barely hear them over the wind, why do people not leave. Why are people insistent on staying, instead of leaving and being safe? Maybe it's because I've never been in the situation, but you see it and the first chance they tell me to leave town I'm out of there. Why do people stay? Have fun dying I guess. What are you trying to prove?

---
**itsnotrelevantt** (10): The guitar! I keep going back to listen to this one. I switched the score to a 10 because I've listened to it way too much since doing my original rating. Reminds me of the kind of Carrie Underwood-style country girl singing about revenge theme.

**poppinmmolly** (10): honestly 11 worthy. This is such a bop and so fun to sing along to. Try not to have fun while imitating the sirens, it's impossible.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): me during hurricane florence

**therandomsinger13** (10): From the minute this started it sounded bada**. This is a banger. Solid. I feel like Kelsea should start screaming at the end for some reason.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.4): this is promising!! the opening notes, the song title, that barrage of an opening vocal — what did i say about female anger being the best kind of country? i like the fact she doesn’t say sirens in the chorus till the last part, the build up is gorgeous. kelsea, girl, give me more of this and xo, ffs!

**1998tweety** (8.3): I like that this song took a risk by having the weird siren bit, but it kind of ruins the listening experience for me.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): At one point I thought she was trying to imitate a tornado siren in place of saying the actual word "sirens". I'm gonna pretend that's what she was trying to do in the first place for artistic merit.

**christopher\_aia** (8): getting Carrie Underwood Blown Away vibes from this song

**ExtraEater** (8): cool title

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): There’s a song on *Unapologetically* called “Miss Me More” that co-opts this sound, and it’s a little better, but this song is good too. I’m very fond of how during the chorus she plays or sings a siren sound several times instead of actually saying “sirens” because it builds a sense of anticipation, we feel the word “sirens” approaching, portended by actual sirens. It’s pretty neat.

**jamesfog** (8): Sirens by Cher Lloyd outsold

**ManofOranges** (8): I feel like this song will do okay, but it deserves so much better. There's something about it that's just really special and different, I guess? I can't quite put my finger on it but like all those ooooooh's really add to the song and the rock kind of vibe. Ugh it's too good for its own goood.

**MissyBee37** (8): The music itself carries this song for me. The lyrics are kind of what I'd expect for chasing a "bad boy" type but the song itself makes it a fun ride. I love the "oohs" that sound both like a siren & a storm, and the guitar brings a great energy that just sounds like a storm is brewing. I like the melody a lot, too.

**piccprincess** (8): Yeehaws

**tapdancingpig** (8): First of all, actually pouring a melody to the siren was a great choice. Second, these lyrics stick in your brain HARD! I’m shocked this wasn’t a single. Like, this is probably the most traditional country song on the album (and by traditional I mean Carrie Underwood would sing it).

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): cher lloyd is shaking

**martymcflurry** (7): i knew you were trouble's little sister

**qetaz** (7): Catchy, with a bit more attitude than the last few songs

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Nicolas Jaar is shaking

**vayyiqra** (7): I like these lyrics, which are unexpectedly kind of edgy.

**gannade** (6.5): this has the exact same opening as XO but doesnt bop nearly as hard

**Shippy29** (6.5): i quite liked her vocals on it

**Leixander** (5): i already forgot this song to write a comment about it so here it is

**letsallpoo** (5): cher lloyd outsold

**shineflyer** (4): i sure did listen to the oooohhhh.

**lalodragon** (3): it is a song

I'm sitting here listening to this song, staring at the lyrics, and I honestly have no idea what to write about this song. People be doin' things they shouldn't, life's wild man.

---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented one-night stands

**ManofOranges** (9): Another pure bop.

**martymcflurry** (9): i LOVE this one an underrated (and relatable :/) bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): Lady Gaga's Just Another Day did NOT outsell.

**Leixander** (8.5): great album cut!

**teresan527** (8.5): I had this song stuck in my head for days and I kept trying to figure what the hell it was until I went back to give the album another listen.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): this one borders on indie singer-songwriter in the early 2000s, i swear? i also love the microphone effect they’ve used on this song, it reminds me, of all things, of fergie’s clumsy, ha. her delivery of that second verse is so bouncy. and honestly? this is relatable as fuck.

**jamesfog** (8): Better than Just Another Day

**lalodragon** (8): Look I took shots at Kelsea for doing topics that country has already covered a million times, but the thing is, these are universal topics, you just gotta master them and make them fresh. Like Maren did.

**twat\_brained** (8): You mean like this rate lol? I'm on academic probation so I really should be focusing on my readings more tbh.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): "you are just another thing I shouldn't be doing", whoops

**ExtraEater** (7.5): nice title

**christopher\_aia** (7): I can't think of anything clever to say

**piccprincess** (7): Just Another Yeehaw

**vayyiqra** (7): I appreciate that she's trying to inject some edge and some realness into this genre but the thing is this concept has been done so much and it's tired. If I wanted to hear another "I'm so fucked up and missing my ex" song, Tove Lo and Dua Lipa are right there. Anyway, it does kind of bop though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Eh, it’s alright but like, kind of generic and filler-esque.

**qetaz** (6): Well it’s not a standout, but it’s okay. I’d sing along if it came on the radio.

**Shippy29** (6): i started zoning out here

**tapdancingpig** (6): Still boring.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): 🆕

Love Me Like You Mean It was Kelsea's debut single, and it hit #1 on the country airplay charts. It was the first solo female debut to do that since Carrie Underwood with *Jesus, Take The Wheel* (Taylor didn't do it). Speaking of Taylor, Kelsea was actually [a special guest on the 1989 world tour](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6708112/taylor-swift-and-kelsea-ballerini-share-sisterly-love-at-1989) and performed this in Nashville with her. While lyrically there isn't much depth here, the song is just a fun tune to drive around in the summer with the windows down.

---
**gannade** (10): one of the best songs ever made

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This was the other song that proved to everybody Kelsea’s songwriting talents were, without a doubt, a force to be reckoned with. In fact I think when Billboard ranked her songs they put this as #1. The lyrics are so simple, but there’s something to be said for simplicity. She makes a formula (“if you’re gonna ___, do it like this”) and uses it to great effect, turning out one of the most fun songs in the rate. There’s just something so delightful about the way she sings out “love me” three times in a row, it’s a little on the nose, but then she’s not going for subtlety here!

**HerculesMeow** (10): My favorite song on the album for sure, so catchy!

**letsallpoo** (10): her magnum opus. miss tortellini made several points with this one

**ManofOranges** (10): A fun bop to put it simply.

**teresan527** (10): A bop y’all.

**1998tweety** (9): This sounds like it has a weird trap country fusion beat in the background and it somehow works.

**dramiaa** (9): Very catchy, loved it

**jamesfog** (9): A country bop!

**tapdancingpig** (9): I actively believe that pop radio missed out by not playing this song.

**therandomsinger13** (8.7): Since I'm only 15 I remember listening to this on Radio Disney. Better than the previous tracks.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a cute wholesome bop

**christopher\_aia** (8): the other song of hers I knew already, I love how this song takes the bro country format but makes it good, but it's kinda generic

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): This sounds like it belongs in the Sweet Home Alabama soundtrack. It's not bad but I'd rather listen to Love Me Like You Do. Why is Naps forcing me to do this rate I don't even like country that much. I guess I'm fighting score inflation. You're welcome u/NapsAndNetflix you fat whale.

**martymcflurry** (7): fun!

**MissyBee37** (7): Kudos for directly calling out boys who play games.I was going to call this song kind of generic but the melody is still stuck in my head three songs later so I'd be lying if I said it wasn't catchy! She's expressive in her vocal, too.

**skargardin** (7): The Taylor vibes are real here and I mean that in the best way possible

**twat\_brained** (7): Kelsea's making the millennial whoop work here in the chorus. Fair play, Kels. Unfortunately, it feels like she's relying a bit much on it. She's definitely making her lyrics seem genuine, so I give her credit for that.

**vayyiqra** (7): This production is surprising me so far. This is the poppiest album of the three and I'm into it.

**lalodragon** (6): if yuh gunna luh me luh me luh me / luh me like you know how to pronounce words (god this song had so much potential but she massacred the vowels.)

**piccprincess** (6): Yeehaw Like You Mean It

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): The 1975 are shaking

**qetaz** (5): This is shaping up to be an album of serviceable but otherwise unremarkable bops. Also none of this seems very country to me.

**Leixander** (4): generic filler

**Shippy29** (4): unfortunately this just goes into territory where it sounds like every country song post 2008

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): god i can’t get over how formulaic and repetitive her music is, how do you open with a song like xo and end up here only two tracks later

**shineflyer** (3): that drum machine is intrusive. not Florida-Georgia Line level intrusive, but still grating

I really love the whole thing of picking up one of the old dandelions that you can blow to make a wish. The best is when it's like a whole bunch together when I'm walking and you kick them and see the little seeds go wild. However, since it’s out on day one white girls with this tattoo turning into birds flying LOST. Anyways, /u/Ghost-Quartet has a cool writeup so just read his instead of mine thanks

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I have this really weird thing about weeds, dandelions in particular. I love the imagery of them. It dates back to *The Joy Luck Club* by Amy Tan, one of my favorite books. There’s this bit in the book where one of the women compares herself to the weeds in her garden, because she’s dug her roots in and refuses to be removed. Since then I’ve always had this weird fondness for weeds and I kind of like… relate to them? There’s something about their resilience, the way that they live off of scraps but manage to thrive regardless that I kind of admire. I’ll pass by a vacant lot or a barren field and it would be completely empty if not for the weeds that colonize it and bring it to life, even if it’s a gross, scratchy life, and I respect that. Dandelions in particular give me this sense of wistfulness and unfulfilled wishes that really gets to me, they’re one of my favorite flowers and they’re super underrated. And I love what she does with them here, I’ve been in this situation where I place all of my hopes in a boy only to realize that I’ve wasted all of my breath and wishes on something that wasn’t really worth my time. I think this is a really underrated gem in Kacey’s discography and I will anoint it with my 11.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): this is a minimal track, like most of kacey’s songs, but the piano line in this gets me. it’s just a sweet little song that manages to perfectly capture melancholy and beauty so well.

**itsnotrelevantt** (10): That sweet little trill on “Dandelion” makes me melt !

**lalodragon** (10): I fricking love nihilistic sad Kacey

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Awe, I love "Dandelion." It's so pretty. It's sad! But it's pretty and accepting in its sadness. I love the lyrics and the music.

**perfumevee** (9.5): So pretty.

**Leixander** (9): if the rest of album is like this i am ready to be a fan

**shineflyer** (9): i love a good descending bassline. it's a good song for introspection.

**teresan527** (9): Well my favorite flower is dandelion so I guess I’m biased lol. But seriously tho I love this song. This is an example of Kacey soothing gentleness oozing and hitting you in the feels.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): Okay, so I really am not able to tell what song will make Day 3 from this album, but is2g if this doesn’t make it I’ll cut a bitch

**christopher\_aia** (8): the (first) sad bop of the album

**ExtraEater** (8): underrated

**piccprincess** (8): Floral Yeehaw

**tapdancingpig** (8): This one isn’t my favorite off the record, but it’s a pretty little song.

**1998tweety** (7.6): The verses and chorus feel a little disjointed to me, I would prefer if they matched in terms of energy. The verses feel slow and makes me think that the song is gonna be more of a ballad but then the chorus picks up and it leaves me wanting more which I don't get in the next verse.

**qetaz** (7): It’s pretty, with some truely gorgeous vocal moments, but I think Kacey can do better both lyrically and melodically.

**vayyiqra** (7): I don't generally vibe with country ballads but this is nice.

**Shippy29** (6): tbh the lyrics are cute but this doesnt seem very special

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps_ud1SpQOQ

MissyBee37: I need to listen to it again. I listened to *Unapologetically* twice last month (for the first time) after doing this rate; I didn't really know Kelsea before this rate. But it didn't register with me the same way. My only real criticism of *The First Time* was that some of the songs were a bit cliche or generic, but overall, I enjoyed it, some of the songs really surprised me and even the more generic songs were pretty catchy. But I just don't remember anything from the second album except the one song that I instantly loved, "In Between." What are your favorites from her second album?
[/r/popheads/comments/9htivm/new_country_girls_rate_reveal_day_1_different/e6g0ac4/]

=====

melodramatics: It took me a couple listens too, but I think that's why I still listen to it so often. It's a slow burn and doesn't get old after a ton of listens. Honestly, the only song I was never able to get into was Machine Heart, but even that one has been growing on me after giving it another shot a couple weeks ago. The writing on this album is so much more on-par with Peter Pan, which is the only song I really loved from her first album. I know Kelsea hates the Taylor Swift comparisons, but I really did get Fearless and Speak Now era vibes from the lyricism throughout. Especially songs like High School, In Between, Legends, and End of the World. The storytelling is really strong in Roses and Graveyard. Roses really takes me back to specific points of my life, previous relationships of mine that mirror the one Kelsea's singing about. Miss Me More and Get Over Yourself are such empowering breakup songs that help mature Kelsea's image after what I also considered a generic, kind of immature debut album. Music, I Hate Love Songs, and Unapologetically are the "cliche love songs" on the album that took me a few listens, but once I actually started listening a few times,  I couldn't stop. There's something about each that feels refreshing in comparison to what I've been hearing on country radio lately.
[/r/popheads/comments/9htivm/new_country_girls_rate_reveal_day_1_different/e6ic4z0/]

MissyBee37: Thank you! I definitely want to go back and listen again after reading everyone's comments. I love the thought of it sharing vibes with \*Fearless\* and especially \*Speak Now\*; I \*love\* Taylor's \*Speak Now\* and her storytelling in general. I definitely saw that potential for Kelsea on her debut, so I think I just need to give \*Unapologetically\* more of my attention (and a focus on the lyrics) and maybe it'll grow for me.
