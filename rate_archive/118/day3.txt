**Mudkip1** (10): I LOVE FRANCE!!!! it sounds so pretty here even though i could insert the trinity pic that’s like ‘i dont know what the fuck shes saying but girl i am living.’ i did, in fact, look up the translation afterward and i think it makes the song even more impactful! she’s writing about an extremely heart-wrenching, toxic relationship.. it’s definitely worth reading the lyrics to this one

**kappyko** (10): BOP!

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): i adore this song so much

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok WOW how have i not heard this before? this production is nuts

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): God the production of this is just amazing.

**fairytalehigh** (10): I've decided that weird gasping voice in the background is saying "I KNOW!" and it's one of my favorite moments in a pop song in recent memory. Also this song is basically perfect.

**frogaranaman** (10): scratches a part of my brain I didn’t know I needed scratched

**izeasklapaucius** (10): love her voice in this so much

**lIIustration** (10): the production here is gorgeous, i really like the lil jon "yeahs" in the background and they sound fantastic

**pat-rickstar** (10): Glad we're rating the French version because it's superior

**plastichaxan** (10): i’ve listened to the version in english for the longest time and this may be superior you guys were onto something

**richard#0420** (10): banger

**twat\_brained** (10): wow Christine going blow-for-blow with Bree I was not expecting this but I have no complaints

**EnCaine** (9.5): wow this was absurdly well made YEAH

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): bop

**kirby31200** (9.5): Five years of French don't fail me now

**akanewasright** (9): The production is sooooo good here

**hepmeucsb** (9): I gave this song an extra point mainly because her enunciation is good enough (unlike so much French music) so that I can actually understand it.

**LuisEnRod** (9): the beat and the melody are incredibly addictive

**ReallyCreative** (9): yesss Disparate Youth by Santigold, I know French!

**skargardin** (9): what a banger

**Stryxen** (9): fun fact the “YEAH!” noise is actually a recording of me listening to Tei Shi for the first time

**Vromega** (9): As a native french speaker I absolutely love the way she plays with the sonorities and the language.

**waluigiest** (9): love the energy. It’s great in English but beautiful in french

**bbfan132** (8.5): such an infectious song

**AHSWeeknd** (8): come through subtle French bop

**angryparadisecupcake** (8): oh so we are doing this now

**KennyEarthman** (8): I don't know what she's saying but I'm living for it

**relibee2** (8): I don’t understand a lot of French but this bangs

**runaway3212** (8): I love following french for 6 years so I could understand nothing she says here

**SmileandTears** (8): oui oui fromage bleu baguette

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): ok this production slaps

**wavingwolves** (8): wake up!!!! GET OUT!!!!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): I still don't know if I love the beat or hate it. It's fun but also a little obnoxious.

**wryn\_** (7.5): the english version has always been the one on my playlist but i think this is actually better??

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.4): liking the production here

**1998tweety** (7): ok, a bit long

**fallenriot** (7): i wish it built a little more

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): i took two years of highschool french so im just pretending i understand

**NotWith10000Men** (7): like the energy but wish it went somewhere

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): this sounds like beyonce - sweet dreams but french

**musical\_pyn** (6.5): really dig the chorus

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I thought it was underwhelming.

**Brendon-Urine** (5.5): This would be infinitely better without the weird ass shouts in the beat

**CrimsonROSET** (5.5): this sounds like a long version of the gone verse

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.5): There's a lot for me to like in the song, but the random male vocal shout sample and some other elements really rub me the wrong way. I also think the song goes on way longer than it needs to be, I think 3 minutes would have been a perfect length, heck even 3:25 could probably work.

**treecoh** (1): the beat sounds like Beyonces sweet dreams but awful

**Mudkip1** (10): i didn’t care about this track too much until i heard the song while watching the music video. it helps with the vibe! really glad that this made it to day 3

**kappyko** (10): BOP!

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was the first tkay song i ever heard, i just clicked on it on the sub one day and was hooked

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): these bossa nova vibes omg why do I only have one 11 this is so unfair

**CrimsonROSET** (10): hahahahaha it’s funny because I've BEEN sad! Why is everyone on this rate calling me out for being sad! It’s starting to feel like an intervention!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): When this, Shook and Slime make up the top 3...

**endcreditouilles** (10): the range she has!! Close second for my 11, love the brightness and how well composed the melodies are.

**fallenriot** (10): the ukulele (?) into the trap beats is such a good transition

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yeah I am, how could you tell?

**jayjaysortagay** (10): this is such a vibe

**plastichaxan** (10): this is so cute i mean this in the best way possible

**raicicle** (10): the cafe mood of the song really hides the fact that it’s a complete tour de force of a song, hooks for days and really sophisticated melody writing

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i LOVE the instrumental here, so many little details and sounds, Tkay's lyrics really shine on here as well

**relibee2** (10): my immediate fave off this ep is so bubbly and so fun.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): god I love sunshiney songs

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Pleasant sonic shift, I'm not sad about it, sorry Ms. Maidza

**jasannn** (9): Sounds like a SZA song.

**KennyEarthman** (9): she has such a beautiful singing voice

**richard#0420** (9): reminding us that men are indeed, sad

**skargardin** (9): fucking hell this is catchy

**Vultuxe** (9): She sounds like SZA here, and I like SZA, so I liked this one.

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): I love how upbeat and kinda sassy this song is. Her singing "SO SAD!" in the background is one of the best moments on the EP

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): her delivery here is so adorable

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): The chorus of this is making me realising how many songs there are about someone calling at 3AM

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.3): Catchy hook once again.

**bbfan132** (8): fun song to have on in the background (not an insult!)

**frogaranaman** (8): cute bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I had to check to make sure that I was still listening to the same EP, this sounds so different from everything that came before it? The shift to elevator music is nice though

**hepmeucsb** (8): A fun little bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): again, she doesn't miss

**thedoctordances1940** (8): So what's the perfect way to follow up a stretch of 3 brilliant hip-hop bangers? No, I'm afraid that is incorrect, the answer is not a ukelele dri... Oh wait, what's that? I'm being told the answer is indeed a really happy and chill ukulele driven song, who would've guessed?

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this could lowkey be a cher lloyd song but it still bops

**twat\_brained** (8): tkay is right but streaming her music makes me unsad :)

**wavingwolves** (8): omfg i'm sad!!! fuck!!! this song is just like me

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): cute but one of my least favorite on the EP

**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): A sudden shift from the run of 24k to Grasshoper but it’s beyond welcome… the versatility on display here…

**angryparadisecupcake** (7): this is a nice and unassuming bop that does what it’s supposed to do, that is, sound nice in the background of a starbucks

**anothertown** (7): placed very strangely on this tracklist lol

**intheaftermath** (7): I am not sad, thank you very much!!!!

**J\_Toe** (7): she's so versatile in her approach to genre and sound and she master all of them

**musical\_pyn** (7): another great hook, and that ukelele(maybe?) gives this a unique vibe

**SmileandTears** (7): The chorus is kind of obnoxious, which is a shame cuz the rest of the song is great

**Stryxen** (7): yas animal crossing moment

**vayyiqra** (7): Yes I am sad but in the sense of having severe depression!

**wryn\_** (6.5): she's so mean lol

**1998tweety** (6): (should be)

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This beat following the past four songs, we

**lIIustration** (5): this isn't ok but not much worse then that

**kappyko** (5): The first single off 2000AND4EVA, "APESHIT" is a perfect introduction to the weirdo pop monster that Bree Runway is! An ode simultaneously to the musical outcasts of the world and to the musical legacy of Missy Elliott, "APESHIT" is full of the production quirks and eclectic vocals that make Bree Runway as singular as she is. I'm already starting to regret my score for this, but as much as I love the song once the beat switch occurs I feel as if the repetitive vocal hook does not work as well as the hooks on the rest of the project. Still, it's nice to see this do slightly better than it did in /u/DaHumanTorch's rate!

**Mudkip1** (4): the more i hear this the more i don’t care for it:( it’s a bit too repetitive, especially in the chorus

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That you came with? 🧐 That you came with! 😜

**anothertown** (10): slept on track

**Awkward\_King** (10): GO WILD GO STUPID GO

**EnCaine** (10): collapsed on the floor, gasping for air, left looking like a thumb

**fairytalehigh** (10): Sometimes I listen to this song and hear "anxious" instead of "apeshit" and what a 2020 vibe it is, either way

**fallenriot** (10): everything about this song is amazing, and those guitar riffs are so goodddd

**hikkaru** (10): i might actually like this more than damn daniel tbh a bop

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Perfection, love the early 2000’s influence and it’s just a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way she made a better rap song called apeshit than jay z and beyonce

**izeasklapaucius** (10): holy moly electric guitary on a hip hop tracky

**jayjaysortagay** (10): Anyone who gives this less than an 8 is cancelled. Bree Runway is the best act of the 2020s waiting for her breakthrough.

**KennyEarthman** (10): this song makes me feel badass

**LuisEnRod** (10): ok what a way to start an EP. this bangs in the best best way!

**pat-rickstar** (10): Outsold Bey and Jay-Z

**plastichaxan** (10): this was the first single i listened (idk if it was the first overall) and i knew something special was coming from miss Bree, she is such a talent

**pros-and-connors** (10): I had never listened to Bree Runway before and what a first impression this made! 😍

**richard#0420** (10): bars on bars

**Roxieloxie** (10): wild with excitement or anger.

**runaway3212** (10): Imagine outselling Beyonce and jay-z, only Bree can relate

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This is addictive

**skargardin** (10): GO WILD GO STUPID GO APESHIT!!!

**twat\_brained** (10): if there is a better opening track in this rate I can't imagine what it could be

**waluigiest** (10): so high energy and well constructed

**wavingwolves** (10): white girl walking and then twerking discord emote

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): GO WILD GO STUPID

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): That opening guitar solo is one of the best starts to an album/EP/mixtape of all-time

**outsideeyess** (9.3): ok i fucking love this

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): Are you tired of being nice? Don't you just want to go ape shitt?

**CrimsonROSET** (9): shitpost idea: ‘hottest on the market, bitch i’m number one’ looped with all the damn daniel placements throughout rates/this one depending where it places

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Grew off of me a little.

**iniekcja\_** (9): that's a LEAD ladies

**Misentro** (9): It's incredible how this song evolves over 2 minutes 40

**relibee2** (9): I heard so many other things than apeshit it’s not even funny

**vayyiqra** (9): Why is a song with the hook being apeshit apeshit apeshit etc. so catchy? Science cannot explain this.

**akanewasright** (8.5): every now and then I think I don’t like this song, and then I hear “UH - tell me what you WANT” and I realize that it’s actually iconic

**jasannn** (8.5): Maybe I ain't shit

**Stryxen** (8.5): I AIN’T SHIT!! THIS IS FOR ME

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): That opening guitar riff!

**yatcho** (8.5): this one took just a bit to grow on me, i didn't really love the hook, but the verses are so good and she's really serving Missy Elliott here

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.3): she doesn't miss

**bbfan132** (8): fun intro to the mixtape!! i would love to listen to this at a party or something (once this pandemic is over… and i’m an introvert anyway so - maybe a kosmi.io party)

**celladonn** (8): not really a fan of the chorus but the second half of this song is so good

**endcreditouilles** (8): Snatching everybody wig, now they look like thumbs - DEAD I AM DEAD

**frogaranaman** (8): one kid fell into a gorilla pit and then everything went to shit after

**lIIustration** (8): i didn't think the hook was that strong but the song has a great energy otherwise

**musical\_pyn** (8): oh wow what a strong opening

**seanderlust** (8): "snatching everybody wigs now they look like thumbs" submit comment

**slimboyfriend** (8): Giving us two guitar solos in one song like the rocker chick she is

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): literally the definition of going hard

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.7): very nice

**1998tweety** (7.5): beyonce ended but this bops

**J\_Toe** (7): i like the beat, but I think other tracks on this EP are better

**wryn\_** (7): What a banger. Production on this is off the wall

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.7): i wish i liked this more but the hook is more grating than catchy

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): verses and bridge are nice but I wish the hook went harder

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I kinda thought that this was annoying when it came out and I still feel the same way but weirdly enough I like the clean edit that she made for FIFA more.

**SmileandTears** (6): Ngl I don't like this chorus but the rest is really good

**hepmeucsb** (5): It’s definitely not bad, but the hook is just not great and the song feels...messy.

**Vultuxe** (5): I want to like it, but the refrain just sounds obnoxious to me.

**kappyko** (10): **DO YOU LIKE MONEY?** I'm writing this right after my "GUCCI" write-up, and, uh, I lied, this might be my favorite? Which is funny, because I vividly remember actually being disappointed by "ATM"! It felt like Bree Runway's Missy Elliott-influenced brand of eclectic weirdo pop/rap had slightly disappointed on a collaboration with THE Missy at the time. To me it felt as if it didn't do anything that Bree hadn't done before! Yet nowadays I feel more inclined to play "ATM" than any other song on the project; perhaps it instead represents a perfection of the style that she had been building for herself!

**Mudkip1** (10): she SERVED here and so did missy ugh DAMN

---

**BookyCats** (11): (This song has been in my head NONSTOP and it made me a fan of Bree)

**jayjaysortagay** (11): The music video for this is Art and the song goes so hard

**seanderlust** (11): MISDEMEANOR ALL IN THE BAG THAT'S BIRKIN

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Glad the Missy collab ain’t one of the two minute songs

**anothertown** (10): PUSH MY BUTTON, MY BUTTON, AGAIN!!!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this needs a cupcakke remix pls

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Missy Elliot's English accent alone is a 11!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I wish this came out before Damn Daniel because it is better and wouldn't have lost the phcj layout war to Juice. "Tough bitch, but my arse soft" is my favorite 2020 lyric.

**fairytalehigh** (10): LOVE Missy's British accent omg. Also that damn "push my button, my button AGAIN" hook has been burrowed in my brain for WEEKS, SOS

**fallenriot** (10): i’m still so happy she got missy on the song, their verses work so well together and i’m happy she was able to live out that childhood dream

**frogaranaman** (10): hey Bree if I give you my Venmo would you give me some money? my Cashapp is the same handle if that works better

**lIIustration** (10): such a banger, verses are catchy and missy gives a decent verse

**ManofOranges** (10): Missy never disappoints

**Misentro** (10): This song is like crack. I've listened to it 5000 times and I know every word by heart. The POWER of getting a Missy feature so early in your career, and it's such a fun one!

**musical\_pyn** (10): everytime I listen to this song I have it stuck in my head for so much longer than I think it would be

**plastichaxan** (10): i do like money thank you very much

**ReallyCreative** (10): invented cash withdrawal, capitalism simply couldn't

**relibee2** (10): why yes Bree I do like money

**richard#0420** (10): we stan an iconic feature

**Roxieloxie** (10): An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs.

**skargardin** (10): bitch it's the serve

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): literally music video of the year

**vayyiqra** (10): Why does "ATM! AT- ATM!" get stuck in my head so much? Who cares? I love this song!

**waluigiest** (10): I was NOT ready for the Missy feature

**yatcho** (10): completely flawless from head to toe, Missy's verse is so good here I'm so glad she participated in this

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): bop

**dcampb97** (9.2): instant legend with a missy feature

**cremeebrulee** (9): why is missy rapping in a british accent LMAO

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this song has cash flying away emoji energy and that money is going STRAIGHT to missy

**EnCaine** (9): how does she do it??? also s/o missy for still killing it after all these years

**pat-rickstar** (9): I think this has one of her weaker choruses but the production and verses still slap so hard

**akanewasright** (8.7): This has shrunk on me a little over time, but GOD these two work so well off each other. I don’t love the ending of the song, but almost anything Missy touches is improved by her presence

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'll never complain about a Missy feature but that doesn't mean she needs to do a strange accent whilst delivering her bars

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.5): BUT I KNOW HE ONLY WANT MY VAGINA (missy elliott's feature was fire too)

**angryparadisecupcake** (8): missy murdered this

**bbfan132** (8): love seeing missy on here <3

**endcreditouilles** (8): lyrics that use the word vagina >>> lyrics that use the word pussy

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Marx failed to consider ATM

**raicicle** (8): the missy song isn’t even remotely the best song on the ep but that’s just testament to the quality of the others

**steelstepladder** (8): Gotta be honest and say this hook doesn't do much for me despite how great the verses are

**Stryxen** (8): it took me embarrassingly long to understand what this song was about

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.8): very nice

**SmileandTears** (7.7): "My vaginuh" I- 💀

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**engifear** (7.5): Me when I got my stimulus check in the mail

**runaway3212** (7.5): I like this but the chorus is a bit annoying

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I think that's the first time I've heard someone other than CupcakKe rhyme something with the word vagina

**wavingwolves** (7.3): when she rhymes higher with vagina Yass

**ImADudeDuh** (7): lowkey missy’s verse is bad sorry about it

**KennyEarthman** (7): nice bop but that chorus is ridiculously lazy

**wryn\_** (7): Missy's british accent is a little painful but you can't admit youre mad about that kind of stuff on the internet atm cause the americans go rabid. Anyway this is super fun

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): not bree being goofy at the end of the video i-

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): pretty good but that "atm, at atm" gets VERY annoying

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): that beat is kinda ancient right?

**izeasklapaucius** (6): it's neat. I've heard worse Missy verse.

**Vultuxe** (6): Something doesn't click with me, but it's cute.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.7): the best thing about this song is that it leads into damn daniel

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): The Missy feature is cool but this is like the third song on the album in a row with more or less the same theme/sound and it’s wearing thin. I wish Bree would give her songs, like, choruses instead of just repeating words because she has a great voice and I’m sure she could come up with something better.

**hepmeucsb** (5): I like Missy’s part and the outro, the hook makes me never want to listen to this song again though.

**mysario** (2.2): Missy has fallen on hard times

**kappyko** (7): Bree Runway's most overt attempt at creating a link between her and the ethos of Y2K-obsessed pop stars like Rina Sawayama happens to still sound like the future! "LITTLE NOKIA" is a fantastic industrial rock song that, upon release, really excited me for what Bree Runway as a pop star could offer. Name-drops of 2000s pop stars, and, of course, the Nokia phone, evoke an error that so many up-and-comers try to replicate. What Bree does right, however, is evoke the futurism that so many seem to miss. It's one thing to want to sound like the pop stars of the past; it's a wholly other monster to actually feel as exciting as them. I'm glad that our raters took so kindly to this!

**Mudkip1** (5): uhh i forgot to write something for this one lmfao. unfortunately the more i listened to this EP the less i enjoyed it:( so please reread kappy's writeup for this in my place since his is much more substantial

---

**CreepyMannequin** (11): An absolute standout. I love the rockier sound and Bree kills the track.

**EnCaine** (11): this is one of the best 2000s throwback songs ever made

**Misentro** (11): My 2020 song of the year. The industrial rock sound is such a good fucking match for Bree

**Awkward\_King** (10): im :sob: that this isnt the rico version but even this is still a fucking 10 and i'd be insane to give it anything lower

**Brendon-Urine** (10): "he only hit me that text when he wants that goddess level sex" sends wigs into orbit

**celladonn** (10): the Rico version would have been my 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): its a little nonsensical but i freaking love it

**engifear** (10): So true, the Razr flip phone is obviously superior

**fallenriot** (10): her energy is just unmatched

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I think this is probably the peak of Bree’s new hyperpop sound, it’s focused but still replete with hooks… it totally sounds like she says “I don’t mess with f*gs” at one point though?

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): she said she didn't like nokias and now nokia is dead rip

**iniekcja\_** (10): I aspire to be her

**izeasklapaucius** (10): holy moly electric guitary on a hip hop tracky (2)

**jayjaysortagay** (10): I thought she was saying "I don't mess with f*gs" for so long but I was just like 'yes, so true'

**ManofOranges** (10): MEGA BOP OMG

**nootnoot781** (10): the SMILE this song puts on my face oh my god i love bree so much

**nowqueenofpop** (10): Don’t we all hate little nokias????

**pat-rickstar** (10): This song packs so much into 2 minutes that I don’t mind how short it is. I could listen to this on repeat

**plastichaxan** (10): my favorite this ep and so close to my 11, there’s just something so special about this, she IS a pop star

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is Bree's killer song imo. It's perfectly shows off her flair, her great flow, her unique sound, and it's everything I want in her songs

**richard#0420** (10): and the remix too hoe!

**runaway3212** (10): I love Bree so much omfg

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): “Justin, can’t trust him” so true!! The grungy synth-rock sound matched with Bree’s hooky melodies is everything.

**seanderlust** (10): i kind of wish we were rating the rico version but either way this is a banger

**slimboyfriend** (10): I want to MOSH!

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Nokia Corporation is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Finland, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.

**akanewasright** (9.5): Easyfun’s production >>>

**pheromenos** (9.5): I know I'm definitely not crazy when I say I hear Faceshopping. Still a bop.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): This deserves all the attention Damn Daniel gets

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): She name drops Madonna in the song, but this song reminds of "Vogue" in a weird way, just like this super hard post-post-post-modern way LOL

**anothertown** (9): boost mobile is now filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy

**dcampb97** (9): definitely a grower

**musical\_pyn** (9): this chorus is incredible

**NotWith10000Men** (9): guitar is filthy

**ReallyCreative** (9): is there even such thing as a little Nokia? their phones are gigantic

**skargardin** (9): my only complaint is that this ends too soon

**Stryxen** (9): little nokia more like big bopper

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i feel like 14 year old emo me would have LOVED this even more than 25 year old me does

**vayyiqra** (9): I have a Samsung idk does Nokia even still make phones?

**Vultuxe** (9): I don't understand this song at all, but it really slaps.

**yatcho** (9): she can do it ALL

**bbfan132** (8.5): wasn’t expecting a song this noisy but i’m totally here for it

**outsideeyess** (8.3): production is chef's kiss

**CrimsonROSET** (8): what’s yalls obsession with nokias we’ve come so far with phones

**KennyEarthman** (8): I'd give a 10 to the Rico Nasty remix

**notceitn** (8): the rico remix is a 10 tho

**twat\_brained** (8): ended princess

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.8): i get that the goddess level sex line is major but like, its so clunky sounding

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s decent just not a favorite

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.5): Liking the production here

**SmileandTears** (7.5): cute

**frogaranaman** (7): thinking about those memes about how Nokia phones are literal weapons of destruction

**hepmeucsb** (7): Someone’s clearly been listening to a lot of Rico Nasty, but it doesn’t feel overly derivative.

**wavingwolves** (7): this sounds unfinished without rico's verse

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**lIIustration** (6.5): this song felt muddled to me

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I don’t like the vocal filter on this, otherwise it’s great

**angryparadisecupcake** (6): this is toxic gay culture and no i will not be elaborating this statement

**wryn\_** (6): Has a crazy ending but like not in a good way

**sirpancakeXI** (4): This is song is just too abrasive for me. This kind of genre is always a hit or miss either i love it a lot i just hate it with my gut.

**Mudkip1** (10): there are two universes - one where i listed (feat. Caroline Polachek) in the title and one where i didn’t. cause im convinced that this song wouldn’t have done this well had i excluded her name as a feature. sndvhklsndvkj and that’s not me saying the song is bad!!! i truly do stan it, but i think our pop queen caroline had a definite impact on the final average of this song. (i also didn’t recognize her voice on this the first time i listened and was surprised to find out she was on it) anyway, this is one of the few songs that held the winner’s crown during the submission period! it only lasted for about a day though toward the beginning iirc.

we're at the home stretch!! things are starting to get crazy starting now so buckle up

**kappyko** (10): BOP!

**LuisEnRod** (11): perfect song all around, there’s no other way to put it

**twat\_brained** (11): hey look! It's the two protagonists from last year's AMA rate! Forget what I said about about PIBS, THIS is the true DD challenger

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I love the subtlety on this album.

**angryparadisecupcake** (10): that was intense and made me feel things i didn’t know i could feel

**pat-rickstar** (10): A serve, Caroline's part gets me going every time

**plastichaxan** (10): a smash a bop a banger etc etc this is truly my favorite this ep and one of my faves last year they complement each other so well

**richard#0420** (10): WHEW DO I EVEN HAVE TO EXPLAIN

**runaway3212** (10): bop!

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.9): polyglot queens

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (8.5): Polacheck's part is the best and elevates the whole thing

**akanewasright** (8): The melody really reminds me of Je disparais’s, but like... it still works

**Brendon-Urine** (8): Can't help but feel like this would be better as a slower track... like if the rhythmic drum loop was replaced by a more spacey atmospheric instrumental and the vocals were the same. Still a great song tho

**cremeebrulee** (8): caroline ate here

**hepmeucsb** (8): I really like the vocal delivery, but I did not appreciate the outro.

**1998tweety** (7.5): ok, picks up at the end

**Mudkip1** (10): i literally miss SOPHIE so fucking much i can’t even begin to describe it. at one point this song was WINNING!!! and kappy and i were both so excited because i thought we were about to see a posthumous SOPHIE rate win. she gradually fell as the rate went on (all of the way out of the top 10 even!) but thankfully still managed to stick it out at #7. personally, i was expecting this whole EP to get fucking slaughtered since it’s a lot more experimental compared to the other ones, i’m glad that wasn’t the case. 

we’ll miss you SOPHIE

**kappyko** (10): BOP!

---

**Brendon-Urine** (11): this was the only song I knew (well) going into this but I really didn't think it'd be my 11, however after more listens... it deserves. SHE CAME TO FUCK

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Not my musty virgin ass giving this an 11.

**fairytalehigh** (11): SHE CAME TO FUCK

**nowqueenofpop** (11): The second verse quite literally changed my life!!!

**plastichaxan** (11): this is the ultimate serve in every way possible, shy's delivery, sophie and sega's production, everything about this song is just perfect to me

**skargardin** (11): This is relentless, sexy, nasty, and i utterly love it

**yatcho** (11): 2004 r&b meets hyper pop, no you don't understand I'm OBSESSED

**AHSWeeknd** (10): omg this was on the Cyberpunk soundtrack. Literally my fave off it. — Also, SOPHIE ❤️

**akanewasright** (10): I remember how fucking excited I was when this dropped, because it was a new Sophie produced track, and then it sounded as perfect as it does... I miss Sophie so much. Shygirl isn’t winning this rate, but this would be a worthy winner. Between Sophie’s immaculate beat and how well she rides it... it’s simply excellent.

**anothertown** (10): real rottweiler bitch in the streets when i want!!!!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): i have never been inside a club but this makes me want to wake up one morning with green hair, a septum piercing and someone else's credit card and no recollection of how i got any of it

**bulforster** (10): That bass synth + drum line hits so hard.

**celladonn** (10): She's for the streets BITCH!!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): :(

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is a song for our nasty-ass besties! Hearing the beat felt familiar so I checked and turns out SOPHIE produced this and now I am sad because there will never be another one like her. RIP Sophie.

**frogaranaman** (10): so kind of Shygirl to reference Doja Cat’s sleeper hit “Streets” in this song

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah

**hepmeucsb** (10): R.I.P SOPHIE, and I love this lesbian bop

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this makes me feel like such a bad bitch I love it

**iniekcja\_** (10): rip sophie

**izeasklapaucius** (10): i love sophie so much

**KennyEarthman** (10): the SOPHIE production really makes this stand out

**nootnoot781** (10): god i love this. SOPHIE shut down the production on this and i adore the “industrial hoe” vibe. it’s so fucking good.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Both of the pre release singles from Alias are perfection. Weird, dark, freaky bangers

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The only good thing to come out of Cyberpunk 2077

**richard#0420** (10): SOPHIE 4EVER <3

**Roxieloxie** (10): What ingredients make satisfying slime? Slime Recipes that Work When making slime, we like to use a ratio of 2/3 part water, 1 part laundry starch, and 1 part glue.

**seanderlust** (10): she came to FUCK. 11 contender

**sirpancakeXI** (10): a banger

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Now That's What I Call A Slutbop!

**twat\_brained** (10): need to get more into shygirl honestly

**dcampb97** (9.7): you can't spell sega bodega without GOD

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): disgusting, slutty, aberrant trash. Alexa play it again

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Definitely some of the best production on any song from last year, that beat is basically perfect. RIP Sophie.

**wavingwolves** (9.4): she came to FUCK!!!!!

**fallenriot** (9): SHE’S FOR THE STREETS BITCH, AND THATS FINE

**hikkaru** (9): she's for the streets bitch !!!

**intheaftermath** (9): one of my sister's best friends has a slime account with over 170k followers. slimebash is such a surreal event

**raicicle** (9): iconic lyric video may i add

**waluigiest** (9): it’s pretty reserved for Sophie, but still so tight

**bbfan132** (8.5): the chorus is kind of disorienting but i like it

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): rip sophie </3

**jasannn** (8.5): Oh, I remember liking this from Top Songs of 2020 plug.dj event.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I think… I think I'M for the streets…

**rickikardashian** (8.5): “She a baddie for the season or a baddie for the night” is our generation’s “to be or not to be”

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This is a Big Titty Strut anthem

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.2): fuck yeahhh

**vayyiqra** (8): Idk what exactly this title means but it sounds kind of gross but anyway this is a banger I fear. What genre of electronic music is this? Idk but it sounds like nighttime music for cruising around a city. It's cool.

**wryn\_** (7.5): more industrial hyphy please

**Stryxen** (7.4): honestly more could happen cos it blends into the rest of the songs a bit but it fucks ig

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.1): the production makes it sound like this is gonna SLAP but then she just... says words over it lol

**ImADudeDuh** (7): damn she’s british

**lIIustration** (7): i don't find the rapping catchy in any way, but i do like some of the production choices. the vocoder is also not my cup of tea

**Vultuxe** (7): It slaps... reminds me of the previous song though.

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): this seems like a bad dance remix

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Low-key… all the other songs on the EP are better than this one. Good but it just kinda ends? I wish there were more to it

**angryparadisecupcake** (6): yes jojo siwa we know you exist

**J\_Toe** (5): i like the beat, but not to listen to

**runaway3212** (5): this is an exhaustingly mediocre song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): a bit boring

**1998tweety** (3): this is not as bad as i remember from my first listen but i still dont like it

**musical\_pyn** (3): what the fuck is this slurping noise (the rest of the song is fine though)

**kappyko** (10): Did you know "Cumshot" was once not even in the top ten? Near the end of the rate, Magdalena Bay were at the verge of being eliminated before the top ten, but some last minute scores really boosted their performance and managed to snatch them not one but *two* placements in the top ten! I was surprised this was the song of choice over "How to Get Physical," especially when the latter actually made our year-end list for 2020, but I'm certainly not *opposed* to it claiming its spot!  Its newfound success as a "slowed + reverb" remix on TikTok for horny anime edits means it now occupies the top two spots of their Spotify page, and it also happens to be the only song on the EP to be bolded on RYM (don't bully me please!). All of its success is well deserved: it embodies pretty much everything anyone could want from the group. The filtered synth riff, the really sensual "PLEASE GOD KILL ME" lyrics, and its ultimately satisfying climax make it one of the most fun and dynamic songs in the entire rate. It's a shame they effectively got Maggie Rogers-ed in this rate, but hopefully by the time they drop a full project they'll have the adoration they deserve and they too will come third to Sigrid! NOTE: When I got this rate approved for this cycle, I had to tell my friend /u/pickupthephonebaby to change his charity rate pick from "Killshot!" He switched it to Men I Trust's "Tailwhip" which eventually got a very impressive day 2 placement!

**Mudkip1** (10): what a SERVE!! what a SNATCHER!! i talked a lot about the way this EP feels like it blends together but this is the main exception. the bassline and chorus just hits different, i’m obsessed. and i’m so happy to see this make it just barely outside the top 5!! it originally wasn’t doing very hot (i think it was second to how to get physical in the beginning) but then more and more scores  came rushing in and killshot very rapidly launched into the #6 spot.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Giving this my 11 because it’s the song that grew on me the most, I was familiar with it already but it really clicked with me. I really enjoy songs that toy with the weird interplay of violence (the lyrical content) and innocence (the sweet but somewhat dead-in-the-eyes vocals) and sexuality (the way it’s about cum), and the production on this track really is to die for. “Ki11shot” see now doesn’t that look pretty?

**ignitethephoenix** (11): one of my favorite songs from last year, just perfect. Mag Bay needs to blow up already

**KennyEarthman** (11): this song's chorus is hot af

**RandomHypnotica** (11): This is their 2nd most popular song, and for good reason! The bassline is incredibly seductive, the chorus is a total earworm and this song lives rent-free in my mind 24/7

**sirpancakeXI** (11): i almost slipped in my bathroom while dancing to this song, maybe it is actually trying to kill me.

**TiltControls** (11): This is a song that knows how to do just enough with the production and vocals. reminds me of something that would get popular in late 2000's, but modernized in the best way.

**akanewasright** (10): This was the first Mag Bay song I heard, at the club rose event earlier this year. I danced like an idiot to this song, and now not only does the song *slap*, it reminds me of the best memory I have from right after I moved into my dorm for this semester.

**Awkward\_King** (10): if i could invest in a pop act i'd have invested in magbay about a year ago. i'd still be poor. but i wouldn't withdraw my money just yet.

**bulforster** (10): The clit of the EP.

**celladonn** (10): why is this sexier than every shygirl song

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): c*m anthem

**cremeebrulee** (10): this was an 11 contender but then kappy’s campaign about how this song is about c*m started

**endcreditouilles** (10): this song has no right to make me feel this sexy

**fairytalehigh** (10): This song has such "I've seen all the boys on the dancefloor and I choose YOU" energy, I fucking LOVE it. "Wiggly but confident" is such a hard sound to nail and it does it!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): kill me queen

**lIIustration** (10): the layers omg and the synths

**ManofOranges** (10): Cumshot

**Misentro** (10): A revelation

**plastichaxan** (10): i hope this isn’t robbed by you virgins just cause it’s a song about cum :eyeroll:

**ReallyCreative** (10): serving me playing Valorant in my nothing but my jockstrap

**richard#0420** (10): sexy

**rickikardashian** (10): titty gif

**Roxieloxie** (10): i love you akane <3

**Stryxen** (10): im deceased and mica of magdalena bay killed me

**vayyiqra** (10): A fan favourite? An 11 contender? We'll see. If Magbay somehow won with this song, it would be quite a shock. A ... coup de grâce? Masterstroke? Somehow the word for it escapes me. A deadly attack! A winning move! Something like that.

**waluigiest** (10): TASTY it’s all so tasty

**1998tweety** (9): now this is the serve

**anothertown** (9): now this is a GOOD song

**bbfan132** (9): an irresistible bop, love the last minute when it gets a bit noisier

**hikkaru** (9): cum

**musical\_pyn** (9): I wish the ending was stronger but this is really good

**steelstepladder** (9): Finally a bop!

**Vultuxe** (9): This is like Story, I like how unapologetic this one is.

**wryn\_** (9): imagine if eclipse by kim lip (from loona) was cooler (which is hard to do) and you have this song (its amazing)

**EnCaine** (8.7): i can really hear the gwen stefani influence on the vocals of this song, good stuff

**twat\_brained** (8.7): not the best on the EP but I understand the 162k+ streams on SoundCloud, this sounds right at home at #13 on the Hot 100 in July 2007. Wait... I'm at the outro now and now it's sounding more like top 10

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): ok this is not a dig at the lady. She's a fitting vocalist for their songs but I think this song is where i could go with stronger and deeper vocalist. Imagine Marina or Rihanna on this omfg i would collapse.

**jasannn** (8.5): It gives a much needed darker tone to the EP while not feeling out of place.

**mysario** (8.5): this the song that made MGK ditch his rap career to make a weird Blink-182 rip off album, right?

**seanderlust** (8.5): LOVE when it crescendos at the end to a bunch of twinkling keys

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Half of this sounds like a lullaby music box, half of this doesn’t! I like the part that doesn’t!

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): The pre-chorus melody sounds exactly like parts of Lace and Leather by Britney. The hook is memorable, but the song's very run-of-the-mill otherwise.

**frogaranaman** (8): please hit me with a killshot

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): oh bop!

**hepmeucsb** (8): I do like the beat, definitely the most fun song on the EP

**pat-rickstar** (8): It bops but I honestly hate that "I mean it so seri-ous" line and how she pronounces it

**skargardin** (8): :flushed:

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): yeah this is cute

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): their songs are sounding samey but it works on this one

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.4): it's pretty good

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I feel like half of those Vintage✨ accounts on Instagram listen to this

**fallenriot** (7): not my favorite but i love the vocoder

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): eminem wishes

**runaway3212** (6): overrated

Awkward_King: My name Keisha, and I go college
Fuck with all the credit card scammers and the fraudsters
Got good brain but not much knowledge
That's why I get my titties out when I'm with the scholars
See this face, never with the drama
These n***** jaw-dropping when I turn around and park it
I like bosses who handle all my problems
(Can you handle all my problems?)
That's why I like Dan, Dan
Oh Danny, he the man, man
He told my mama he got plans, plans
But he never post me on the 'Gram, 'Gram (Damn!)
Danny switched it up, why he do me like that?
Don't send me heart eyes, now he treat me like crap
Any itty-bitty problem, and he say I'm a lot
Thought I was numero uno, oh, he must've forgot
Say that shit, better watch your back
Better say that shit, better watch your back
Yeah, say that shit, better watch your back
Better say that shit, better watch your back
Yeah, say that shit, better watch your back
Better say that shit, better watch your back
Yeah, say that shit, better watch your back
If you wanna get it, get it like that!

**Mudkip1** (10): miss stine didn’t have to snap so hard on this but she did!!! love a moody queen. i’ve been a fan of this song since she released it, the catharsis i get from the chorus makes me nut. this track sat in the 10-15 range for quite a while until it ended up here. originally, la vita nuova and je disparais dans tes bras were both averaging much higher than this. glad to see the later submitters decided to stan!

**kappyko** (12): BOP!

---

**dcampb97** (11): bitch me too the fuck! this is perfect music

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): I have always admired Christine and the Queens but oh my god I feel so bad for not checking this song last year. I love the mix of English and French here topped with some lavish production I have heard from a pop song. I have debated which song I should give my 11. I have a huge feeling that DAMN DANIEL is going to win with the multiple 11s it might get so I want to give my 11 to a song that I closely identify with. Troye was really close with STUD (see my comment on the song) but given the mixed emotions I felt last year because of quarantine fatigue (and I am sure a lot of users felt this way), Christine gets my 11. Nothing makes me sadder than the dread that the pandemic has robbed me off from half of my young adulthood.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): i picked this one as my eleven because of the emotion that it brings out in me and how timely this release was. I listened to this over and over again during the pandemic and yes, people i've been sad!!

**static\_int\_husp** (11): covid anthem

**Stryxen** (11): i have NO idea what she sings in the bridge but fuck do I sing it with my whole chest

**waluigiest** (11): she released this song and I was sad and then 1 month later the whole world entered a massive depression. it’s harder to rate because it’s just been part of my life for 14 months and it feels like a beautiful old friend, and the other projects are shiny and new to me. But it’s truly gorgeous and honest and Christine, I’ve been sad too.

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): Yes I have cried to this song, how could you tell?

**angryparadisecupcake** (10): yes i know this is an 11 but villain still has my wig, also this made me miss lorde, lorde please come back i’m 25 now and i need you to tell me what to feel, do you want me to base my life decisions on adele’s 25? do you really want that? the world is not ready for that

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): I almost gave this my 11 and I'm still not sure if I should. It never gets old, I love how they put emotion in their voice and make the simple and repetitive lyrics so effective

**Awkward\_King** (10): me posting on my private story that i dont think i've been doing great recently when i've documented it all on said story and everyone is well aware of it, thinking im doing something

**bbfan132** (10): absolutely gorgeous

**CreepyMannequin** (10): yeah me too

**EnCaine** (10): wow this was absurdly well made

**fairytalehigh** (10): Same, Chris, same

**iniekcja\_** (10): one of the best songs released last year i know that's right

**izeasklapaucius** (10): french queen omg

**LuisEnRod** (10): this has been my sad girl anthem this past month

**musical\_pyn** (10): the production and vocals are incredible here

**NFLfreak98** (10): There’s so many different background vocal performances going on and they all work so well

**richard#0420** (10): just....beautiful

**runaway3212** (10): me when I've been said

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): So during winter 2019-2020, I went through some bad depression and isolated myself away socially. When Christine dropped this, I embraced it as an anthem of hope, and the soundtrack to breaking out of my self-imposed shell and reconnecting with my friends. Then the COVID-19 pandemic happened… isn’t it ironic? Anyways, I’ve still BEEN sad but this song still heals my emotions every time.

**skargardin** (10): Honestly an 11 contender, such a pretty, poignant song

**slimboyfriend** (10): and she released this BEFORE quarantine

**twat\_brained** (10): this song is really beautiful but I'm scared it'll beat DD

**Vultuxe** (10): Wow, an actual song.

**wavingwolves** (10): :noitstrue: that people i've been sad

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): This song just feels so human. idk if that's an annoying way to describe a song but if fits really well here imo

**jasannn** (9.5): The perfect quarantine jam.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): bitch me too the fuck

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): yeah

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): It's great, but I'm still baffled why every single publication lost their mind over this song.

**fallenriot** (9): such a chill bop

**hepmeucsb** (9): Just an incredible soundscape

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I honestly did not remember this song being this good.

**lIIustration** (9): i can relate

**NotWith10000Men** (9): love the male backing vocals

**vayyiqra** (9): Same, bestie. Same.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The synths get really pretty towards the end of this!

**plastichaxan** (8.5): no it's true, it's true

**AHSWeeknd** (8): oh... French, I thought the name of the album was Italian

**frogaranaman** (8): this is such a relaxing song

**mysario** (8): so have I but you don't see me making a song about it

**Roxieloxie** (8): me rn:

**Vromega** (8): It begins asolutely perfectly but I feel like it lacks some rythm in the instrumentation at the end.

**whatsanillinois** (8): me too chris, me too

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.7): we live in a society

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): Nice but doesn’t fullly grasp me

**CrimsonROSET** (7): same tbh

**KennyEarthman** (7): such a vibe. the French parts really add some extra pizazz to it

**ManofOranges** (7): Girl me too the fuck

**rickikardashian** (7): i relate to this a lot i wish i liked it more

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): love the haunting vibe to this

**wryn\_** (7): as a long time chris stan its always made me sad that this is everyone's favourite from her when she has actually released 22 songs better than this ( i ranked them /: )

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.7): its ok i guess

**nowqueenofpop** (6.5): The translated bridge goes kinda crazy…

**cremeebrulee** (6): i dont see the hype for this i fear

**intheaftermath** (5.5): please don't kill me for this, it's just not clicking for me?

**anothertown** (5): i understand how people who don't do so well with their mental health may find this very cathartic and meaningful but i personally will not return there with this dirge

**J\_Toe** (4): this may sound silly, but I prefer listening to happy songs

**Misentro** (3): Plodding

**Mudkip1** (10): i’m simply floored by how fucking good this song is. i can basically picture her snatching you up and taking you along for her crazy ass motorcycle ride in the oil slick universe. and i can picture this being the song that plays when she speeds through that surreal and hypnotic world. i’ve gone on similar late-night car rides blasting this track and it makes you feel like such a confident bad bitch

**kappyko** (10): BOP!

---

**endcreditouilles** (11): This is my first time hearing anything by Tkay and wow I want to give this whole EP 11s. I'm so sold on this.

**lIIustration** (11): sheeeeeesssshhhhhhh

**AHSWeeknd** (10): BEATTTT

**akanewasright** (10): I gave this a 9 once in a server rate and I have come to regret that decision

**anothertown** (10): my gyod this so smooth

**bulforster** (10): Her flow here is so precise but smooth it's kind of insane.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (10): Not only the EP's best hook, but the best one in this entire godforsaken rate. Incredible beat too.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): :jassie:

**CrimsonROSET** (10): maybe i WILL mind your business miss

**engifear** (10): The vibes are just chefs kiss

**fallenriot** (10): i’m so annoyed i haven’t checked her out before this rate

**KennyEarthman** (10): I wish Ariana Grande's motive sounded like this

**musical\_pyn** (10): oh I LOVE the production on this, plus tkay's flow is incredible

**pat-rickstar** (10): I don’t see people talk about this song enough, it's breezy, summery pop-rap perfection and one of my favourite songs of last year

**relibee2** (10): I’m not even done with the intro but it’s been one of my faves off the ep for a while so automatic 10

**richard#0420** (10): her voice is literal SILK

**Roxieloxie** (10): Bruno deserved the grammy over lorde, you all have to accept this

**Stryxen** (10): the outro is giving “music on demand”

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of the best songs released last year, Tkay is so diverse and talented. one of my 11 contenders.

**TiltControls** (10): my 2nd choice for 11. underrated compared to shook (though both are 10/10s)

**twat\_brained** (10): this song just reminds me why I love tkay so much, her music is SUPER dynamic and I love artists who can pull that off. This transports me to the trendiest European hotel rooftop and I wouldn't want it any way else🥂

**waluigiest** (10): amazing flow, amazing beat

**yatcho** (10): I need her to keep doing songs like this, the gay community DESPERATELY needs an Azealia Banks replacement

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): Tkay kills it rapping over house beats!

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): this production serves

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this is so slick and fun

**dcampb97** (9.3): she's spitting

**iniekcja\_** (9): very AB-ish, very lovely

**nowqueenofpop** (9): An excellent GTA V moment

**ReallyCreative** (9): groovy

**runaway3212** (9): More like 9k

**wavingwolves** (9): that bridge is just chefs kiss 100x

**1998tweety** (8.5): Magic

**bbfan132** (8.5): :puggodance:

**jasannn** (8.5): It's basically a better version of Motive by Ariana Grande. It has a better chorus and rap verse.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): her voice DANCES on this beat

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Just a really great combo of house and hip-hop, and another great vocal performance by her.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the h&mprint

**intheaftermath** (8): the production on this is so cool omg

**vayyiqra** (8): I love when songs do that fake radio thing because I hosted a radio show for years. Anyway it's a bop.

**Vultuxe** (8): This reminds me of something, but I liked it a lot.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): I'm assuming Azealia Banks is a big influence? The verses sound a LOT like 212 but toned down

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7.5): This song is the musical equivalent of a strobe light. And I love strobe lights.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): very vibey

**hepmeucsb** (7): I enjoyed the beat but it was a bit lowkey for me

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): the mixing is kinda off??? The main percussion overpowers anything else everytime it pounds or idk how to word this properly.

**wryn\_** (6.5): sidechaining on this is so bizarre. its a good song slightly tanked by its production

**angryparadisecupcake** (6): at least is better than bruno’s i guess

**treecoh** (5): why is the audio edited like this PLEASE i feel like im having a stroke

**Mudkip1** (10): say hello to one of the few songs that was winning at one point in the results! in a dream has always lingered in the top 5 positions if i recall correctly, largely thanks to its super low controversy score. seems everyone got tired of shitting on troye by the end of the EP and needed to give at least one song a decent score! sjdnvskjdknj

**kappyko** (10): BOP!

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): one word i reserve only for music i truly love would be euphoric, because it only truly applies to a few songs for me, but this is one of them. it somehow feels so indescribably uplifting and full, i dont know if its the synths or his vocal tones but something about it feels like honey running down my body i love it. all of it feels so beautifully intentional, like i just imagine the feeling in the studio to be so electric when they were making this because they knew they'd just created magic. i love the rhyming patterns. i love the bridge. i love the intro, how it feels like the song is loading in and then it HITS you. i want to exist in this song.

**jasannn** (11): Whenever I listen to song, all I picture is Timothee Chalamet in Call Me By Your Name.

**ManofOranges** (11): This song is actually perfect to me like I just am obsessed with it like the first time I heard it I just couldn't stop it's just SO good. I would love for this song to win or get top 3 or something because to me it truly deserves the world.

**NFLfreak98** (11): TROYE. YOU DIDN’T HAVE TO MAKE THIS BOP SO HARD

**pros-and-connors** (11): this triggers some deep nostalgic feeling in me I can’t describe

**rickikardashian** (11): https://twitter.com/haoeru/status/1360032704323072002?s=20

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The spiritual sequel to Allie X’s Girl of The Year. Also, stan Allie X.

**akanewasright** (10): I love how theatrical and bright this song sounds versus how fucking sad the lyrics are. It sounds like a person trying to convince themself that they’re fine while having a complete mental breakdown.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): synthpop perfection I think

**CrimsonROSET** (10): let’s talk about dream meanings!

**CritneySpearz** (10): so fuckin catchy

**endcreditouilles** (10): encapsulates all my 2020 feels in one track. "There's only so much I can give" I feel that line so much

**fairytalehigh** (10): During 2014/2015 I had dreams of a guy whose face I never saw. They were sexual, lovely and devastating. I'd wake up crying or feeling sad, knowing that it was a dream/wanting to go back. Then dreams stopped coming. This song triggers feelings, in a happy/sad kinda way.

**frogaranaman** (10): this chorus is so fun to shout

**hikkaru** (10): huge bop

**J\_Toe** (10): the first few seconds are stylistically similar to My My My!

**lIIustration** (10): fastpaced and exciting, and the production choices work for me here. great job troye.

**Misentro** (10): There's a hollow inside you / And it won't disappear / Oh no baby the way we work we've got about a year

**pat-rickstar** (10): Probably my favourite song he's made, an 11 contender for me

**raicicle** (10): spiritual brother of allie x’s learning in public, also evokes intense turn-of-the-millenium nostalgia from the strummed guitar

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Easily the best song of Troye's career, it's catchy, fun, and a total megabop. VERY Close 11 contender for me

**relibee2** (10): I DONT KNOW WHETHER TO LET DRUM GO DUM HAVE THE 11 OR GIVE IT TO THIS HELP

**Roxieloxie** (10): one time i head a dream that /u/akanewasright sacrificed me so that blinding lights would win the ultimate rate

**skargardin** (10): more of this maximalism banger type of songs from Troye i BEGGGG

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): yet another 11 intender. a fantastic pop song.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): While it's not quite as powerful as Easy it's still a really emotional track and once again it's just absolutely phenomenal.

**waluigiest** (10): Beautiful writing, fat synths, cute performance. It’s a winner.

**pheromenos** (9.8): I don't know why but I only became obsessed with this song after someone pointed out that it sounds familiar to Allie X's "Girl of The Year." I mean it's true, but it's weird that the revelation was the sole factor that made me realize how good the song is.

**1998tweety** (9.5): cute lil bop to close the EP

**steelstepladder** (9.3): I was harsh on this album but at least it ends on a bop

**hepmeucsb** (9): I LOVE this song! I just wish that intro beat carried into the song a little more

**intheaftermath** (9): I did not enjoy much of this EP but this made it worth it :)

**KennyEarthman** (9): giving me a slight Disney Channel song vibe

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): it's one of the smartest songs i've heard from troye

**ReallyCreative** (9): the only song on the EP that feels fully realized, quite the bop

**richard#0420** (9): perfect for late night drives

**runaway3212** (9): This is a nice closer

**twat\_brained** (9): well Troye certainly is dreamy😏

**vayyiqra** (9): Troye is very good at making new wave-sounding music that sounds like it could literally be from the 80s and I love new wave so that's a good thing

**bbfan132** (8.5): such a fun outro, my favorite song by far on here!

**EnCaine** (8.2): now this i like

**SmileandTears** (8): This is Paradisin's little sister

**Stryxen** (8): oh thank god he made a song i actually like

**wavingwolves** (7.5): this is actually pretty cute

**wryn\_** (7.5): i will never be over 80s revivalism

**angryparadisecupcake** (7): go girl give us… something?

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): it's alright i guess. The back half of this EP is markedly better than the front.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Y'all were overselling this song, though it does have a great post-chorus.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.7): it's listenable

**anothertown** (6.5): movie credits type beat

**Vultuxe** (6.5): I love Girl of the Year by Allie X

**musical\_pyn** (6): not my favorite, it doesn't really fit with the rest of the ep honestly

**Mudkip1** (10): I STAN raveena so much so it hurts to see this go out already, but I’m more partial to her earlier works. Her song ‘Spell’ is my personal favorite

**kappyko** (11): BOP!

---

**1998tweety** (10): queen

**Awkward\_King** (10): everything raveena makes feels like scalding hot water pouring down my throat but its nice

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Magnificent.

**ReallyCreative** (10): a song that is the polar opposite of its title, this is ibuprofen, chamomile tea, a crisp but comfortable fall morning

**Stryxen** (10): i immediately playlisted this thank you 2020 ep bonus rate

**cremeebrulee** (9): been meaning to listen to raveena so i really enjoyed this

**hepmeucsb** (9): Okay yes this song is vibey, but also it’s 5+ minutes and apparently Raveena is South Asian??? So my score might be slightly inflated.

**jasannn** (9): Good dream pop. It reminds me of Billie Eilish - my future.

**akanewasright** (8.5): Really gorgeous

**bbfan132** (8.5): really like how dreamy this is

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): The mid-song switchup is glorious

**seanderlust** (8.4): love the tempo switch

**fallenriot** (8): i like her songwriting

**Misentro** (8): lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax / study to

**richard#0420** (8): perfect song to get stoned to

**Roxieloxie** (8): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

**EnCaine** (7.5): this is cute

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): I was going to give this a lower score when I assumed it ended in the kiddle but then the better second half came in so I didn't

**AHSWeeknd** (7): That beat change really enhances this

**frogaranaman** (7): I thought that title said ‘headass’

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Her music is so pretty but I prefer her other songs to this one. Also we should have included [Giveon - Take Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n30BHPW0w3Y)

**KennyEarthman** (7): the second half is better than the first half, as always the case with these type of songs

**kirby31200** (7): Cute!

**skargardin** (7): ok the second half kinda saved this from getting a lower score

**vayyiqra** (7): Raveena is okay and has potential. This is alright.

**outsideeyess** (6.9): sorry kappy not raveena's best

**celladonn** (6.5): pleasant but a bit too long

**angryparadisecupcake** (6): for a moment i thought the evil queen from the huntsman movies was real and had music

**ImADudeDuh** (6): HEADACHES! You give me HEADACHES!!!

**Vultuxe** (6): It's cute, but long and not exactly my taste.

**wavingwolves** (6): sweet

**CallMeIsmail\_** (5.9): eh

**raicicle** (5): while i like raveena i get the feeling she too often defaults to mood as a substitute for actual songwriting

**Mudkip1** (9): this was a grower!!!! She has such a fun tone and energy that makes me wanna get up and aggressively mosh whenever the chorus comes around

**kappyko** (11): BOP!

---

**bbfan132** (10): holy fuck this is so good, love it

**EnCaine** (10): this was very good and i want to curbstomp the video

**frogaranaman** (10): Remi Wolf record an episode with the podcast challenge

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Love Remi, she’s INSANE. She sounds like what would happen if you gave acid to The Jackson 5. Also we should have included [Big Freedia - Louder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlNI7UhRoyc)

**iniekcja\_** (10): THIS IS SO GOOD OMG

**kirby31200** (10): One of my biggest addictions of 2020. If you like this please check out Disco Man

**Misentro** (10): Love discovering an absolute BOP through a rate

**outsideeyess** (10): my least favorite song on the EP by far but that doesn't mean it's not a bop. everything Remi does is a 10.

**ReallyCreative** (10): there will be 40 comments mentioning driver's license that SHOULD mention Disco Man instead

**starla\_** (10): I wish I could give this my 11

**Stryxen** (10): this is song of every summer from now on btw

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): This song goes the fuck off

**richard#0420** (9): she deserves to be more known

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**fallenriot** (8.5): it feels like it could be the end credits song for a straight-to-VHS rom-com

**Roxieloxie** (8.4): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

**vayyiqra** (8): Remi Wolf has a song that was remixed by Kimbra but it was not this one ! This is a fact that I am bringing up as an excuse to shill Kimbra. I am not sure if I like Remi Wolf. This is catchy but her voice is rather shrill here and it's kind of weird. Neat song though!

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): wish the whole song was the outro

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): I think I like this but it's kind of annoying at the same time

**hepmeucsb** (7): Oh this is a TikTok audio! I like the song.

**KennyEarthman** (7): her voice reminds me of that Dance Monkey girl

**skargardin** (7): this is kinda chaotic but im into it

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.8): I feel as if I've heard this before and not in a good way.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): this was fun but by the half way point i was ready for it to be over

**jasannn** (6.5): Another song that I heard on Tik Tok but I didn't know the name of.

**akanewasright** (6): .......I can’t believe the worst song on this EP was the one that blew up. It’s still well done, but it’s much less of a *song* than the other tracks on I’m Allergic To Dogs. The production is... good? but it also seems like it’s trying to be weird more than it is trying to be coherent or good or hooky. I just wish we were rating Hello Hello Hello or Disco Man or something

**static\_int\_husp** (6): I can't believe I'm saying this, but the remix with Dominic Fike is a lot better

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Well

**J\_Toe** (4): takes to long to get going for my tastes

**Mudkip1** (10): I’m really glad to see this got such a warm response!! kappy and I added this and a couple of other tracks from lesser known acts just to see how they’d do against icons like Shania twain and keke palmer

**kappyko** (11): BOP!

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is such a bop wtf, this is definitely my favorite discovery of the rate

**NFLfreak98** (10): Yes more Wolf Alice/Beach Bunny crossover please

**pheromenos** (10): the way this goes HARDER than most of the actual songs in the rate omg...

**richard#0420** (10): oh my god this is great??!!!

**seanderlust** (9.5): i really like this sound- it reminds me of a pop-heavy "don't delete the kisses" by wolf alice.

**TiltControls** (9.5): never heard it before, but it sounds great!

**1998tweety** (9): inch resting

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): It's better than Easy.

**EnCaine** (9): this is very good

**jasannn** (9): Basically an edgier version of Paper Rings. I hope this makes it to Top 3 Bonus Rate.

**lagozzino** (9): ok the French bridge really got me. Look up the translation of what she's saying if you don't understand.

**Roxieloxie** (9): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

**wavingwolves** (8.8): don't delete the kisses by wolf alice but poppier

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): I like what she's trying to do on the verses, but I can't explain what about it that's off for me. The chorus is fun though

**outsideeyess** (8.5): love her accent, and this outrooooo

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): cute bop!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): god i’m so alone

**frogaranaman** (8): this serve!!!

**Misentro** (8): I Can't Believe It's Not Girli!

**skargardin** (8): ok im definitely listening to this whole ep, this is a bop

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): don't delete the kisses by wolf alice vibes on the verses

**vayyiqra** (8): New wave good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Never heard of her but this is pretty good, I like that rock is stating to creep back into music even if I’m not the hugest fan of the sound. Also we should have included [VINCINT - The Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ooxOORHnwg)

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): could've been a bit shorter but still bops

**Stryxen** (7.5): queen shit

**Vultuxe** (7.5): It reminds me of Don't Delete The Kisses by Wolf Alice. It's alright.

**angryparadisecupcake** (7): you can stay but you're on fucking thin ice

**hepmeucsb** (7): It’s a fun “dance around your room” song but the spoken french was just….uhhh

**kirby31200** (7): Great verses, mediocre chorus

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.6): So she's the pop girl version of Black Country, New Road. Or Black Country, New Road is the indie wanker version of this. Not sure. Either way, it's alright.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): she sounds like a british person and i cant put my finger on it... maybe its every british person

**bbfan132** (6.5): it was decent but it didn’t fully click for me - felt a little boring at points

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): a good song that is brought down by the singing parts

**AHSWeeknd** (6): is this indie?

**fallenriot** (5): i’m really not a fan of talk-singing, the chorus is good though

**jayjaysortagay** (5): no thanks, there's enough posh English hipsters in pop already

---

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I heard the KK Slider version before the actual song but I fucking loved it, you haven't lived until hearing him go aawooOOooOOoo on the chorus it's crack

**frogaranaman** (10): Maia’s songs are always so cute and this is so great

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is excellent

**richard#0420** (10): dawn was AMAZING

**1998tweety** (9.5): cute bop

**akanewasright** (9.5): ...it would be nice to rate this whole project. I like this a lot.

**outsideeyess** (9.3): immediatley added this to my playlist

**cremeebrulee** (9): ok i’ve been so meh on every mxmtoon song i’ve heard, but this is kinda nice? maybe i need to delve a little more into her discography

**fallenriot** (9): i don’t listen to her that much but her music is so soothing

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Love mxmtoon and the direction her music has been going! She’s been a really fun figure to watch develop since her personality is so fun and she just keeps on getting more robust production with her music. Also we should have included [Left At London - Transgender Street Legend Vol. II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owI1UidjiYA)

**ReallyCreative** (9): ukelelecore can be exhausting but mxmtoon does it well, there's no denying her power

**skargardin** (9): all these bonus tracks are serving hello??

**Stryxen** (8.5): this is usually the kinda song i’d be pretty critical of but this specifically is very soothing to me so i’m turning critical thinking off

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is one of the mxmtoon songs i've heard i actually quite like, it feels... full

**ImADudeDuh** (8): wtf the last song of hers i heard was that cute little unspoken words ukulele bop, i did not expect this

**Roxieloxie** (8): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

**fairytalehigh** (7.7): The switchup on the chorus, it's jarring the first time it happens. She has a really lovely voice but this is one of the weaker songs from the EP.

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this is cute

**jasannn** (7.5): The soundtrack to a coming of age movie.

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): driving to the beach vibes

**AHSWeeknd** (7): what a nice beat.

**EnCaine** (7): this is pretty okay

**hepmeucsb** (7): Seems like a nice song to drive at night to.

**vayyiqra** (7): mxmtoon makes cute music. I do not listen to her much but this is nice. In my head her name sounds like "mumtoon". I do not know why.

**Vultuxe** (7): Not bad

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s not really my thing but it’s fine

---

**1998tweety** (10): inject this beat into me

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Might be the best song in the entire rate tbh.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): idk why this is here because I can't find a 2020 EP by this artist but the song slaps all the same

**KennyEarthman** (10): this is a song I'd add to my dance at home playlist

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): cant relate but love that for you bestie <3

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Fun! I don't think the rest of the EP holds up to this, but this is a feel good bop

**pat-rickstar** (9): Wait this is boppy

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I would have preferred it if “Butterflies” was the representative for this EP but the whole thing is good and it would have slain if it had been in the rate proper! Also we should have included [POWDERPAINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfcZ8EKMy88)

---

**1998tweety** (10): BOP. wouldve won the main rate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): NATALIE HOW COULD YOU??

**akanewasright** (10): one of the best disco-flavored pop songs from last year. A fucking bop and a half and a genuine delight of a sad bop

**Brendon-Urine** (10): this sounds like a carbon copy/rip off of about 3 different songs but idc idc idc IT BANGS

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): She's still not a chef and she's still getting caked.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): DISCO????????????????????????????????????

**pat-rickstar** (10): I need to relisten to this EP in full because I forgot how good this song is

**Roxieloxie** (10): dont fuck with my love

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): pls pls check out euphoric sad songs it is SO good!! please don't touch is better imo but still a bop

**NFLfreak98** (9.4): Every generation needs a Jolene

**celladonn** (9): A bop, the bassline reminds me of The Less I Know The Better

**KennyEarthman** (9): that chorus is giving me MAMAMOO - Wanna Be Myself vibes

**skargardin** (9): she snapped

**Stryxen** (9): gay rights!

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): This is what Ava Max wants her music to sound like

**EnCaine** (8.7): natalie sounds like she could do better tbh

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): me when weyes blood tells me she's going to support lana on her tour

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This short album (it’s not an EP!) was one of the most fun “pop” releases from last year and I’m surprised it didn’t get more buzz because it’s exactly up the alley of what pop fans are into right now. This song was the first I heard (check out the Underrated [FRESH] Threads I run) and while it grabbed me, it’s actually one of my least favorites on the album. Still good though. Also we should have included [Olivia O’Brien - The Results Of My Poor Judgement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t7uo9zzJec)

**seanderlust** (8.2): leave him and date natalie tbh

**frogaranaman** (8): Raye is such a great artist

**ReallyCreative** (8): Jolene remains unbothered but its cute

**TragicKingdom1** (8): there's several better song on this EP but still a bop

**vayyiqra** (8): Sorry Raye your man does not belong to you! He is his own person ... honestly that's kind of toxic ... no but jk Natalie please don't interfere with their relationship. Bad move.

**Vultuxe** (8): It's a cute bop, idk I'm at the end of the rate and running out of things to say

**pheromenos** (7.5): The lyrics though..."I'm begging her, not him" 😭

**angryparadisecupcake** (7): i’m not natalie and you are not my real dad

**bbfan132** (7): i feel like i should like this but it doesn’t fully click for me

**kirby31200** (7): I was gonna make a totally funny and not obvious Jolene joke but then she did it for me :(

**jasannn** (6.5): Basic 2014 pop music.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.1): its ok i guess

**hepmeucsb** (6): It’s not bad, but to me it’s quite derivative. Almost sounds like a Future Nostalgia reject somewhere between Levitating and Good in Bed.

**notceitn** (2): I don't like this song bc that's my name and it's awkward hearing it lmao idk but I just can't listen to it at alllll

**Mudkip1** (5): it's ok

**kappyko** (10): I really wanted this one to win! I think CHIKA is easily the most promising artist out of all the artists in the bonus rate, and "Crown" is a glorious victory lap to the beautiful Industry Games EP! Having suffered so much from the vicious backlash of terrible stans, I understand if she doesn't want to return to a music industry that can often be very horrible. Yet at least she'll have left some beautifully written tunes with heart and sincerity.

**1998tweety** (10): this is good oh WOW

**Awkward\_King** (10): this one makes me feel happy

**celladonn** (10): she is the moment

**cremeebrulee** (10): stream once upon a time RN!!!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Okay that second verse called me out, I can't give it any other score.

**frogaranaman** (10): DO NOT SLEEP ON CHIKA

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): such a big CHIKA fan, I’ve been cheering for her since the start and I’m glad she’s been getting some buzz because she’s a cool person who makes great music. The internet trolls need to leave her aLONE! Also we should have included [Ric Wilson - They Call Me Disco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57NT3t8Nlo8)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a queen

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Queen shit

**letsallpoo** (10): this is good how do we unbully her back into making music

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): go listen to all of her music and then feel bad that you hadn't done it yet.

**ReallyCreative** (10): literally one of the best songs released last year, stop sleeping on her it's not cute!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): why wasnt this in the main rate

**seanderlust** (10): this song makes me so happy. like i could really do anything. the second verse start in particular is like the opposite of a gut punch...a gut lift? "this is for the kids with depression/ the ones whose parental expectations got them stressin" .... ninaboninabrownfingerwag.gif

**skargardin** (10): omg this is so good? GO OFF

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm embarrassed it took me this long to listen to chika

**EnCaine** (9.5): this is very good

**bbfan132** (9): love the energy here

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): the EP from this year is kinda better

**nootnoot781** (8.5): i should listen to this EP, this is a summertime bop

**richard#0420** (8.5): this song is so optimistic and motivating

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): Like the way her flow works on the verses. The religious undertones are a turn-off for me though, YMMV

**jasannn** (8): Ok, I could see why the popheads podcast is always talking about her.

**KennyEarthman** (8): nostalgic. sounds like music my dad would play in the car

**Stryxen** (8): crown more like WOWn or something idek

**plastichaxan** (7.5): she has better songs in the ep

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This sounds life pre-wifecore Chance The Rapper

**AHSWeeknd** (7): an optimistic bop

**hepmeucsb** (7): I’m interested in checking out more of her music, as the gospel vibes are great.

**Mudkip1** (11): the 0.1 score difference between her and troye SENDS ME!!!! How iconic. Anyway this was undoubtedly my favorite song in the rate, Tkay oozes badass bitch and none of us were ready for it! i’m very pleased with how the results ended up overall. we won’t talk about K/DA, but no artist truly dominated throughout. it seems everyone liked each of these EPs about equally on average! ~~this song was in the lead for maybe a day? lol, i remember being excited to see it take the crown but i know it was short lived.~~ i just combed through old DMs and this was never winning the rate, kinda shocking since it hit #2 but oh well! this almost always hovered in the 2-4 range.. people liked the song but never seemed to like it enough to give it the boost it really needed. oh well!! congrats to Tkay Maidza regarldess, she has the highest overall EP average and has the most songs in the top 5. we stan!

**kappyko** (11): all im gonna say about shook is that i posted the [fresh video] before people on /r/popheads were paying her her dues, it's an excellent showcase of technical skill over a beat that's brilliantly designed. it's my second most played song of 2020 behind a fucking meghan trainor song

---

**akanewasright** (11): I had issues for DAYS about choosing an 11, but I eventually landed on this. I had options upon options for this, but in the end I kind of thought that this song, while an obvious winner imo, would be one that would make me very happy. I love Tkay, I love her energy, and I love everything she brings to the table, and she deserves the win. I initially was like “I don’t want to boost the obvious winner”, and then I remembered that EP rates are chaos and popheads is racist. This song deserves the win, no matter how obvious.

**bulforster** (11): The Platonic ideal of a banger.

**cremeebrulee** (11): A RESET!!! one of my fave songs to come out last year, even with bree here this was one of the easiest 11s to give out. it put tkay on my radar and i can’t wait to see where she heads next

**frogaranaman** (11): queen

**hikkaru** (11): no bc it slaps so hard... pops off.. bumps in the whip etc etc this was the first tkay song i heard and from first listen i was stanning this better win

**mysario** (11): ugh this song got me SHOOK amirite laydeez

**pat-rickstar** (11): She put two of the best songs of 2020 right next to each other on this EP, her power! The transition from 24k into this and then the outro of this into Awake is possibly my favourite 3-song run on any project of last year

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): ok as an aussie i feel obligated to give an australian my 11 but shook absolutely DESERVES and i'm still bitter it didn't blow up. what a song.

**wryn\_** (11): yeah in context of the ep with that transition to this songs intro it just has to be my 11. a straight hype anthem from beginning to end

**1998tweety** (10): omg this BOPS

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Yes I am

**Awkward\_King** (10): i almost want to give this my 11 for what, i predict to be, an easy win, and it wouldn't even be that much of a stretch because it is *so* good

**bbfan132** (10): total bop alert

**CallMeIsmail\_** (10): STRAYAAAAAA

**CrimsonROSET** (10): holy fuck this goes hard

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Winner alert!

**EnCaine** (10): seismic waves could never do what this song did

**endcreditouilles** (10): big missy elliot energy whew I have been shaken

**fairytalehigh** (10): This song makes me want to jump around like a crazy person. "Pardon me, don't really currr" in verse 2? Iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Wow can’t believe they made a song that describes my state of mind listening to this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): remember that time when people would post “SHOOK” but replace the two O’s with boobs or something? wild

**intheaftermath** (10): it was at this moment that I had to check if there was a Vol. 1

**izeasklapaucius** (10): someone on r/hhh said that tkay needs to stop making songs that sound like car commercial. Personally, fuck them cause i would like MORE of this sound pls.

**J\_Toe** (10): in close contention for my 11. A really fun track

**ManofOranges** (10): Shook after listening to this one

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is what I mean when I say I wish songs would go somewhere

**nootnoot781** (10): that second verse, it’s so addicting

**plastichaxan** (10): she did get me all shook i can't lie

**ReallyCreative** (10): another song that makes me feel way sexier than warranted, a threat to national security I fear

**relibee2** (10): can confirm shook me to my core

**richard#0420** (10): open up the mosh pits!!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): emotionally or physically disturbed; upset.

**seanderlust** (10): THIS IS SO FUN!!! the tiktok line made me smile

**sirpancakeXI** (10): one of the 11 contenders, she just went so hard on this track

**skargardin** (10): what a BANGER!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): FINALLY some good fucking food

**twat\_brained** (10): play the Christine sydelko shooketh video

**vayyiqra** (10): I was shook by this, it's true. [Side note: She really likes Tetris I see. Good taste!]

**Vultuxe** (10): Wait, this is great? The intro, the beat, what the hell. Total banger.

**wavingwolves** (10): WHOA THERE!! I GOT YOU HOOKED!! BUT I'M NOT LETTIN YOU TAKE NO LOOK!!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): What an absolute banger

**fallenriot** (9): her delivery is so infectiously fun

**jasannn** (9): BOP ALERT!!

**lIIustration** (9): the competition shook

**pheromenos** (9): I am definitely shook

**runaway3212** (9): not the best here but pretty good

**slimboyfriend** (9): This song makes me think she has nothing to be insecure about even though the first song of this EP is about being insecure

**waluigiest** (9): 3 straight minutes of earworm, I love it

**yatcho** (9): the transition into this is so damn smooth

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): the beep boops in the chorus >>>>>>

**anothertown** (8): dae cooking by the book

**hepmeucsb** (8): Omg I love how fun this song is! Almost reminds me of Tempo by Lizzo

**iniekcja\_** (8): shook indeed

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Missy’s impact all over this rate huh!

**Stryxen** (8): the chorus drags this down from an 11 but the REST of the song is flawless :(:

**KennyEarthman** (7): Tkay Maidza spitting fire here

**NotWith10000Men** (6.8): this is fine but I've heard this beat a hundred times it feels like

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5): I really was enjoying this until the ending, it just brought the score down a good bit. It sucks when one element can ruin something so good.

**angryparadisecupcake** (4): not shook at all

**Mudkip1** (9): well! here we have it and i hope the subreddit is finally at peace. we can close /r/popheadscirclejerk now we don’t need it anymore. 

i think i gave this a 6 or 7 in the charity rate so it’s grown on me a little bit since then, but it still doesn’t hit that spark for me like it seems to have for the 29 (!!!) of you who gave this an 11. despite the crazy controversy score, this has been in the #1 spot for at least 3/4 of the rate. SLIME, In A Dream, and la vita nuova were the only other songs who held the crown at any point. congrats, damn daniel!!! you're a winner baby

**kappyko** (10): i dont wanna have to rate this again but this was my favorite song of 2020 before it was TK's he can eat shit. forced meme on PHCJ aside i think it's a really welcome encapsulation of Bree Runway's quirkiness and Yung Baby Tate's charisma over the best revivalist production ever. pays off amazingly and although it's not unpredictable it certainly is welcome in my book after seeing how poorly indieheads treated her

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): I didn’t have bias coming into this rate, so the campaigning for this got my eleven. Plus it’s a bop.

**Alumineous** (11): it good

**anothertown** (11): https://i.imgur.com/26v2JDC.jpg

**bbfan132** (11): so fucking good :woeis:

**celladonn** (11): Obviously

**CritneySpearz** (11): periodt

**engifear** (11): When she says "Don't trust the man" she means Popheads raters

**fallenriot** (11): there’s no way i couldn’t give this my 11, phcj rise up

**GloriabellVEVO\_** (11): Just doing my part <3

**ImADudeDuh** (11): its the smasha https://64.media.tumblr.com/30ff7bca8ba72b29d3132aba410545e1/tumblr_od5wwrv2Fo1s87y5ho1_540.gif

**J\_Toe** (11): honestly deserves all the hype it gets. It's r/popheads favourite track since Juice, and for good reason!

**JunkyGS** (11): fourth times the charm <3

**kirby31200** (11): I'm doing my part!

**musical\_pyn** (11): I wasn't going to give this my 11, but then I listened to it again and the ending just compeltely grabbed me again. This has transcended meme status for me and legitimately become one of my favorite songs from last year.

**nootnoot781** (11): the fifth rate this is going to lose :( it deserves better

**ReallyCreative** (11): damn daniel, back at it again with the rate robbery

**richard#0420** (11): left no crumbs

**runaway3212** (11): this song is literally so great, I love it so much and tk was right for forcing it as a meme

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): In a sea of retro-sounding pop songs, Damn Daniel still stands out as fresh and unexpected. I love the back and forth between the characters Keisha and Felicia, and how they don’t fight, but team up to teach the ain’t-shit guy a lesson. Bree and Tate both sound like they’re having so much fun, and it’s such a cleverly crafted track, right down to the cathartic “don’t trust the man” ending. Fire! Girl power! That sneaker kid who?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): this song's track record is really starting to give Potential Breakup Song and im not having that

**TragicKingdom1** (11): will this lose due to overexposure caused by me? probably. do i regret it? no

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): This will lose and it shouldn’t. Yes it’s stupid that we’ve rated it this much over the past year, but it should have won the first time, and it still deserves to win.

**Awkward\_King** (10): IF YOU FUCK WITH HIM HE'LL FUCK ALL YOUR FRIENDS IF YOU FUCK WITH HIM HE'LL FUCK ALLLLL YOUR FRIENDS, DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T TRUST A MAN, I SAID YOU CANNOT TRUST A MAN

**Brendon-Urine** (10): can someone tell me why this is the anthem of /r/phcj

**bulforster** (10): See you in All Stars 5!

**cremeebrulee** (10): i gave this my 11 and watched it go out #19 in my own rate so i will not be giving this an 11 again because that was traumatic. i hope this fares better here tho i wish it the best

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I was aware of this song being Juice'd to death by PHCJ. But damn, I can't be mad if this wins because this song is too much of a bop.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's not winning, but I would love to be proven wrong.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I'll fuck all my friends who gave this a 10/11

**fairytalehigh** (10): Roses are red, my change is loose, stream Damn Daniel and stream Juice <3

**frogaranaman** (10): can this please win so y’all can shut the fuck up about it

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): it’s not and will never be a meme people

**hikkaru** (10): rate fatigue is dumb let this win

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a bop I don’t care if we have meme’d it to death it’s a great song

**intheaftermath** (10): this song makes me wish I liked men so I could relate more

**jasannn** (10): I swear I barely listen to this song but I know all the lyrics.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): Stream HOTHOT!!

**KennyEarthman** (10): that singing part at the end really makes this track very replayable

**lIIustration** (10): her flow here is insane, production is strong and lots of great wordplay

**Misentro** (10): Are you sure? You know your eyes don't be working like that anyway. Hello?

**pat-rickstar** (10): DAE think Damn Daniel good???

**plastichaxan** (10): maybe if i give it an actual 10 this time around it has a chance

**rickikardashian** (10): this has finally beat boss bitch in the “amount of times rated” spreadsheet. congratulations bree!

**skargardin** (10): SAY THAT SHIT BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK!!!!

**SmileandTears** (10): bopity bop

**Stryxen** (10): i already gave this an 11 once im not flopping like that again

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): absolute perfection, deserved to be a worldwide hit etc. nothing to say that hasn't been said

**TiltControls** (10): Will this finally get its win? Or is phcj going to suffer yet again?

**twat\_brained** (10): we should rate every #2 song at some point. I also wonder what the actual Damn Daniel guy thinks about this song lol

**vayyiqra** (10): Stream "Damn Daniel" and give it your 10s and 11s so it can win a rate at last. The world needs to know not to trust Daniel!

**waluigiest** (10): clean and stunning start to finish

**wavingwolves** (10): the fact this song starts with a guy trying to gaslight a woman Yass

**yatcho** (10): idc that we've rated this 3 times in a year it's amazing

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): I was about to give this a 3 bc I thought it was overrated but omg it finally clicked... Juice outsold and more organic but wow

**steelstepladder** (9.6): Can't lie this shrunk on me a touch.

**ManofOranges** (9): Great song but I need to dock a point just because I've gotten sick of the song a little bit and because the Damn Daniel payola on this subreddit has gotten outta control and someone needs to do something! Everyone tried so hard to make this song the next juice but you can't recreate something like that!

**sarcasticsobs** (9): euphoric outro

**seanderlust** (9): okay FINE popheads I like this. I still don't like Closer, but you might be right about this one.

**whatsanillinois** (9): crazy how much better this is than everything else on here

**pheromenos** (8.5): it's a decent bop but I still don't get how it became such a cult classic at phcj

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): insert meme here

**outsideeyess** (8.1): a little all over the place but I like yung BB tate's verse a lot

**EnCaine** (8): sorry if i'm letting you down phcj ❤️ still good

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Maybe this time damn Daniel will place higher than 19th (I’m looking at all of you from AS4…)

**sirpancakeXI** (8): BETTER SAY THAT SHIT BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK

**thedoctordances1940** (8): While it is really good, I don't quite get all the massive hype around this song, she has better tracks

TeiShi_stanaccount: **dcampb97** (7.5): its camp

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I thought this would be a terrible meme song. Yall's advertisement of this really undersold it

**wryn\_** (7.5): I've had to listen to this like 10 times cause of all the different rates and i finally get it

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.2): It's good, don't get me wrong, but I feel it's one of the weaker songs on this project? Not sure why popheads picked this one in particular.

**izeasklapaucius** (5.5): i feel like overtime I dislike this song? Idk but the personalities they bring to the track are still hilarious.

**CreepyMannequin** (5): Don’t get the hype

**Murderousmarty** (5): (great sample on this)

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): really want to like this song more than i do, but i can't.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): When this first came out, I didn't mind it, but I also thought it wasn't anything special. It didn't help that I absolutely DETESTED the Damn Daniel meme, so the title kind of put me off from the beginning. But all the circlejerk and memeing around this song intensified my dislike for the song, to the point where I just get frustrated whenever it plays

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (2.5): I like this song less and less every time I hear it. Thinking about it, I was content with just automatically giving it the 3 I gave it in All Stars, was it All Stars?, but hearing it again felt like taking a cheese grater to my face. The song from the 2:20 onward is something more to my liking, but it doesn't redeem the first 2 minutes for me.

**angryparadisecupcake** (1): this song is like being hit in the face with one of heritageposts tumblr post without a trigger warning

**mysario** (0): "This sounds like someone repeatedly pressing buttons on one of those soundboard things you’d find on addictinggames.com"

**Vultuxe** (0): Stop making this song happen, I have nothing else to say lol.

TeiShi_stanaccount: # Troye Sivan - In A Dream

---

**Overall Average**: 7.530 **// Average Controversy:** 1.965

---

**Awkward\_King** (9.643): i honestly dont know what i could write to justify my score for this EP more than, simply put, it really makes me happy

**waluigiest** (9.286): I remember being underwhelmed by Easy so I never listened to this project, and I regret that so much!!! It’s fantastic. The writing is tight and vulnerable throughout, he uses the most inspired production of his career, and the songs truly have shape. Great project.

**relibee2** (9.071): I know white men are capable of making great music why don’t more of them do that?

**jasannn** (9.071): This is easily one of my favorite albums of 2020 and might end up being one of my favorites of all time. It's a cohesive pop record with no fillers. (I will defend the interlude and 10/10 with all of my heart)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.786): Without a doubt the best work Troye has released, he really seems to be getting comfortable as a musician now, and I'm so excited for what comes next

**seanderlust** (8.457): huh. you know, this was really well-made. i'm impressed by troye's lyricism and ability to show us his point of view without telling. also the production here is spectacular.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.429): I was really tuned out of Troye for most of last year because I didn't connect to Take Yourself Home. I started this rate journey with Troye with low expectations but wow, I think this is my favorite body of work from him. This is Troye at his most mature, but also at his saddest. With the rollercoaster of emotions that Troye felt, I think this makes complete sense to have this as an EP rather than as a full album where the latter has huge expectations to be more consistent. I feel like I am going to go back to being a casual Troye fan because of this EP and I can't wait to hear he has next.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.429): do you think if a woman made this popheads would be nicer to it? I love charli xcx i think she’s a really interesting artist

**AHSWeeknd** (8.143): I saw this album sitting at my local record store and I was like “I should listen to it” but I didn’t. And now I have listened to it but everything’s in lockdown so I can’t even go back and buy it.

**vayyiqra** (8.000): Someday perhaps Popheads will get over its irrational dislike of this man and enjoy his music. I do not expect it will be this day though.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.500): Probably the biggest mixed bag in the rate, Easy almost took my 11 and the EP ends great but also some meh on here. I don't hate anything and do like a lot of it, pleasantly surprised!

**hikkaru** (7.357): not a huge troye fan but he can make a good song if he tries hard enough and there are a couple here so we love that

**EnCaine** (7.000): it's, like, not bad at all. but i also don't really care about a lot of it

**KennyEarthman** (7.000): chill music that can fade into the background sometimes

**iniekcja\_** (6.857): the twink kind of exceeded my expectations

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (6.771): Highs and lows on this one for me. I feel like his choruses really let me down sometimes but every song has elements I really like

**ElizabethDDoS** (6.571): Singles artist.

**skargardin** (6.571): Not everything on this EP hits, but overall it's a step in the right direction for Troye.

**steelstepladder** (6.471): This is so sad Alexa play American Boyfriend by Kevin Abstract which is the superior "sad twink in the big world" project

**plastichaxan** (6.471): troye is one of those artists that i would like to like more, however, it’s difficult when a lot sounds samey, i admire that in this it seems like he was trying to put more thought into his music but i still feel like something is missing for my full enjoyment

**anothertown** (6.143): i've had enough of this dude

**ReallyCreative** (6.071): Thank god we eventually woke up

**Stryxen** (4.000): not once have i had an opinion on a troye sivan song don’t expect any meaningful commentary from me :] - nevermind i just listened to it and it sucked

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (3.286): I just really do not like this EP. At all. I have never had a good time while listening to this.

TeiShi_stanaccount: # Tkay Maidza - Last Year Was Weird Vol. 2

---

**Overall Average**: 8.169 **// Average Controversy:** 1.523

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (10.000): Unquantifiable level of talent.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.563): This is my top 5 album from last year and i'm so happy more people get to know her now.

**pat-rickstar** (9.438): This EP was my introduction to Tkay when it came out in August, and now having been through her previous work I can safely say this is her best project, not a single dud here! Volume 3 can't come soon enough

**steelstepladder** (9.338): Best hip hop ep in this rate?

**relibee2** (9.300): what a fun experience

**CrimsonROSET** (9.250): volume 3 is inevitable and I honestly welcome it

**plastichaxan** (9.162): Tkay did something incredible here, another favorite of mine last year (lol) she’s just great in everything she explores here.

**ReallyCreative** (9.162): it sure was Ms. Maidza, it sure was

**skargardin** (9.125): Consider Tkay officially on my radar because this slaps hard as hell

**hikkaru** (9.063): chefs kiss, tkay is so versatile and it rly shows on this project, one of my fave discoveries from last year

**EnCaine** (8.888): another (crossing my fingers) future superstar in the making

**runaway3212** (8.750): tkay outsold tk

**Stryxen** (8.738): i regret not listening to this sooner oop

**twat\_brained** (8.713): I am once again what the hell happened to KIM when this song list was compiled

**AHSWeeknd** (8.625): You just know Popheads bouta underrate this one

**celladonn** (8.500): The 3 song run of Shook-Awake-Grasshopper is incredible but the rest of this, while good, doesn't quite match it

**anothertown** (8.250): i appreciate that she does multiple genres on this EP but it’s clear as day that she does r&b/funk SO much better than she does hip hop right?

**seanderlust** (8.225): fuck it sure was. this was overall fun! I think I like it better when she veers into more emotionally driven material in the middle chunk of the ep, but overall all of this is quite good.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.188): I am glad I ended my rate journey with this wonderful EP. The middle part of the EP is my favorite and I would be pissed if one of them isn't on the top 10.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.100): I did enjoy some of the singles here, and I appreciate the diversity in sound here, but compared to the other EP's in this rate, it just wasn't my favourite

**vayyiqra** (8.000): It was weird! So true! Anyway this album is good and I want to check out more by Tkay Maidza.

**KennyEarthman** (7.688): I wish the hard-hitting tracks and the soft tracks weren't right next to each other so they wouldn't just... blend

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.438): I can't remember what my original feelings on this EP but I think this listen is a lot more positive than my first. There's a lot of good here but there is also a good bit I'm just not into. The back end of the album is straight fire emoji though.

TeiShi_stanaccount: # Shygirl - Alias

---

**Overall Average**: 7.667 **// Average Controversy:** 1.918

---

**plastichaxan** (10.143): i guess it is pretty clear that this is my favorite project out of the entire rate, to me, shygirl is on another level and she hasn’t released much yet, i can only imagine how much she’ll keep slaying with time and it’s exciting, i love her so much

**ElizabethDDoS** (10.143): Album of the year.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.443): What a fantastic EP, it's got a familiar but fresh sound, Shygirl's charisma and energy shine through, and it's just a fun time

**skargardin** (9.286): The whole EP is just so stunning, Shygirl's rapping paird with the relentless production is honestly everything. I don't think I've heard anything sounding quite like this before and i want MORE.

**pat-rickstar** (9.143): Fantastical, freaky, awesome EP and I am so excited to hear a full album from her

**ReallyCreative** (9.143): it makes me feel very sexy

**anothertown** (9.071): we HAVE to gatekeep this from Ryan Murphy

**seanderlust** (8.971): how in the goddamn world did I miss this EP?? this is the best EP I have heard in a long time. consistently great or better.

**steelstepladder** (8.943): This album is so boringly good I don't really know what to say about it

**iniekcja\_** (8.929): Shygirl legend queen of NFTs

**pheromenos** (8.886): A consistently stunning EP! Looking forward to hear more from her.

**EnCaine** (8.457): just finding out about "sex", seems cool

**waluigiest** (8.429): This is a clean project and it’s really great, even if some of the flows/lyrics sound like drag race verses

**hikkaru** (8.357): i hate this album cover

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.329): Ngl, I was kinda turned off by the cover art that I didn't prioritize listening to the EP. But dang, this is basically another collection of PC Music bops that I have been sleeping over. There's some great stuff here.

**Brendon-Urine** (8.000): THE PRODUCTION. period.

**AHSWeeknd** (7.857): This scares me, but in a good way

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (7.400): Is it just me or do the songs get better and better as it goes

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.186): i like this ep as a whole but the songs individually don't stand out as much (also i feel like its so british that its not gonna be as appreciated :()

**KennyEarthman** (6.857): when this album is good, it's extremely GOOD, but when it isn't... yeesh

**Stryxen** (6.343): what the hell- i like it i think?

**CrimsonROSET** (6.214): It shoots in many directions, and I’m not sure if it succeeds in any of them? But points for variety!

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.000): This is the only EP in the rate I hadn't heard before, hell, I don't even know who Shygirl is. Is this not Shygirl? My thoughts through this entire album can easily be summed up by my comment for TWELVE. I have no idea if I love or hate this. Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know. But I'm vibing over here. The only thing I'm 100% certain of is that I'm in love with her voice.

**TiltControls** (5.857): Sorry, didn't really click with me

**vayyiqra** (5.714): Oh no. My pathological fear of this album is a little infamous on the Popheads Discord. I put off listening to it for a long time, because I don't want to see it. It fills me with dread and makes me feel like I need to throw up. I'm serious, it's highly disturbing. Anyway, enough about that. This album got a lot of hype on Popheads. Will it meet it? Update: yeah it's pretty good I guess. It's Popheads bait for sure. Sorry I ended up giving it my 0 though, which tanked its score by quite a lot. Also it's not fair I've heard every other album in this rate more than once and only heard some of the songs on this once but I am pressed for time so it will have to do.

**SmileandTears** (5.714): **Ajay Voice** I'm gonna need more time with this

**runaway3212** (4.786): okay so turns out im not a shygirl fan, at all.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.443): the album cover looks like if a piece of bologna was a character on the annoying orange

TeiShi_stanaccount: # Magdalena Bay - A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling

---

**Overall Average**: 7.656 **// Average Controversy:** 1.624

---

**sirpancakeXI** (9.938): my favorite discovery from this rate, have been putting this album on repeat ever since the rate is announced

**RandomHypnotica** (9.700): I don't think Mag Bay have ever released a bad song? Like, they're output is just incredible, fun, fresh and poppy, I can't get enough of them, and they're my favourite music discovery of 2020

**ReallyCreative** (9.438): It's fun, summery, and brilliant. You really can't ask too much more from this one.

**relibee2** (9.425): the first half has a chokehold on me.

**TiltControls** (9.000): I had only heard Killshot before, but the whole EP is actually fantastic too!

**Stryxen** (8.838): music to work out to music to do chores to music to have epiphanies to music to laugh to music to get a vaccine to music to fuck to there is not a SINGLE dud here its just bop after bop

**vayyiqra** (8.750): Well, this is a little awkward. My bestie on Popheads, /u/Silvershot335, is the moderator of the Magbay Discord server and has over 5000 plays of them. I have about 90. I'm in that server, yet never check it. This band deserves more attention from me and from everyone. They make music that can only be called "saccharine" and it's very cute and smooth and dreamy and enjoyable. They don't have a bad song in their discography (allegedly their early music is more pop-rock or something and also Not Good but we ignore that). I've seen them called that dreaded g-word, generic, and I get that. They are. If you've heard 80s-inspired synthpop before, of which I have heard lots, this is not anything groundbreaking. However, who cares? Music doesn't always need to be some avant-garde experimental thing to be good. It's fun! Stan Magbay!

**Awkward\_King** (8.688): this project just feels like bliss to me, it feels so calming and filled with just content. definitely a happy place

**KennyEarthman** (8.625): couldn't get through the album at first cuz I kept on repeating some songs

**skargardin** (8.500): Really solid EP all around, which surprised me considering im not that much of a fan of their minimixes.

**rickikardashian** (8.475): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUjMo0ZXkAEsQ-D.jpg

**jasannn** (8.375): Bubblegum-synth pop, emaculate vibes, and amazing production, what more can you ask for? This EP was a good discovery from this rate.

**plastichaxan** (8.350): Magdalena Bay won me over with this one, I don’t even know what else to say but these songs just make me want to dance and chill and stuff so yeah

**celladonn** (8.313): Glad this rate led me to check out this group! many quality bops

**seanderlust** (8.287): everything on here feels so well-thought-out! they really achieve the message and mood they aim for with subtle little choices that are great.

**EnCaine** (8.238): a collection of super solid saccharine pop music, not mindblowing but really nice all the way through

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.000): This is probably the most consistent EP in this rate. If I wasn't in a rush to finish this rate, I would've appreciated this EP a lot more because I liked most of the songs here. I'll definitely give this a re-listen!

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.000): It's pretty good, but I'm lowkey tired of Britney-like voices.

**hikkaru** (7.938): very cute project, i love the singer's voice and the production is so good. excited for what they do in the future

**AHSWeeknd** (7.875): They look like my neighbours; white.

**SmileandTears** (7.750): I got big Imogen Heaps vibes from this? But it's like, Imogen Heap meets CRJ meets City pop? Does any of this make sense? Idk but I liked the ep!

**waluigiest** (7.750): A lot of it is really nice, but there are also songs that just sound like the most generic “chill electropop” and I’m not interested

**pat-rickstar** (7.313): I think I would like most of these songs more if they were sung by someone else, so I tried not to let the lead singer's voice affect my scores too much. It's a decent EP but far from my favourite in this rate

**runaway3212** (7.188): I liked this album a lot at first, but the more I listen to it the more its issues become apparant

**CrimsonROSET** (6.750): At some point, they all started blending together. 8 songs is far too many.

**Brendon-Urine** (6.250): I don't get that much personality off of this honestly, like it's cute and catchy but this is as run of the mill as pop gets. That said their writing pops out on some songs, but when the writing isn't amazing there's really nothin else to latch on to

**iniekcja\_** (6.188): mama this is boring

**anothertown** (5.688): Magdalena Bay is like seltzer to me. light, bright, fizzy, nothing actually there, gives me gender problems from listening to its little-baby-girl voice for too long

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5.537): it's not bad it's just not my thing~

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.250): This EP isn't as good as I remember thinking it is. I really enjoyed this the first time I heard it. Not so much this time. Huh, okay then.

TeiShi_stanaccount: # K/DA - All Out

---

**Overall Average**: 7.587 **// Average Controversy:** 2.024

---

**runaway3212** (10.000): This is literally so great I was super surprised by how much I loved this, by far my favourite discovery here

**pheromenos** (9.960): Although I can already tell this EP is going to be appallingly disrespected, I will not prepare myself and will be mad regardless. All of these 5 songs are literal pop perfection, and the fact that the artists are non-existent and the lyrics and half-Korean and half-generic doesn't make them ho any less hard. This EP is a solid body of work and I will be a shameless apologist for it against these ignorant pop music connoisseurs. I'm a straight up villain!!!

**vayyiqra** (9.800): This is my favourite EP in the rate. On paper, this EP should not work. It is an animated fictional band that makes crossover faux-Kpop, and its members are characters from some video game I've never played that is hated because of its toxic fandom. This whole project is aggressively targeted at gamers, a demographic so notoriously messy it's become a font of endless memes. Their design makes it clear they are meant to be hot chicks who are "baddies", yet one of them has fox ears, which some might find "cringe". [Note: I don't care about this myself; furries are harmless.] I do not have any feelings either way about this gamer stuff so I choose to embrace this band for the ridiculous, over-the-top concept they are. K/DA is the postmodern band of the cyberpunk future that scifi writers in the 80s knew we would have someday. Turn your brain off, it's lots of fun. Sorry not sorry for being the best!

**relibee2** (9.800): can we give albums our 11’s?

**steelstepladder** (9.440): Maybe my lack of K-Pop knowledge is coming out with this one because it's gotten kinda negative buzz in the discord but I kinda loved this one

**hikkaru** (8.700): we wanted pop/stars on the ep

**fairytalehigh** (8.640): I wanted to dislike this EP more than I do. I'm mostly put off by the League of Legends thing (luckily it doesn't really feature into the music itself) and these songs are often just... really busy. But I love K-pop (even if this isn't fully K-pop) and there's some great moments here.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.600): Madison Beer is iconic.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8.600): Thank you for reminding me that this EP exists. This is so outside my normal wheelhouse, but I love it. So. God. Damn. Much. And the funny thing is these artists aren't really those I love on their own, but all together it is just something really special. MORE SUPERGROUPS. PLEASE.

**twat\_brained** (8.460): this EP does not live up to the title.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.400): why am i getting outed as a league of legends player i did NOT ask for this

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.400): Riot Games is a shitty corporation, but apparently its people are great at gay fanservice and making music 🥴

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.300): Wow. It's easy to see how K/DA got a huge fanbase. The K-pop fingerprints are all over this EP and the songs are produced excellently from one bop to another that this doesn't feel like a half-baked attempt for a video game franchise to cross over to K-pop. This doesn't convince me to play League of Legends though but I'll probably pay attention to K/DA now because of their shit slaps. Whoever at Riot Games came up with this idea to make LoL characters as virtual idols needs a huge salary increase because this is really working well in LoL's favor.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.200): more like all out before day 3 because fuck popheads

**TiltControls** (8.200): Unfortunately I don't think any of these match up to POP/STARS. Still, solid stuff!

**Brendon-Urine** (8.100): Mostly what I expected from a League of Legends promo band, but better than I thought it'd be. As much as I want to hate this it bangs. Doesn't change that LoL sucks, where is my Dota 2 girl group

**waluigiest** (8.000): I had never heard of them and this is wild omfg

**iniekcja\_** (7.800): this actually made me find out that there is a league gay community

**sarcasticsobs** (7.800): still cannot believe how good the production is for a fake group for fucking LoL

**KennyEarthman** (7.700): the company didn't need to make these bops, but they did and I am thankful

**SmileandTears** (7.540): Unfortunately nothing on the EP rises to the greatness of POP/STARS but this is still a better compilation of pop songs than most pop albums released last year oop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.440): This EP leaving out their best song POP/STARS is absolutely unforgivable

**sirpancakeXI** (7.300): it doesn't feel right being a lol player and main 3 of them in the game then give my lowest score out of all the album here

**ReallyCreative** (7.000): There's something "uncanny valley" about K/DA as a project, and the Seraphine promo/hype disaster did not help. That said? It's a quality project and I get the appeal. It does feel a bit underwhelming compared to the heavy hitters in this rate, but hey, Riot is just a small indie company.

**plastichaxan** (6.960): This one I was scared for the most, it’s the only one I hadn’t listened to previously but I was pleasantly surprised, especially cause I wasn’t expecting to really like this.

**celladonn** (6.800): On paper K/DA has a lot of aspects I enjoy so I feel like I should like this more but I'm a bit lukewarm on it tbh!

**Stryxen** (6.700): the fact that someone probably gave them a 0… it just is not that serious

**anothertown** (6.400): Sometimes, things that are expensive, are worse

**seanderlust** (6.300): i'm not trying to be rude, but this is gaming music in the sense that you turn it on and tune it out. it's got moments meant to be epic when you do certain moves, but as music? hit or miss. I feel like it keeps going for banger material but it ends up feeling more like royalty free EDM music you can use in commercials for cheap. though I will say I enjoyed this most when I was playing it while playing Persona 5 and only half-listening. that sounds like a read, but I hope you get that I don't mean it as such lol

**EnCaine** (6.060): this kind of sound isn't something i'm crazy about. It's kind of like dubstep where i get why people like(d) it but it just doesn't align with my interests. some good moments though!

**skargardin** (5.800): This ep was honestly a disappointment following Popstars. pain

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.700): a fitting title for a project that deserves to make up the bottom 5 bc it's devoid of any sort of actual identity and feels like underbaked kpop bsides from 2012

TeiShi_stanaccount: # Christine and the Queens - La vita nuova

---

**Overall Average**: 7.923 **// Average Controversy:** 1.639

---

**twat\_brained** (9.500): can't remember the last mostly French project I've heard, I look forward to this!

**Stryxen** (9.480): this is entirely magic no human being should be capable of this much talent

**skargardin** (9.400): Honestly such a strong body of work, can't wait for their return!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.300): So so so glad I got to listen to this wonderful EP because I really admire Christine and the Queens. I love how she shifts from English to French to Italian here and the production of the EP is just so lavish.

**waluigiest** (9.200): A very tight, well put together EP from the most influential person in France

**EnCaine** (9.000): this was my first full listen to a chris project and i was impressed

**steelstepladder** (8.960): Not my favorite batch of songs by Chris but even mid Chris is still pretty great.

**plastichaxan** (8.860): This took a few listens to click with me and I can’t believe it took me long to appreciate how good this is, title track is one of my fav songs last year and this is in general v good!

**ReallyCreative** (8.660): it's great, a little pretentious but great

**RandomHypnotica** (8.580): A lot of tracks on this EP seemed to blend together for me, there was some highlights, but it was far from my favourite in this rate

**AHSWeeknd** (8.400): French!

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8.100): I don't have much experience with Christine & the Queens but generally every time I listen to her I end up more or less digging what I've heard. I should probably actually go and listen to the entire discography at some point.

**iniekcja\_** (7.900): this is a really solid project but I find it almost forgettable with all the other great releases of last year

**vayyiqra** (7.800): This EP grew on me a lot after not liking it much the first time. It doesn't quite reach the same heights as Chris but it's still very good. Quelle surprise !

**SmileandTears** (7.800): I usually avoid music in french because it's my native language and I just feel like so much of it is... well, bad, . Also I will need french people to stop singing in english when that's how they sound like in english

**anothertown** (7.800): this the type of music i put on when i have a migraine, a soft wash of sound that i have no thoughts about whatsoever

**seanderlust** (7.420): people, i'll be honest - this one didn't quite click with me as much as some of the other EPs. it's still quite enjoyable! chris definitely does a great job creating sometimes breezy, sometimes heavy bops that always translate regardless of language. I think I prefer her last album to this though.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.400): This is a good EP I just wish the production was better. There's so much weird vocal pitch shifting, shouts, and generally cheap sounding drums. Chris kills it though, I love her voice (especially when she's singing in French)

**KennyEarthman** (7.300): is it just me or does her vocals sound Michael Jackson-ish at some songs

**CrimsonROSET** (6.400): it’s just not for me. Nothing went anywhere, and I can’t say I saw all the ‘deep symbolism’ everyone else did.

**J\_Toe** (6.400): remember when r/popheads kept saying Christine sounded like Michael Jackson? What was that about?

**hikkaru** (4.500): this rly wasn't for me sorry, i found it quite boring i fear

TeiShi_stanaccount: # Bree Runway - 2000and4eva

---

**Overall Average**: 7.864 **// Average Controversy:** 1.759

---

**jayjaysortagay** (10.000): This is pure art girlies

**ReallyCreative** (9.162): Bree Runway is the fucking moment okay?

**waluigiest** (9.125): This was my first time with this project and it’s SO SOLID

**plastichaxan** (9.050): Bree Runway has not failed to surprise me with each release, she is such a talent and a pop star that keeps me excited and hyped for every release

**CrimsonROSET** (9.000): i mean this is just bad bitch energy

**runaway3212** (9.000): I Love Bree so much, this EP is amazing and I want only great things for her

**anothertown** (9.000): real pop girl shit!

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.875): Reminder that 2ON was robbed in the Charity rate.

**EnCaine** (8.838): i've been so hype on bree runway ever since I first heard 2ON and this EP was had me thoroughly quenched. If she isn't a worldwide star by 2023 i'm canceling the universe ❤️ it's justified

**relibee2** (8.825): my only complaint is that it’s too short

**pat-rickstar** (8.750): Not a single miss among the singles here, a couple of the other tracks could've been fleshed out a bit more, but overall another excellent EP from Miss Runway

**twat\_brained** (8.650): stream HOT HOT because Bree is the future of rap

**vayyiqra** (8.625): I first heard of Bree Runway because /u/DaHumanTorch changed his username on Discord to add "stan Bree Runway!" and he is never wrong about music. This EP absolutely fucks. I can't wait to see what she does next. Obligatory "stream Damn Daniel".

**AHSWeeknd** (8.625): r/phcj was right to stan

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.625): This is a fantastic EP (technically mixtape but for the purposes of this rate, we'll refer to this as an EP). I never knew Bree Runway that much other than DAMN DANIEL and I can see why she garnered a lot of fans in the subreddit. This EP has bops left and right and Bree's rapping style is just so contagiously energetic.

**hikkaru** (8.625): bree is the moment noitstrue

**RandomHypnotica** (8.425): Bree really has everything to be the next main pop girl, she is doing everything right and deserves the world

**steelstepladder** (8.400): Really solid even if some cuts could have been made toward the back

**treecoh** (8.375): loving the rap/rock mashup

**yatcho** (8.313): she's an icon, a legend, and she is the moment. Now come on now

**Awkward\_King** (8.313): i dont know what more i have to say about this mixtape ep that hasn't already been said/i haven't already said. bree is a fucking force and she deserves the world

**skargardin** (8.250): The highlights of this EP proves that Bree has what it takes to become a household name, can't wait to see what the future holds for her!

**seanderlust** (8.188): you know what i really love about this? in this EP, bree blends a number of different genres from hyperpop to pop punk to multiple subgenres of rap to make a collection of songs that are quite different from each other, but the throughline is Bree's charisma. i loved her modernization (or futurization) of pop punk on LITTLE NOKIA, while DAMN DANIEL feels like it's carrying the torch of older tracks like "the boy is mine" with a modern context of seeing the male interest for what he is (frankly, a fuckboy). i thought the tribute to a passed friend was touching. the low rated songs aren't even bad- they're just fine on an EP but unfortunately a couple of 6s will drag the avg down a bit.

**iniekcja\_** (8.125): Bree Runway next main pop girl

**Stryxen** (7.537): i really expected to love this when it came out but a lot of the tracks are forgettable and I came away from it slightly disappointed towards the end - when it hits its HITS tho

**KennyEarthman** (7.375): really drops off after the first 4 tracks

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (4.500): There is always part of me that feels bad when I listen to a project like this and dislike it. On the surface there isn't anything inherently wrong with it. Bree can rap, there isn't any question about that, and I can appreciate that, but all the autotune and the actual music around her is stuff I just can not bring myself to give a damn about. And eventually it ends up bothering me and instead of some neutral rating it trends towards the "worse" side of the scale. But the one thing I just can not forgive is how repetitive some of these songs can be. It just screams to me that they're trying for a viral hit via TikTok or the like, yes I am old and cynical.

TiltControls: Thank you to ~~u/kappyko and u/mudkip1~~ u/TeiShi_stanaccount for hosting today! Those shitposts were quality stuff!!

And like a broken clock, [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) updated!

8 different artists and me having to do my own reveal after this can only mean one thing...

###SPEED ROUND!

Oh hiiiii **K/DA** how've you been? Enjoy your day off while all your competitors were hanging around until the top 7? Well I hope you're well rested for tonight, since you've got another rate coming up soon (shameless video game vocal rate promo continues). At least you can probably expect better things from POP/STARS than what happened to ALL OUT. Anyways, despite the rough placement they still managed to land at the 104/256 overall artist rank which isn't all too bad.

**Shygirl** was the first to fall on day 3, but coming in the final 7 with 6 others left is still quite the feat for an EP rate! She manages to get a spot on the artist leaderboards at 83/256, which is still pretty good!

**Magdalena Bay** came so close to the top 5 yet still couldn't finish it out. At least they exit the rate as the only artist still with no 0's! They join 14 others to take their place on the leaderboards for that stat. As newcomers they also land on the artist ranking leaderboards at 90/256

**Chris** somehow managed to avoid losing anything day 2 and actually came into day 3 quite strong. She's been rated before, so she only rises 3 or 4 spots on the artist rankings. ... I don't really have much else to say here unfortunately so here it is in French (I assume): Chris a réussi à éviter de perdre quoi que ce soit au jour 2 et est en fait arrivé au jour 3 assez fort. Elle a déjà été notée, donc elle ne monte que 3 ou 4 places dans le classement des artistes

**Troye** despite losing a lot of early songs, managed to find his way in the top 3 against all odds! Even though this is the third project we've rated from him, IN A DREAM manages to take the spot as his highest rated song. He also gets his first songeniality with Easy!

**Tkay** had an incredible day 1 (aka no day 1) before kind of bombing day 2. At least she managed to pull it out in the end with 2 songs in the top 4. As yet another new entry on the leaderboard she lands at a solid 41/256. Also - ARE YOU WONDERING WHY TKAY ALSO DIDN'T MAKE THE NO 0's LIST, DESPITE PICKING UP NO 0's? MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK [ONE OF THE OTHER ARTISTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7c3yac/moody_teen_pop_rate_reveal_day_1_the_badlands/dpn39x2/) IN THIS RATE ABOUT THAT

**Bree** well now what are going to meme about being in every rate. Well it's got a confirmed 4th go for Winners 3, which luckily means we'll get at least a bit of a break from it timewise (even if it's always been a 10). Damn Daniel picks up enough 11's to land at #6 on the most 11's leaderboard (tied with Your Best American Girl). Damn Daniel also becomes the 5th winner to pick up more than a single 0 (no one has gotten 3 yet). The EP rate has now been Damn Daniel's 3rd go for the crown (4th if you count Indieheads and 5th if you count the server rate) in roughly a years' time. Luckily for her she finally managed to pull it off. Surprisingly, Bree has finally been rated enough times to make the leaderboard (I know, we all thought the 5 Damn Daniel rates would've been enough). She lands at 35/256 for a solid showing here and from her previous rates.
___
...And that's all!

There might be more stuff that got missed, but we're in a bit of a rush today! So this comment may get updated if anything new comes up

Now I'm off to the discord to reveal the songs voted into the Video Game Vocal Rate (starting at 6:20PM EST ish)!! The full list will be posted along with the rate post in the next hour or so! Join for some fun and pain!
