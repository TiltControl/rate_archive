**Lowest Scores:**

(2 x2) plastichaxan, thedoctordances1940

(1 x2) ImADudeDuh, Roxieloxie


---

**Mudkip1** (8): a part of me wanted to submit ‘I got so high that I saw Jesus’ but this is without a doubt her most popular track on the ep so we went with this instead. Sorry, flop!

**kappyko** (6): I mean sure, it's easily one of the most commercially successful EPs of the year but this is just fine? I don't really care for this at all; Noah Cyrus's pleas to be seen as an independent artist just have not worked on me.

---

**1998tweety** (10): ended miley

**angryparadisecupcake** (10): this is in my real sad boy hours playlist

**fallenriot** (10): this song is so beautifully sad

**outsideeyess** (10): TRULY WISH I COULD GIVE IT MY 11

**Stryxen** (9.5): mentally i'm on a train when i listen to this

**akanewasright** (9): Noah as a person rubs me the wrong way but this song is excellent

**fairytalehigh** (9): The melodies in the chorus are lovely. Could 100% do without the corny whistling at the end though

**jasannn** (9): I listened to this the week before everything got shut down because of COVID, which included my study abroad trip to Taiwan that I was looking forward to. So I can't listen to this song without getting sad.

**Brendon-Urine** (8): this is... really nice? maybe I've been sleeping on Noah

**cremeebrulee** (7): i have personal beef with this song bc it scrobbles under miley cyrus and i literally cannot change it even with last fm pro

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is pretty but she should have just dropped *NC-17* back in 2017. Also we should have included [Isaac Dunbar - Isaac’s Insects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL1uFRMENaA)

**hepmeucsb** (7): Huh, it’s pretty good!

**richard#0420** (7): cute

**skargardin** (7): this is cute

**wavingwolves** (7): i did not expect noah cyrus to sound like this

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): guitar is boring but I'll give a high score to a guitar song for once

**EnCaine** (6.3): this was better than i expected the noah cyrus song to be

**bbfan132** (6): this isn’t bad, it’s just boring as hell

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6): eh

**frogaranaman** (6): oh my god I just got reminded of the Tiktok trend associated with this,

**iniekcja\_** (6): that one was really forgettable

**vayyiqra** (6): She went for a country ballad and it was okay.

**Vultuxe** (6): It was okay but didn't hold my attention

**ReallyCreative** (5): a bad cosplay of good folk/alternative music

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): leon bridges is needed to make this interesting

**AHSWeeknd** (4): I’m listening to this in April though, so...

**Awkward\_King** (3): if this song was called february it'd be more appropriate (fuck february all my homies hate february)

**plastichaxan** (2): is there an emotion that's like more than boring like boring but in the worst way

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this is why you still default to your sister in last fm

**Roxieloxie** (1): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

---

**Mudkip1** (6): I just don’t like Orville much:( it hurts me to have to do this to queen Shania.

**kappyko** (1): DIE!

---

**1998tweety** (10): a gay icon and shania

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Their vocals together is perfection

**Awkward\_King** (10): orville peck

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): [redacted] rights!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Gay rights.

**fallenriot** (10): two legends

**hepmeucsb** (10): I could write a whole essay on this INCREDIBLE song, but instead I’m content to simply say that hearing Orville Peck say “will you strike the match?” in the final chorus makes me melt into a puddle.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): yee haw

**ImADudeDuh** (10): after listening to Show Pony a lot, i have decided that Drive Me Crazy > Summertime > Fancy > Legends Never Die >> Kids >>> No Glory In The West

**pros-and-connors** (10): the EP I was the most upset to see not make the main rate

**ReallyCreative** (10): iconic yeehaw music

**skargardin** (10): we need the audience to stan orville peck right NOW!!!!

**Stryxen** (10): this is camp

**TiltControls** (10): omg country legends!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): we love the 2nd best song of 2020 behind Damn Daniel, let's hope countryphobia and misandry aren't strong enough to push this too low in the bonus rate

**akanewasright** (9.5): ...I think I’m obsessed with his voice. It sounds so... healthy and flavorful? Idk but I want to get into Orville Peck now

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): I love Orville, I love when he leans into the poppier side of his sound.

**angryparadisecupcake** (8): hello lgbtq community

**cremeebrulee** (8): i love orvilles voice

**EnCaine** (8): this is good

**Roxieloxie** (8): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.7): this is how you do a collab

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): You’re telling me that there’s a song in this rate called “Legends Never Die” and it’s NOT by K/DA? Also we should have included [Mickey Guyton - Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXKsmR44IP8)

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): its ok guess

**celladonn** (7): Good but I don't know if their voices really work together

**iniekcja\_** (7): this is just so bland compared to some of the other songs on the EP

**jasannn** (7): Oh this actually a good country song.

**letsallpoo** (7): shania's best vocal performance in like a decade

**static\_int\_husp** (7): every other song on Show Pony is better than this

**vayyiqra** (7): Canadian country icons! I don't like country much but this is kind of neat and I love duets so

**outsideeyess** (6.9): i dont love Orville's voice but this is ok

**bbfan132** (6.5): parts of it are pretty good but i don’t love orville’s voice and the production sounds off

**raicicle** (6): orville is very hit or miss and i don’t think shania actually redeems this song fully

**richard#0420** (6): it’s ok, kinda corny

**seanderlust** (6): i like this mostly for the novelty of this collab and not for the actual song quality tbh. still stoked that miss shania met up with orville. let's go girls.

**sarcasticsobs** (5.5): never heard orville before, cool voice. don’t care for the music

**frogaranaman** (5): why is Orville so LOUD in the mix

**J\_Toe** (5): I'm not a fan of country music :( It's not bad, I just think it's not as globally accessible as pop

**KennyEarthman** (5): yeehaw

**plastichaxan** (5): the way i thought their collab would be a serve cause they're both so good but...well...

**Vultuxe** (5): I just don't do country

**jayjaysortagay** (3): no

**Misentro** (2): Yee haw music? In my rate?

**kappyko** (5): Rumor has it Prince Philip listened to this and died on the spot.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This vocal filter works here more than Little Nokia

**lIIustration** (10): this hits so hard, production is louder then it should be but she's so good for the entire song

**musical\_pyn** (10): this energy is incredible

**nowqueenofpop** (10): The first time I heard her say “serving you drama sex fashion couture and everything snazzy” my soul left my body and I ascended to a higher plane of existence

**richard#0420** (10): the other girls are shaking

**sirpancakeXI** (10): why is this freestyle kinda the highlight of the album

**waluigiest** (10): I was ready to be underwhelmed but she has bars holyyyyy

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): REAL POP GIRL SHIT

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): Also, no sirree. Certainly not. This emphatic denial is used without regard to the gender of the person addressed. For example, No sir, I'm not taking her up on ...

**anothertown** (9): serving you drama, sex, fashion, couture, and...... everything snazzy......

**runaway3212** (9): short but good

**akanewasright** (8.5): NO SIR, YOU CANNOT SPEAK FOR ME, NO SIR

**Mudkip1** (10): i like this song a lot!!!!!!!!! and this 100% deserved better than what it got.

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Hearing the TWICE girls all over this song made my ONCE heart so happy. If this doesn't convince some of y'all to check out TWICE's discography then I don't know with y'all. Also, I do like how this song was chosen as a closer to this bombastic EP. It shows the K/DA's more casual, sensitive side of themselves which is nice and gives the virtual K/DA members some personality.

**frogaranaman** (10): what’re you showing me? huh? WHAT’RE YOU SHOWING ME?

**GloriabellVEVO\_** (10): This sounds like a DCOM song omg

**notceitn** (10): the bridge <3

**runaway3212** (10): This is literally so great

**twat\_brained** (10): if K-DA put out an album that has at least 5 songs like this they're well on their way to year-end lists

**wavingwolves** (10): JIHYO MY BELOVED [46973]

**fairytalehigh** (9.9): Gearing up to be one of my most played songs of summer. Definitely my favorite song here

**anothertown** (9.5): This singlehandedly saves the project. We all need this

**yatcho** (9.5): twice does not miss in any language omg

**vayyiqra** (9): Overhated! This song seems like a weak closer at first, but it grows on you. It's upbeat and wholesome and inspirational and blah blah idk I just need that right now okay. :hanawinsExcite:

**Vultuxe** (9): Wait, I liked this one! The production is great.

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): the most conventional synthpop song with the least EDM influence being the best track on the EP? it's more likely than you think, but the ending is a little anti-climactic. Might need to check out TWICE though

**jasannn** (8.5): Of course, my favorite song on this EP is the poppiest but honestly, they all gave really good vocal performances.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this sounds like a hannah montana song. that’s not an insult

**SmileandTears** (8.5): The r/QueensOfLeague drama that surrounds this song has me dead. Also this could 100% be a Carly song, change my mind

**Stryxen** (8.5): league of LEGENDS these girls are legends for making these

**EnCaine** (8.3): i'm glad there was a track on this EP i really enjoyed!

**1998tweety** (8): shes...cute. the league gays have universally agreed that this is the worst song on the EP but its still ok

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Pales in comparison to the rest of the EP.

**fallenriot** (8): now this is a bop i can get behind

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): wait low-key this is the best song on the EP

**hepmeucsb** (8): Very “Lemonade Mouth in 2020”

**izeasklapaucius** (8): whaddaya know? The best track is the last track :onika:

**slimboyfriend** (8): I still think this song is good even when I remember this whole thing is a League of Legends venture

**thedoctordances1940** (8): The only song from this EP I actually properly like. Unlike the other tracks this doesn't really suffer from some over the top production and the melody is really cute, I actually see myself coming back to this.

**bbfan132** (7.5): nice outro!! probably my favorite

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): get this song in a coming of age chick flick asap

**NotWith10000Men** (7.4): my favorite happy chorus in like three months

**bulforster** (7): A bop, but a bit bland.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): it really took the whole EP to get a decent song and even this feels underwhelming

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this sounds like a DCOM ending track, it’s cute

**engifear** (7): This song sounds like it would be in a Disney Channel Original Movie (I mean this in the best way possible)

**KennyEarthman** (7): good, doesn't fit in the album tho

**musical\_pyn** (7): bop

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.9): its ok i guess

**richard#0420** (6.5): meh

**wryn\_** (6.5): jihyo ate this up and left 0 crumbs

**AHSWeeknd** (6): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl7XOLxX0AIO1Ac.jpg

**akanewasright** (6): I like the positive energy here! It never seems to stick with me,  and I think a few parts of the song are a little... unpolished perhaps? but that’s nice at least.

**LuisEnRod** (6): not a fan of this bubblegum pop sound but I like the synthpop vibe it’s got going on

**Roxieloxie** (6): display or allow to be perceived (a quality, emotion, or characteristic).

**skargardin** (6): this is fine, I actually really like Jihyo's parts here

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5.8): a bit too cheesy for me

**Brendon-Urine** (5): I think this is the only song here where the "fakeness" of the group gets to me, the verses are nice but the chorus gets annoying after a while

**lIIustration** (5): standard kpop closing credits

**waluigiest** (5): the only miss of the album, the lyrics are just sooooo corny and not fun enough to redeem them

**iniekcja\_** (4.5): I've only heard it once before and I remembered it to be way worse tbh

**cremeebrulee** (4): imagine having a skip on a 5-song ep well i don’t have to

**plastichaxan** (3.5): no<3

**Mudkip1** (7): i do love magdalena bay, however i can’t escape the realization that some of their songs feels rather one-dimensional. i love this EP dont get me wrong, and i also feel that not every artist has to make a soul gripping, evocative record, but there are times while listening that feel a bit hollow. i’d classify this song as one of those times. she’s a cute girl but i feel like i’ve already heard her sing this exact song before. the final chorus kinda serves though!

**kappyko** (9): A very sweet song from Mag Bay that climaxes the most effectively out of almost all of their other songs? The glitch-y vocals are pulled off very well!!! WHat more is ther to ssay

---

**raicicle** (11): the end of this song is the embodiment of the mike wazowski screaming meme image

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the bridge made me go from a 9 to a 10

**lIIustration** (10): soaring, magical, but why did the first part have to stop and not go into a chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This was the first Mag Bay song I heard, and honestly I think it still might be my favourite (it was a VERY close 11 choice), the plucky little synth in the pre-chorus is amazing, the build to the chorus is wonderful, and there's just this magical, romantic feeling to the track which I adore SOOO much

**seanderlust** (10): this is a BOP. oh that build is amazing

**Stryxen** (10): “all along we had good intentions” - everyone literally sabotaging the rate

**Vultuxe** (10): These songs are actually lightyears better than anything in this rate.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Picture perfect, you don't need no filter Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you're a killer Shower you with all my attention Yeah, these are my only intentions Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread Heart full of equity or an asset Make sure that you don't need no mentions Yeah, these are my only intentions Shout out to your mom and dad for makin' you Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you When I create you're my muse That kind of smile that makes the news

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): It hits that sweet blissfully melancholic pop vibe like Body Talk-era Robyn or "We Found Love."

**jasannn** (9.5): That outro is on some Rainbow Road shit.

**KennyEarthman** (9.5): feels so nostalgic yet so modern as well

**yatcho** (9.5): ok now THIS was a bop

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): Good Intentions? Well. Good Intentions... never felt that, never been through that, Good Intentions, never experienced that E•MO•TION, truly, never never don't know what that is, only know millions have it

**Awkward\_King** (9): this feels like garage music but if it were made of clouds and had a nut allergy warning no i will not be elaborating

**dcampb97** (9): obsessed

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I really like the weird “cybernetic” feeling of this one

**skargardin** (9): the production mmmm

**vayyiqra** (9): This sounds like an outtake from Emotion. That is a good thing. Listen to the synth bass on the chorus. It is good.

**richard#0420** (8.5): her voice is beautiful in this one

**SmileandTears** (8.5): BOP

**bbfan132** (8): v pretty song, almost reminds me of charli at times

**intheaftermath** (8): this song sounds like one of those kawaii pink kitten gamer setups

**waluigiest** (8): the synths make up for the boring vocals

**anothertown** (7.5): more pop songs should use these kind of high fluttery strings idc if it’s washed!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The breakdown in the end is my favorite part of this EP

**twat\_brained** (7.4): the y2k music trend may be on its way out but MB are providing a great case for a last stand alongside Bree

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.3): very pretty ending

**fallenriot** (7): kinda forgettable but still a vibe

**frogaranaman** (7): very cute

**pat-rickstar** (7): Sounds like she's singing "these pizzas in my brain?" Bumped up my score a bit for the very nice outro

**steelstepladder** (7): Wish the chorus bopped a little harder

**wryn\_** (7): this songs outro is insanely euphoric but a lot of the rest doesnt really do it for me, annoying

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): While listening to this for the final time I was at first wondering why I gave this song such a low score, but then I realised that I was anticipating the Chorus for Airplane to come on and so when the pretty annoying bouncy synth came in instead, I was pretty disappointed to say the least.

**akanewasright** (6): I never listen to this outside of the EP, but it’s still really cute.

**angryparadisecupcake** (6): i mean it’s nice but not my cup of tea

**nowqueenofpop** (6): This is ALMOST there, again a great prechorus, but something is a little off…

**NotWith10000Men** (5.2): meh on this one. Way too much at the end

**CrimsonROSET** (5): the road to hell is paved with annoying synths i guess

**musical\_pyn** (5): again, I really needed more from this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): for a song that tries to be interesting it sure is boring

**AHSWeeknd** (4): good intentions ≠ good song

**hepmeucsb** (4): If you’re gonna give me a club beat, give me more please

**runaway3212** (4): this is a snoozefest

**treecoh** (3): this is so noisy

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (1): This song starts out okay and then just gets worse and worse as it goes along. It gives me a headache.

**Mudkip1** (7): after relistening i think this is by far my least favorite song on the EP. don’t have too much to add.. it kinda just comes and goes

**kappyko**: this had to grow on me but the final chorus makes me cum fr fr

---

**bluehxrizon** (11): something about this is very 2009 emo synthpop and I cannot resist

**Vultuxe** (11): I'm actually shocked at how much I enjoyed this song and EP in general. Magdalena Bay's music is very "slice of life" and romantic... I haven't heard this style of pop pretty much anywhere else. This is stellar, and Airplane captures all of that perfectly.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): production!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): it just feels like bliss

**Brendon-Urine** (10): an example of brilliant songwriting carrying a song, the chorus is amazing!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): My favorite on the EP, the final chorus goes the fuck off, and the build-up to it was excellent as well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): low-key my favorite song on the EP but I feel like I’d “waste” my 11 on it because I know I’m kinda alone in that opinion but I adore the subtle pathos of this song, there’s an air of melancholy about it that I think really gives it an edge

**ManofOranges** (10): Holy fuck I just got CHILLS

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way the last minute of this song is an absolute blast, Demi Lovato simply couldn't

**richard#0420** (10): ethereal

**runaway3212** (10): this has some great lyrics

**sirpancakeXI** (10): may have ascended when she sing the line "i'll overflow"

**skargardin** (10): what a gorgeous song

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I really adore the melody on the hook, it manages to feel sad but at the same time really familiar and comforting.

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): Love songs that sound like they could be about the one that got away just as much as they could be about self-interrogation. Kind of a sad but weirdly optimistic vibe.

**jasannn** (9.5): Its vibe reminds of f(x)'s Airplane which is a very high compliment.

**Stryxen** (9): and just like that my worries dissolve - i can literally feel my back pain disappearing when i listen to this

**wryn\_** (9): this makes me ugly cry

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This isn't a BAD song, it's just my least favourite on the EP

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): Share B.o.B - Airplanes (feat. Hayley Williams of Paramore) [Official Video] B.o.B - Airplanes (feat. Hayley Williams of Paramore) [Official ... https://www.youtube.com › watch Lyrics Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

**rickikardashian** (8.5): early britney would have murdered this track

**SmileandTears** (8.5): Big bop

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I missed the mention of airplanes but vibes are very much there

**bbfan132** (8): i like how it starts off quiet and dreamy and progressively gets louder throughout

**fallenriot** (8): i love how understated this is

**lIIustration** (8): digging the piano not digging the word airplane

**musical\_pyn** (8): my favorite on initial listen, really dig this chorus and the end

**wavingwolves** (8): i love the singer's voice in this

**akanewasright** (7.5): The ever so slight build of the song is just so... perfectly done. The last chorus is a delight

**seanderlust** (7.5): the lyrics on this EP are consistently solid

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.3): nice hook

**outsideeyess** (7.1): don't love the vocal delivery here

**1998tweety** (7): jhope and f(x) ended them

**Mudkip1** (10): i can totally understand why this ended up being her first track out. still kinda makes me sad though since i think it’s a very pleasant introduction to the chaotic nature of the rest of her EP. also, the lyrics in the chorus are a bit one note, which i think hurts the flow of the song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): absolutely FUCK flowers but this song is great

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.4): marina on social media for the past 6 years

**cremeebrulee** (7): i like the chorus but not the rest so much

**frogaranaman** (6): probably my least favorite on the EP just because it feels as if it doesn’t go anywhere

**hepmeucsb** (6): Nice vibes overall

**Vultuxe** (6): The repetitive chorus doesn't sound pleasant to me unfortunately

**wryn\_** (6): cool intro but probably one of my least favourite here

**Mudkip1** (10): one thing i have to comment about this EP that was mentioned to me by a good friend is that Troye decided to be so unusually inconsistent with his capitalization/punctuation for the track names. why does this have an exclamation mark and use sentence case? why are two of the tracks spelled out in all caps? why is the interlude the only song with no caps? why do the other two tracks use normal title case? much to think about

**kappyko** (9): 'I like this cuz a nice boy likes this' was his original comment and then he also wrote this: I like this because a nice friend likes this. But even then, "Rager teenager!" is very effective at building its atmosphere! While Troye may no longer be a teenager himself, it's always appreciated to have someone understand the importance his work held for those growing up with his work since 2015. A song like "Rager teenager!" might not be for the Troye of now, but it almost feels like it was meant for the Troye of years past; maybe even for a new generation of teenagers that will grow to have someone like Troye Sivan as a pop star they can claim.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): why not capitalize the T in teenager?

**Awkward\_King** (10): this feels like it came at a perfect time in lockdown, people were confronted with themselves and only themselves so much we all reverted back to our old selves in many ways, and getting in touch with your teenage self while also expressing great frustration with being stuck inside eternally is the perfect doubled up way to do this. i love how the lyrics are kinda immature, they feel perfectly youthful, while not being cringy, just nostalgic and green

**Brendon-Urine** (10): gays who were suppressed during their teenage years make some noise

**endcreditouilles** (10): this whole EP has such a timeless sound, I feel like it takes me back and forward at the same time.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): for a song called “rager teenager exclamationpoint” you would think it would go harder, but it doesn’t NEED to go harder cause its great how it is

**ManofOranges** (10): Bop but also reminds me that I'm not a teenager anymore :(

**musical\_pyn** (10): that synth is impeccable

**waluigiest** (10): okay hear me out…. Golden Girl by Frank Ocean

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): im just a teenage dirtbag baby

**akanewasright** (9.5): I love songs that use not just lyrics but melody and production to like... express a feeling, and this song fucking nails that. Over the course of our time with C*VID, I think many of us have gotten fucking restless and just wanted to DO something physical, even something self destructive, but not being able to do anything at all, and this song captures that feeling better than any other song I can think of, even if this was written before any of that went down.

**jasannn** (9.5): I JUST WANT TO GO WILD! I JUST WANT TO FUCK SHIT UP!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): okay he got me here with the synths… I wish it like, went OFF during the chorus though or had a crazy post-chorus though because that would take it to the next level. That’s a thing I wish Troye would do in general, just go a bit harder.

**hepmeucsb** (9): A few clunky lyrics in this otherwise incredible song, oh the outro is amazing too

**lIIustration** (9): the glitches are awesome

**richard#0420** (9): makes me miss being a teenager

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): ok this one is kinda cute

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Troye and I are both in our mid-20s but the teen angst is still in us so I relate. This song is definitely to grow on me.

**relibee2** (8.5): these unexpected hard ass beats coming in are gonna be the death of me

**runaway3212** (8.5): a cute bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): damn this makes me ache with nostalgia

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): This one reminds me of the last guy I was with, things ended because he was in his early 20s and kind of a mess. Even then I still have a soft spot for him. Idk this one just strikes a nerve and I don't know how I feel about it.

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I don't believe it. Troye has condensed the once-in-a-generation debut record that is Pure Heroine into a brief 3 minutes. What an artist. Points off for the slight sensory overload at the end though

**anothertown** (8): don't you just want to go ape shitt

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): this could've been an interlude and CCJTAY could've been a full song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): season of screaming is here loves, study for your finals! haha help me

**frogaranaman** (8): the way this song builds throughout the entire thing is dope as hell

**vayyiqra** (8): It has been quite a while since I was a teenager and it's weird to look back on those years now and what a time it was and how foolish we are at that age.

**Vromega** (8): the whole song is not as good as its intro but still fine.

**Vultuxe** (8): A great song but Troye you are 25 and pretending you're lovestruck at 19

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It doesn't have a completely unnecessary electronic breakdown so that's a positive I guess

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.1): It's pretty solid but I still don't really believe him.

**bbfan132** (7): the production sounded nice! not totally my thing but still

**pat-rickstar** (7): I mostly like this sonically but not a huge fan of some of the lyrics

**ReallyCreative** (7): there is a skeleton of a great song here, but it just doesn't do enough. I like the closing part of the song but it hardly feels like a proper climax. It just doesn't soar the way I feel like it should

**wryn\_** (7): good melody even if the production is a little too blown out

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): what I would expect a stereotypical Troye song to sound like

**plastichaxan** (6.5): "i just wanna go wild" then sound like it please i want to like your music

**fallenriot** (6): i feel like it kinda wasted all the momentum it had going for it

**iniekcja\_** (6): this is not the anthem he thinks it is, I fear

**skargardin** (6): this title really is something

**TragicKingdom1** (6): not bad but still have no idea why this was a single

**steelstepladder** (5.7): I sleep

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): those drums were badly needed. Wish they were in it more

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (5): I appreciate the Red Hearse vibes but the chorus is such a letdown for me

**nowqueenofpop** (5): TFW a song title does not match the song itself

**wavingwolves** (5): exists

**angryparadisecupcake** (4): mmm why?

---

**angryparadisecupcake** (11): the production in this song is immaculate, somebody call the pope cause we gotta make madison and kim saints, also my friends didn’t notice that two people were in this, they didn’t notice the switch

**outsideeyess** (11): one of my most played songs of 2020 so naturally it had to be my 11

**pheromenos** (11): This song makes me want to become a dominatrix and kidnap a bunch of men. World-dominating bad bitch anthem.

**1998tweety** (10): now this is the serve, they did not have to eat this hard.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): MADISON BEER AND KIM PETRAS?? WITHOUT THE EVIL MAN?? I love this

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I'll literally be doing anything around my apartment and spontanesouly start singing the chorus and dancing like an idiot

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this has big siren energy, soft and sweet until it goes in for the kill

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): DADDY RAISED A WILD ONE, DADDY RAISED A FIEND, PULLING UP ON B*TCHES EVERY CHANCE I GET, VILLAIN OF THE SCENE.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Kim is perfect for this

**engifear** (10): if I'm alive, I dont alive bc I did. No I didnt❤️

**hepmeucsb** (10): This song really makes you feel like a straight-up villain

**intheaftermath** (10): oh my god step on me please

**LesApfels** (10): Kim and Madison's voices work so well together

**LuisEnRod** (10): the standout track until the next song starts playing

**Misentro** (10): Mommy~

**NotWith10000Men** (10): that chorus is like crack

**raicicle** (10): madison and kim are literally indistinguishable here but also a lack of dr luke is always a good thing

**richard#0420** (10): no I’m shaking....

**runaway3212** (10): we better hear chillin like a villain after this

**wavingwolves** (10): now why do i fuck this hard with this song... i guess i'm a baddie

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): Evelynn queen of pop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9.5): the second verse is PERFETION wow

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9.4): it's INSANE how good this song is

**akanewasright** (9): Okay, *that’s* more like it. I’m not sure why I like this song so much more than the earlier tracks. It’s probably because I find this hook to be a lot stickier than the last few. Also - I tend to be lyrically minded, and these lyrics sound really fucking fun to sing.

**cremeebrulee** (9): i’m the bad guy …. duh

**lIIustration** (9): good lyricism and good productions! feels a bit long especially near the end

**vayyiqra** (9): This song seems like it's kind of weirdly dark for this otherwise very bright, poppy album. I have no idea how Kim Petras ended up on it but I'm into it. The bass in the chorus slaps. Woo-ah.

**waluigiest** (9): Kim shines here

**yatcho** (9): why does this feel like a turn off the lights reject.... still bops though

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): Not me liking this because it reminded me of Turn Off the Light and only realizing like 10 listens later that Kim is literally on it 🤡

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this sounds like kim petras

**seanderlust** (8.5): YES. this is the best on this EP so far

**anothertown** (8): Mrs. Beer, please don’t get me wrong because i love your songs but the girl really has the most anonymous voice on Earth

**celladonn** (8): evil woman sexy

**plastichaxan** (8): the way this kinda sounds like something off of turn off the light was unexpected omg

**sarcasticsobs** (8): absurd how the prechorus is so sick that it makes up for the slightly disappointing chorus

**twat\_brained** (7.6): okay yeah this confirms it k-da is just straight up not doing it for me even with a Kim feature

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): that chorus is amazing

**musical\_pyn** (7.5): another song that grew on me as it went

**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): I think, instead of MORE, we should talk about this one

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.1): its alright i guess

**ReallyCreative** (7): Figures these two would feature here, Kim knows about villains from collabing with Dr. Puke, and Madison knows about being a villain towards people with taste

**skargardin** (7): this is good but it needed that extra oomph to really shine

**SmileandTears** (7): No thoughts head empty

**astrologicalangel** (6.5): I wish I liked this more than I do

**jasannn** (6.5): All build, no pay off.

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): 1 : a character in a story or play who opposes the hero. 2 : a deliberate scoundrel or criminal. 3 : one blamed for a particular evil or difficulty automation as the villain in job …

**bbfan132** (6): the verses were fine but it was pretty boring overall

**J\_Toe** (6): better than the other tracks on the EP, but still not something I would voluntarily listen to.

**CreepyMannequin** (5.5): I really like the verses but the chorus is simaltenously basic and very annoying

**izeasklapaucius** (5): if i had a nickel everytime Kim Petras' vocals are indistinguishable with a featuring artist on a song I'd have two nickels.

**pat-rickstar** (5): Don't really like the chorus, the whole song feels kind of flat to me

**Stryxen** (5): no filling so true

**Vultuxe** (5): I know popheads overhyped this one a bit, I don't exactly get it.

**EnCaine** (4.5): i was excited when i saw kim but :/

**fallenriot** (4.5): back at it with the descendants vibes, but wayyy too on the nose for me lyrically

**sirpancakeXI** (4): madison sweetie this is not it...

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This *should* be a good song because it has such a good idea conceptually but it lacks in good ideas musically

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): "am i really that bad?" yes, yes this song is

**frogaranaman** (0): this is a very uninspired villain

**Mudkip1** (6): the relaxed flow here doesn’t land with the same effectiveness as the other tracks in this EP. it’s definitely not bad but i’ve never wanted to listen to this over songs like Shook or You Sad.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): jam is overrated

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I prefer Chocolate Hazelnut Spread.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Everything about this is so clean and groovy, the production, the lyrics, the composition, her voice, I am just blown away.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I love the groove of this song, the instrumental is so smooth

**waluigiest** (10): It’s such a smooth and beautiful song. It reminds me of a blend between Steve Lacy and Kali Uchis, if that makes sense.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is sooo sweet, there's no other way to describe it

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. It commonly contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture,such as

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Jelly found losing the house in the divorce while PB living large with the second husband

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): Tkay's singing ehh but she absolutely crushes the chorus in this song. "Time is not the issue" is also such a resonant line for a year where time seemed to lose all meaning

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**lIIustration** (9): wait up!

**richard#0420** (9): funky bop

**akanewasright** (8.7): UGH every song of hers is just too damn infectious

**bbfan132** (8.5): i love the radio intro

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8.5): Peanut butter + pickles is the best sandwich combo. Thank you for attending my TedTalk.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): stan tkay

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): this is smooooth

**cremeebrulee** (8): the best radio on the planet

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me when i spill my jelly all over myself again

**NotWith10000Men** (8): so swanky

**runaway3212** (8): This is a bop

**skargardin** (8): very funky

**vayyiqra** (8): This is very smooth which is intentional because this song is canonically meant to sound like what a peanut butter and jelly sandwich tastes like but in musical form, which is a weird concept, yet it works

**Stryxen** (7.9): “til we can understand PB Jam” yeah I really dont understand it but it bops

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.8): It's cool and the hook's great but overall it's sorta just there.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): good but forgettable

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): chill bop

**seanderlust** (7.5): must be jelly cause jam don't shake

**twat\_brained** (7.2): groovy but doesn't fit the EP vibe I don't think

**AHSWeeknd** (7): isn’t it usually “PB and Jam?”

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this reminds me a lot of Kali Uchis, also the pre chorus is a lot better than the actual chorus

**musical\_pyn** (7): this is such a jam

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): weakest on the EP for me

**Vultuxe** (7): It's chill, I didn't hate it.

**frogaranaman** (6): I don’t understand PB Jam yet

**hepmeucsb** (6): It’s not bad but overstays its welcome

**intheaftermath** (6): not my favorite but god that's a great song title

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): Why they put the peanut butter in the jam? Fuck you

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): the intro is the highlight of the song unfortunately

McIgglyTuffMuffin: I love that you actually went and did this.

I truly think peanut butter is a blank canvas and most people don't utilize it to its full potential. I'm really fond of peanut butter + spicy pickles + Trader Joe's Mushroom & Company seasoning. 

PB + pickles + bacon is also a good combo too.

=====

Apprehensive_Guest: Ok that mushroom seasoning combo sounds delicious. I love peanut butter and I'll try it with almost anything, but my issue is getting a sandwich that's more than just the sum of its parts. I think spicy pickles and some seasoning could step this up to that next level

**kappyko**: I honestly kinda don't get why I made Mud add this and I kinda wanted it to be withdrawn because it's cute but it's really, like, a nothing song! It's a cute representation of what PC Music does now, but perhaps that's more of a bad omen more than anything.

**Mudkip1** (10): “Party!” - Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova

also kappy can suck my cock, i like the song and didn't wanna withdraw it after he showed it to me. jsndkvjsnlk

**iniekcja\_** (10): PC music supremacy!!!!

**richard#0420** (8): I love their lo-fi sound

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): and it's not even the best song on the EP!

**richard#0420** (9.5): a beautiful acid trip of a song

**akanewasright** (9): This was a whole ass journey oh my god

**fairytalehigh** (9): 🤑

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is pretty, I always love a track that mixes an old school doo-wop sound with more modern, electronic production. Also we should have included [iyla - other ways to vent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGu-MCJmqwc)

**Stryxen** (9): this is so confusing

**outsideeyess** (8.9): the production is incredible wow

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): this is like Tennis meets the concept of evolving your sound

**EnCaine** (8.7): this is GOOD

**celladonn** (8.5): Definitely an intriguing group. My favourite off this EP was Robert but this is interesting too

**kirby31200** (8.5): Honestly my only prior experience to this group was Beavercore 3 so this wasn't what I was expecting, give me Beavercore 4

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This is beautiful, but too complicated for me to properly appreciate 😭

**hepmeucsb** (8): A daring song that I would probably enjoy a bit more if I was on drugs.

**jasannn** (8): Beautiful instrumental.

**Roxieloxie** (8): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

**skargardin** (8): the acid they're speaking of is the chromatica jockstrap

**bbfan132** (7.5): this was hard to get a grasp of since it went in 500 different directions within 4 mins but i think i enjoyed it?

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): slow dance in a dystopia vibes

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.4): Pretty neat, Warp has taste.

**Vultuxe** (6): I didn't hate it but didn't seem memorable.

**wavingwolves** (6): it starts getting really interesting by the middle of it but the first part is boring

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (11): When I, somehow, finally become a professional baseball player this is going to be my walk up music.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): why do I like this?

**angryparadisecupcake** (10): bea miller really did snap in this

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This really feels like POP/STARS 2.0, albeit slightly worse.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Popheads gamers rise up, there are dozens of us!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): slapper this goes hard in the gym

**LuisEnRod** (10): SUBMIT TO THE SOYEON AKALI SUPREMACY (yes ‘Kali You the GOAT)

**mysario** (10): this is the closest we're getting to the video game vocal rate so therefore its good

**runaway3212** (10): We love a bop

**vayyiqra** (10): What an intro! This slaps! Those harmonies are so good!

**1998tweety** (9.5): massive bop, soyeon ATE. this would be a 10 if it had a last chorus

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): abrupt ending but idc it bangs

**Awkward\_King** (9): the goodest

**CrimsonROSET** (9): justice for the extended version!

**fallenriot** (9): this feels like a reworked descendants movie reject in the best way possible

**hepmeucsb** (9): I haven’t played LoL in years, but damn I love this song and the whole EP

**KennyEarthman** (9): would be a 10 but it ends too abruptly

**pat-rickstar** (9): This bangs so hard but it has the most anticlimactic ending, feels like it's building up to an epic final chorus and then it just stops :(

**richard#0420** (9): Bea not being boring for once

**SmileandTears** (9): Bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): first time listening to K/DA and this is amazing??? i love it

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): babes the baddest EP in this rate is Troye's, and it's pronounced "worst"

**jasannn** (8): Too short and the abrupt ending sucks but still a banger.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This is decent, but the end feels like it's missing something

**Vromega** (8): As a long time fan, I was so happy when I heard Bea Miller was involved in this project. At first a bit disappointed about the song but it grew a bit on me, especially Bea's parts.

**wavingwolves** (8): wow this is actually so good for a quasi-kpop song!

**celladonn** (7.5): soyeon kind of went off

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this turned heads

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): that first soyeon verse is insane

**sirpancakeXI** (7.5): the rap verse is a turn off for me, but overall a good song

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): of poor quality or a low standard.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.2): it really grew on me by the end. I like their energy

**bbfan132** (7): i liked how bombastic it was, even if it ended abruptly

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): Not keen on the hook

**lIIustration** (7): this is supposed to be fast-paced but also feels really slow, the rap verse is fire and should be the entire song

**musical\_pyn** (7): wait I was not expecting to like this?? It doesn't live up to my initial listen, but still good

**skargardin** (7): This is probably the best track on the EP which isn't saying much

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6.9): if only the ending wasn't so abrupt

**dcampb97** (6.7): didn't really go anywhere

**twat\_brained** (6.7): I forgot about wolftyla, glad he's still doing bomb-ass production. As I presumed, Bea Miller sounds very out of place on this song which unfortunately diminished the quality for me

**akanewasright** (6.5): ...I have mixed feelings about this. The production feels like a bit much, considering the song it’s accompanying, but I do like the energy of the performers.

**fairytalehigh** (6.5): Woah, Soyeon you the GOAT 😲 Damn she's EASILY the best part here. The production is crowded and honestly outdated. Also in terms of "bad bitch anthems" the EP already has "Villain" and it's way better.

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): the chorus is really good! and verses is ok i guess

**wryn\_** (6.5): don't like wolftyla's bit that much but the rest is very good

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): you’ll never be “POP/STARS” but this is mildly okay

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the chorus kinda sucks and the song just... ends? The verses are good tho

**seanderlust** (6): league of legends?? like....the game????

**frogaranaman** (5): pop trap production machine go brrrrr

**Mudkip1** (9): it’s got a good beat and you can dance to it

---

**bulforster** (10): Shygirl flawlessly executing Eurodance is not something I knew I needed, but am eternally grateful for.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The 9 PM sample is pure brilliance.

**fairytalehigh** (10): I'm a slut and also a slut for Greek mythology so this works on two levels

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): these bitches want what she has here

**iniekcja\_** (10): the eurodance sample is pure excellence

**pat-rickstar** (10): My life goal is to blast this song while driving on a highway at night

**ReallyCreative** (10): this came on shuffle as I was walking back to the metro station from a recent (vaccinated) dick appointment and I felt my bussy regenerate in real time

**richard#0420** (10): I hope they play this club banger at my funeral

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i love the production a lot

**twat\_brained** (10): oh bitch I am SOOOOO suggesting this for my next underground rave

**KennyEarthman** (9.5): total bop, but I wish it ended early instead of being repetitive

**relibee2** (9.5): MORE genre fusion I love

**akanewasright** (9): This feels like a decomposed version of something my gym teachers would play during PE in elementary school. This is, of course, the highest possible compliment I could give

**bbfan132** (9): enjoying the siren theme and the trance sound a lot

**cremeebrulee** (9): hypnotic (as a song with this title should be)

**fallenriot** (9): the pitched-up/distorted vocals on here are so nice

**intheaftermath** (9): this is like Oblivion but without the billionaire capitalism!!!

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): wasn't expecting some euro dance influence but im living for it

**seanderlust** (8.5): between "siren on the rocks" here and "narcissus" by roisin murphy, Greek lit gays are getting FED this month.

**sssaaage** (8.5): ended sunmi

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Really fitting closer to the EP, just absolutely phenomenal production again.

**Awkward\_King** (8): mermaids!!

**frogaranaman** (8): god this would go so fucking hard in a DJ set

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this does bop but I feel like it’s missing something from excellence

**lIIustration** (8): this has really good production but the lyrics again say nothing. this feels like a school presentation.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): the little instrumental break is great

**runaway3212** (8): I like this a lot for this album

**Stryxen** (8): this is so cinematic i will get this to play at the next party i go to until someones like what the hell is this turn it off :yawn:

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.6): It's cool.

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): In Greek mythology, the Sirens (Ancient Greek: singular: Σειρήν, Seirḗn; plural: Σειρῆνες, Seirênes) were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. It is also said that they can even charm the winds.

**1998tweety** (7): ok this bops a bit

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Siren? Like a mermaid?

**angryparadisecupcake** (7): giving me very europop but also rihanna vibes

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I could go for a siren on the rocks right now.

**hepmeucsb** (6): Eh, again it’s not bad, but I don’t love the EDM-ish beat drop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): feel like this one is too similar to BAWDY but then the chorus drop came and i was like ooo

**wavingwolves** (6): what's up with this eurodance moment...

**musical\_pyn** (5): I was expecting something bigger than this to close the ep but yeah, this is fine

**Vultuxe** (5): The only miss on the album for me, I don't like the instrumental break at all but at least this song has substance like TWELVE.

**waluigiest** (5): it’s not bad but it’s shapeless

**Mudkip1** (10): the ending to this is a SERVE!!! a true wig snatching achievement. the chorus sounds a bit stale (and cringy, ngl) after hearing it so many times; however, i enjoy the song as a whole, most notably the production. he adds all of these cool backing vocals and other vocal effects that add so many layers while listening. there’s a cool section in the pre-outro where it’s very quiet but you can just barely hear Troye humming in a higher register that I love so much.

**kappyko** (6): A brooding mood piece and the lead single to the project, "Take Yourself Home" is a lovely introduction to the IN A DREAM era: a gentle tune that maintains the EDM thorough-line throughout Troye's work yet uses it as a truly atmospherically rich background to Troye's matured writing. The moment the bizarre breakdown at the end occurs is the exact moment I knew I would like this project.

---

**lagozzino** (11): Best song of Troye's whole career

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Troye’s vocals and writing ability is everything

**akanewasright** (10): This song sounds like being dead inside... but in a good way. Except for the outro, that just sounds perfect

**Awkward\_King** (10): i absolutely adore how airy this feels, it feels like the song has room to exhale if that makes sense. the hook of "i'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me, if we're gonna die let's die somewhere pretty oh" is one of my favourite lines of last year, and honestly im a huge fan of the breakdown at the end, it doesnt feel like it's jumping the shark to me

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): When this came out I was kinda excited for Troye's upcoming project, because it was the third song of his (following My My My! and Dance To This) that I actually liked. The number hasn't changed since.

**fallenriot** (10): i love the breakdown at the end

**frogaranaman** (10): this outro is fucking WILD

**ManofOranges** (10): Me to myself when I'm about to drive home

**Misentro** (10): Click 3.0

**nowqueenofpop** (10): Something about this song had such a grip on me over the winter… nothing quite like a despondent, almost hopeless anthem when the sun goes down at 4:30pm… I know everyone likes the dance break at the end, I kinda don’t but I do appreciate what it adds to the song overall

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I didn't love this track at first, but over time I've really grown to appreciate the moody vibes

**relibee2** (10): this is just for that insane breakdown at the end holy shit

**richard#0420** (10): the drop.....

**skargardin** (10): more of this pretty please

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): another strong 11 contender. i love the haunting, moody vibe to this.

**TiltControls** (10): the drop at the end takes me out of the song tbh. would have been a good 11 otherwise too

**waluigiest** (10): honestly this moody suburban chic is right in Troye’s pocket. And the breakdown in the outro???? That is excellence right there

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): the breakdown at the end... wig

**celladonn** (9.5): A major slow burn grower for me

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): This song is about a night out ending alone, and finding some peace in that. That happened much more when "nights out" were I thing that I did. Also that outro fucking goesssssss

**NFLfreak98** (9.5): I think I’ll just make it official that whenever I feel like listening to There Is A Light That Never Goes Out I’ll just listen to this instead

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This just reminds me of early lockdown last year, but it still slaps so I'm ok with it

**yatcho** (9.5): sonically his most interesting song. Grew on me a lot over time and one of the few i come back to in this EP

**CrimsonROSET** (9): well we can’t all die somewhere pretty troye think about the people that live in ugly places

**hikkaru** (9): the outro is so good

**iniekcja\_** (9): a really good opener, the synths are lovely

**musical\_pyn** (9): this intro and outro are incredible, the middle isn't quite there though

**Roxieloxie** (9): i love one directions second album take me home stream now on spotify

**seanderlust** (9): "i'm tired of the city/scream if you're with me/if we're gonna die let's die somewhere pretty" i love these opening lines

**vayyiqra** (9): A full mood, as the kids say. I am tired of this city! I want to be free to travel wherever I want! Also, that outro bangs. I raised my score a whole point just for that.

**Vultuxe** (9): This is SO good but the breach into hyperpop at the end was not necessary.

**1998tweety** (8.5): i didnt like it at first but it grew

**plastichaxan** (8.5): i'll admit i'm not the biggest troye fan, i like his music and it's usually not for me, but hearing this makes me realize how much potential for better music he has

**cremeebrulee** (8): i want more of that outro

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I wasn't a fan of this song at first when it was released last year. But I think I like this now as an opener of the EP. I have a feeling this will grow on me so I am giving this an 8. Troye definitely showed his maturity here in this song.

**hepmeucsb** (8): Just a really well-constructed song that showcases where Troye could go for his next project.

**jasannn** (8): Lady Bird needs to do more Charli XCX outros.

**KennyEarthman** (8): this song is such a vibe. the outro really switches it up - can't say if that's good or bad.

**lIIustration** (8): smooothhhhh

**twat\_brained** (7.7): but Troye there's no Lyft that comes to this area and who the hell is coming out here during the curfew I don't wanna go home

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is super chill and vibey I just wish it went somewhere more

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.5): that bit at the end is chef's kiss

**runaway3212** (7.5): it's a bit incosistent but it's good

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): didn't like this at first but its grown on me, it's deceptively catchy

**bbfan132** (7): the last 30 seconds are pretty great, everything else is decent but nothing too special

**ReallyCreative** (7): a bit dull but some bright moments, not really something I'm super into but nothing egregious about it

**SmileandTears** (7): It's a vibe(?), i think?

**wryn\_** (7): the outro is good but i still think its misplaced

**anothertown** (6.5): sighs deeply

**NotWith10000Men** (6.3): it's… fine

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.2): its ok i guess, gets very white Australian towards the end

**ImADudeDuh** (6): help, i was listening to this with headphones and thought i could hear me moving in the headphones, but it was just a really quiet thing in the background

**LuisEnRod** (6): for that ending

**thedoctordances1940** (6): There are some really good ideas here but some of the instrumentals don't really match and I don't think his laid back vocals work that well here, but it's still a decent track. Well except those last 45 seconds, there's no defending that, completely unnecessary and really annoying breakdown.

**intheaftermath** (5): I do not like that percussion

**J\_Toe** (5): a little too slow and wistful for what I like listening to

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (4): A great song absolutely ruined by its last minute.

**wavingwolves** (4): how i'm sleeping now

**Stryxen** (3.5): i don’t want to wait 3 minutes to get to the only interesting part

**Mudkip1** (8): i don’t get why this track makes sum of yall so pressed??? lol is it because of how safe the production, writing, and overall atmosphere is? sjndkfjvndslkfv. i think Easy has a much better chorus/hook compared to Take Yourself Home though. i specifically love the one submitter who gave this track a 0 and left the comment ‘it’s ok i guess’

---

**thedoctordances1940** (11): I was sleeping on this song for far far too long. Before doing this rate I had already listened to this EP a lot as I quite like it but I'm guessing I just never listened well enough as I would've never considered this song anywhere close to being on par with In a Dream but it absolutely is, in fact it's even better. The chorus is perfect. And I mean PERFECT. You can feel the sadness in his voice, augmented by the little hints of autotune and the smoother more laid back vocals absolutely sell the sadness, the chorus has me damn near in tears. But then comes the post-chorus. "He made it easy". It's nothing complex, it's literally just 4 simple words, but they evoke so much emotion. I've never even felt quite like that about anybody, but it still absolutely wrecks me.

**Vromega** (11): One of my fave song from 2020. It has a lot of great elements : a lovely chorus, a fantastic bridge, and overall wholesome vibes. Each time I listen to Easy, this song hugs me when I need it. For the anecdote I discovered this EP and especially this song thanks to Masked Popheads and an iconic performance from the clown.

**1998tweety** (10): remix outsold but this is still very good

**akanewasright** (10): Thank God for Max Martin telling Troye and Oscar Holter to keep this song on the EP. I love it when autotune is used as shorthand for emotional distraught, and this song does that perfectly.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I'm pissed that I didn't listen to this earlier. I only heard it when the Kacey remix came out and forgot about it but this is INCREDIBLE

**CrimsonROSET** (10): WOO

**frogaranaman** (10): that music video is honestly stunning and so is the song

**hepmeucsb** (10): this house is on fire….WOOH

**jasannn** (10): An easy 10.

**ManofOranges** (10): "What's the opposite of hard?"

**NFLfreak98** (10): I’m not convinced synths have ever sounded better than in this song

**nootnoot781** (10): call me insane but i feel like the album art makes this song sound better.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This version > Remix, it just works better as a solo track

**richard#0420** (10): why did they try to remix this lol

**rickikardashian** (10): **WOO!**

**Roxieloxie** (10): is it easier to stay is it easier to go i dont know oh

**runaway3212** (10): I wish this EP had more songs like this

**TiltControls** (10): best song on the album, and one of the best in troye's discog!

**twat\_brained** (10): reminds me of ava Max's born to the night which means it's good

**wavingwolves** (10): this is great which is something i can't about any of the other songs in this ep

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): Troye killed it

**SmileandTears** (9.5): The Kacey remix outsold and it's not even close but I still really like this

**endcreditouilles** (9): The Kacey remix would have made it a 10 for me, I feel like it elevated the track to it's full potential and gave it the extra energy it needed. But it's still a gem by itself.

**lIIustration** (9): I really enjoy the horns section

**Misentro** (9): Liminal songs. Having heard the Kacey version, now I miss her on it

**sirpancakeXI** (9): i like the remix version better but this is not bad either

**skargardin** (9): jam

**slimboyfriend** (9): wow...... he sad

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i can't unhear "the stranger butthole"

**yatcho** (9): super cute

**seanderlust** (8.8): britneyspearssayingeasy.mp4

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I like the groove on this one but the weaknesses of Troye’s vocals are really apparent here

**musical\_pyn** (8.5): the kacey musgraves remix would probably get an 11

**astrologicalangel** (8): I prefer the version with Kacey Musgraves but this is good too

**Awkward\_King** (8): this song is quite special to me, on a very hot and stressful summers night last year i sat on a train and hyperventilated and had a very drawn out panic attack to it <3 and now no matter how good it is <3 it's tainted <3 bop tho

**cremeebrulee** (8): [stale topic] remix outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the remix outsold easily and would be an 11 contender. It’s still good though

**NotWith10000Men** (8): the first line of the chorus is like CRACK

**ReallyCreative** (8): While I like this one, I'm not a huge fan of the auto-tune effects on the chorus, just doesn't feel appropriate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): great song but i prefer the remix slightly more

**Vultuxe** (8): I liked it, the woofing during the chorus is a bit comical though.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): i’ve really tried to stan this but it just never hits right for me.

**izeasklapaucius** (7.5): okay i don't really mind if artists use autotune but i think the chorus overdid it. Still love the song though and the "flute" solo is really nice. We could use more flute solo on pop songs that aren't released by Lizzo or Björk.

**EnCaine** (7.3): extra points just for this house is on fire, woo!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Production could’ve been better

**bbfan132** (7): i think it’s pretty good - i like the concept/idea but the production falls flat in certain places

**celladonn** (7): The Mark Ronson/Kacey Musgraves version is a 10 but this can't help but feel a bit flat in comparison

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Synthwave revival should have ended with Blinding Lights.

**fallenriot** (7): kinda forgettable

**hikkaru** (7): love the remix w mark ronson and kacey but this version is a bit meh imo

**KennyEarthman** (7): this would play in the credits of a teen movie

**waluigiest** (7): The writing and melodies of the verses are so beautiful but I HATE the chorus. I think the autotune was such a weird artistic choice, and some of it really feels like a bad impression of Blinding Lights. Kacey remix is a 9.

**wryn\_** (7): this is so cute i am in love with him

**plastichaxan** (6): outsold by it’s own remix i fear

**Stryxen** (6): this is not easy to listen to

**twat\_brained** (10): no no, I don't think you understand... I'm OBSESSED.

**dcampb97** (9.7): she's spilling

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): a plant-eating insect with long hind legs that are used for jumping and for producing a chirping sound. It frequents grassy places and low vegetation.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Yet another tkay banger, she just doesn't miss.

**EnCaine** (9.2): fucking 🍞🔥

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): look at how she ate that

**fairytalehigh** (9): The caterpillar/butterfly imagery with just how dark and heavy this is. In a car? that bass rocks.

**fallenriot** (9): her flow on this one is so good

**hepmeucsb** (9): These industrial-influenced beats get me everytime, and Tkay’s vocals are so powerful

**NotWith10000Men** (7): guitar is nice. I love the "fourth of july" part, and that whole verse

**wryn\_** (6.5): annoying that its sequenced right next to a much better take on industrial trap cause it makes this seem a lot flatter in comparison

**anothertown** (6): this type of distorted crunchy beat has gone so rancid imo

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I thought that this song would be about the insect and I’m disappointed that it’s not

**musical\_pyn** (6): something about the production here is a little off but the song's still good

**kappyko**: i begged mud to include fletcher in some capacity even though we both agreed she’s kind of super boring. this was the cute song we agreed on

---

**KennyEarthman** (10): I started dancing before I realized it

**richard#0420** (10): this poor girl deserves a smash

**sarcasticsobs** (10): god i’m so alone

**skargardin** (10): stream the s(ex) tapes!!

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): Can't wait for when I can suck dick in a dark room while this song blasts in the distance

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (9): This production is a little annoying but this does go off.

**jasannn** (9): The production on the songs I've heard from her are incredible

**ReallyCreative** (9): wasn't sure at first but it evolved into quite the bop

**twat\_brained** (9): okay the Fletcher hype is real gays are truly winning with her

**vayyiqra** (9): A bop ! I need to listen to her more.

**outsideeyess** (8.1): def not the best song on this EP

**akanewasright** (8): the bass... take my energy ugh

**fallenriot** (8): the beat drops are pretty good!

**frogaranaman** (8): DO NOT SLEEP ON FLETCHER

**TiltControls** (8): I liked you ruined new york, and loved Finding Fletcher, but nothing from s(ex) tapes has caught me the same yet. Still Fletcher's insanely talented and underrated

**EnCaine** (7.5): this is good

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): I lowkey wanted to hate it but I don't

**angryparadisecupcake** (7): i’m not trying to be rude but i think other songs from her did the same but better, am i making sense? i don’t think i’m making sense

**bbfan132** (7): pretty fun song

**Roxieloxie** (7): https://open.spotify.com/album/66xYgdQtwsRz9L4p6JgcLI

**Stryxen** (7): smooth but it could do a bit more

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.2): Instrumental's a little bit interesting

**celladonn** (6): this kind of just sounds like radio filler to me

**cremeebrulee** (6): bitter (even with the tumblr-esque lyrics) outsold

**jayjaysortagay** (6): production is a 10, lyrics are a 0. "the one right now" might be worse than the "Mr right now" cliché. If I Hated You outsold

**plastichaxan** (6): pretty forgettable

**hepmeucsb** (4): Sorry, this falls into generic “Spotify playlist” music for me. The beat isn’t bad, but queen please do more with your vocals.

**Vultuxe** (4): Seems really, really generic, didn't stick out to me much at all. Unfortunately even her voice sounds generic to me I doubt this song could be something even if it tried. The pauses in production got tired immediately. The bridge is not bad though.

**wavingwolves** (3): not crazy about this

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i really hate this production so much that i gave this a q for it’s score and didnt notice until i was about to send my scores

**Brendon-Urine** (10): insane effects on Justin's voice

**fallenriot** (10): this is fucking amazing

**steelstepladder** (8.5): Shame this isn't as good as literally anything on Good at Falling

**hepmeucsb** (8): Huh, I really liked this song, but Justin Vernon’s vocals do make me miss his old falsetto on FEFA and Self-titled.

**skargardin** (8): this is a lot but in a good way

**Stryxen** (7.8): it just goes through me a bit but in a lovely and sweet way stream be sweet by japanese breakfast

**EnCaine** (7.7): this is good

**vayyiqra** (7): The Japanese House feat. Japanese Breakfast feat. Beach House feat. Justin Vernon (The White Man Bon Iver) feat. Taylor Swift - "Exile".

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I have no beef with this girl’s music but it does bug me that a white girl would release music under the moniker “The Japanese House” partially because it means I always mix her up with Japanese Breakfast (another artist who makes similar music) and because like… you’re a white British girl lol, change your name. This goes for you to Asian Doll. Also we should have included [Bumper - Pop Songs 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfDRUI2JsA)

**angryparadisecupcake** (5): nothing justin vernon will ever do will measure up to 715 – CRΣΣKS that is the creeks for us mere mortals

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): This is just a crunchified melody, not digging it.

**richard#0420** (5): snoozer

**Mudkip1** (9): this track is so INTENSE!!! but i VIBE!!! screaming the chorus for no fuckin reason is so fucking FUN!! i think this lingered in the top 10 for a while but ended up landing just a little lower. i was worried this EP would come off as a bit too harsh for the ears of /r/popheads but it seems like you’re all mostly here for it!

---

**CallMeIsmail\_** (11): typing this at 1:30am

**izeasklapaucius** (11): peggy main pop girl omg. But seriously, one of the most underrated collabs of the past few years.

**steelstepladder** (11): This is my only opportunity to give Peggy an 11 isn't it?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The production doesn’t miss on this album

**akanewasright** (10): another *serve* of a potential win, even though it seems less likely than shook

**bbfan132** (10): banger UGH, peggy is great here

**celladonn** (10): Big insomniac mood. The beat goes so hard, as does Peggy's verse

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Peggers.

**frogaranaman** (10): this probably will get shit on by the sub but man this is so fucking good

**hepmeucsb** (10): This beat is FILTHY I did NOT expect this!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is so good ugh... I love the the little cell ring throughout the song and the beat goes so hard

**iniekcja\_** (10): he deserves to get his ass ate for this one

**jayjaysortagay** (10): Tia Tamera walked so Awake could run

**pat-rickstar** (10): I turn straight when JPEGMAFIA's verse comes on, only time you'll hear me rapping about pussy

**plastichaxan** (10): JPEG complements her so well and the production is insane

**Roxieloxie** (10): /u/awkward_king

**seanderlust** (10): this goes so hard

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Streaming this song while having insomnia is an experience.

**skargardin** (10): LATE NIGHT PROLLY AWAKE

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a v strong contender for my 11, this song has had insane replay ability for me.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This is one of those songs that I instantly fell in love with. The industrial beat is just so goddamn fucking great, Tkay's verse is amazing, Peggy absolutely kills his guest verse and the chorus is ridiculously catchy. Could easily stay awake all night listening to this banger.

**EnCaine** (9.5): queen of after hours availability, i love peggy

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): this is like Shook (slowed down witch remix) (Tkaylor's Version) and I'm not mad about it

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): This song is made to blast in a car with the windows down, the bass just goes soo hard. Also Peggy is a natural partner for Tkay

**cremeebrulee** (9): i want this song to beat me up

**endcreditouilles** (9): Just not feeling JPEGMAFIA's verse, otherwise this would have been a 10 for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i should probably hate this but this song is great

**richard#0420** (9): such a dangerous duo together, they could make an entire EP

**Stryxen** (9): their voices are both so satisfying and the way they ate this beat up… the excellence

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): stan peggy

**vayyiqra** (9): "[A] song all about late night antics and having ADHD". Relatable banger!

**relibee2** (8.9): this is so chaotic I fucking love it.

**wavingwolves** (8.8): omfg i have insomnia!!!! fuck!!! this song is just like me

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): A win for the insomnia community

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I love you girl but are you really still using FaceTime?

**twat\_brained** (7.7): why is jpeg trying to sound like Kendrick? This isn't saving the song for me; it goes hard absolutely but this doesn't really feel like tkay's territory yet

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): pretty similar to shook. I appreciate the more abrasive production tho

**wryn\_** (7.5): her parts are just ranting about her insomnia and then peggy shows up and kills like 10 people in one verse. rager

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The JPEGMAFIA verse low-key serves

**musical\_pyn** (7): oooh this chemsitry is nice

**CritneySpearz** (6.5): this is simultaneously one of the most annoying yet catchy songs on this EP...

**jasannn** (6.5): Not my type of music but I would enjoy this a lot at college party drunk af.

**Vultuxe** (6.5): Okay, these songs are REALLY repetitive and sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses.

**lIIustration** (6): not huge on the outro

**runaway3212** (6): a bit messy

**waluigiest** (6): I want to like this song but it stresses me out.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): This is really obnoxious, droning and annoying

**Awkward\_King** (5): me at 4am for no reason

**NotWith10000Men** (5): just not my style of rap. But I do like the more melodic part near the end

**Misentro** (1): This was hard to get through

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Love this song but I’m glad that we didn’t rate this EP in full because it’s not that great, most of the songs on it felt unfinished. I like Keke’s music though and the second part of the EP was much better. Also we should have included [Wolftyla - Wolf In Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqC_-yzFxxE)

**LuisEnRod** (9): bop bop bop

**outsideeyess** (9): not close to the best song on VT1 but Keke deserves so...

**richard#0420** (9): excellent

**akanewasright** (8.5): ~~the low synth here UGH it’s so good~~ upon further reflection, my comment is now “Baby this is Keke Palmer”

**fallenriot** (8): someone count how many of these comments mention the metro train or say “baby that’s keke palmer”

**KennyEarthman** (8): I love the synths on the chorus

**skargardin** (8): a banger

**vayyiqra** (8): This is good ! Maybe I should check out more of her music.

**wavingwolves** (8): this sounds like a kpop bside which is a compliment

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): Excuse me ma’am, not to be disrespectful or rude but could you please take post down. That is my sister who was killed by a metra train. And it this post is very disrespectful. Idk who you are or if you even know her but I need you to take this down please.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Excuse me ma'am, not to be disrespectful or rude but could you please take this rate down. This is my sister who was killed by catching a dream. And this rate is very disrespectful. Idk who you are or if you even know her but I need you to take this down please.

**iniekcja\_** (7): metra train this metra train that

**jayjaysortagay** (7): Baby, this is Keke Palmer

**whatsanillinois** (7): what if instead of "fuck it up" she said "pick it up" and then the song was ska

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): Excuse me not to be disrespectful or rude but could you please take this post down. That is my sister who was killed by a metra train. And it this post is very disrespectful. idk who u are or if u even know her but i need you to take this down please.

**EnCaine** (6.7): this is pretty okay

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s a pretty song but doesn’t fully come together for me

**frogaranaman** (6): I’m a virgo too

**hepmeucsb** (6): Not bad, but probably not something I would seek out. Her voice is nice.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (5.5): Does nothing. It's not really a 'zero' per se, but it is the worst song here and, well, I had to use it somewhere.

**angryparadisecupcake** (5): maybe stick to acting

**Brendon-Urine** (5): i normally love these kinds of pulsating dance beats but this was mid

**jasannn** (5): Im not a fan of her voice here. It makes the song sound even more flat and generic.

**Mudkip1** (8): SO shocked by how high this song got! it seemed to slowly climb higher and higher as more scores came in, too, even surpassing half the other songs in her EP. the flow is so wonky and relaxing, making it a great way to close off the EP.

---

**anothertown** (10): HOT!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Her voice is STUNNING, honestly, what can't she do?!

**lIIustration** (10): telemarketer anthem

**plastichaxan** (10): this song hits a bit close my fav on this project for sure

**ReallyCreative** (10): me to Heather from Account Services regarding my vehicle's extended warranty

**richard#0420** (10): Kari and her have perfect chemistry together

**runaway3212** (10): A great closer!

**Stryxen** (10): hits different on repeat when the intro plays and you realise how much she does in this

**treecoh** (10): this is so ridiculously good

**1998tweety** (9.5): bop

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i feel like this would work really well with raveena too, its so smooth and silky

**jasannn** (9.5): Late night drive vibes.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (9.3): Great closer.

**Roxieloxie** (9.3): : an act of using the telephone : an act of calling someone on the telephone. : an act of calling with the voice : a loud cry or shout.

**relibee2** (9.2): nice lil slow jam

**bbfan132** (9): really endearing outro!!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this one goes out to all bitches named antoinette

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is completely unrelated to the song but yesterday I had to explain to a customer on the phone how “faux” is pronounced because he kept asking me for “fox fur” and got upset when I offered him “foam fur.” Anyways if one of the sub’s b-tier pop girls had released this it would be a treasured deep cut

**iniekcja\_** (9): there's something about album closers featuring Kari Faux

**pat-rickstar** (9): Yet another great song, Kari's feature is excellent

**skargardin** (9): such a dreamy vibe to end the ep with, I love it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): always forget how much i enjoy this song

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The perfect end to such a phenomenal EP, and a really great guest verse. The range that Tkay displays on this EP is nothing short of astounding, I'm so excited about where she goes from here.

**twat\_brained** (9): I remember during her AMA tkay told me this was her favorite song to record, and I can understand why, it's quite smooth, and she and Kari have excellent chemistry

**waluigiest** (9): one of my college roommates loved Kari Foux so I feel really acquainted with Lost En Los Angeles (especially Fantasy)

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): Love the energy here, that funk guitar is delicious

**nowqueenofpop** (8.5): Now this is a CLOSER!!

**seanderlust** (8.5): dreamy and floaty. i love this

**EnCaine** (8.2): i read that as karl marx

**AHSWeeknd** (8): A great closer

**musical\_pyn** (8): great closer and great feature

**NotWith10000Men** (8): that GROOVE. Stank face

**wavingwolves** (8): me when i get a spam call from a number from another state for the tenth time in one day

**frogaranaman** (7): good closer

**hepmeucsb** (7): This is my favorite of the vibey songs from the EP

**KennyEarthman** (7): it's ok for a closer

**wryn\_** (7): two very cool performances here

**vayyiqra** (6): Something about this doesn't quite work. The bass is rather noisy and not in a good way. It still has a nice groove though!

**Vultuxe** (6): It felt a bit like a generic RnB song with a chill rap feature, idk. Didn't hate it but wouldn't want to hear it again.
