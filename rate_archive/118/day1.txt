deleted: I'm not sure whether I'm more pro-tkay and pro-shygirl or anti-Troye... We'll see how my mood shifts over the night :)

I'm also kind of more invested in the bonus rate, because Good Things, Natalie Don't and Crown are all amazing and should win in a three-way tie.

**[All scores](https://paste.ee/p/x9ugE#hTH8TgL1gO9bJ8RBUu1oxKtZOak1P2zb)**

---

**kappyko** (7): Is anyone surprised? It's practically, if not entirely, an interlude - let alone an ACOUSTIC BALLAD WITH HIS VOCALS IN THE BACKGROUND. But it's still so pretty! Almost Punisher adjacent - don't forget to do the Pitchfork rate!

**Mudkip1** (6): i don’t really have much to say about this except that i just really admire Roxie for giving this her 11. queen behavior

---

**Roxieloxie** (11): I actually really love this song :(( its gonna go out day one but Ive been really sad lately and this its really nice. it conveys the feeling I had summer 2019 perfectly in a way i cant describe. it feels all consuming and just like a flush of emotions.

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): extremely good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the TRUE interludephobia is making the best song on your EP an interlude

**mysario** (10): best song in the rate too bad it's going out 30th

**rickikardashian** (10): release an extended version pussy

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): Ooof, this one hurts

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): we were in fact robbed of this being a full length song, but i still love it as an interlude, it is so dreamy and kind of drunk in its presentation, and i love the way the drum kicks in.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Jesus Christ, this is such a sad song. 😭

**richard#0420** (8.5): indie king

**seanderlust** (8.5): aw I want to hear more

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): He brought me to tears with Easy, then said MORE

**fallenriot** (8): a nice interlude, the vocal reverb works really well

**hepmeucsb** (8): This interlude is going to flop, but I still love it

**jasannn** (8): Cute interlude

**ManofOranges** (8): Me when I'm thinking about any man who's ever been nice to me

**musical\_pyn** (8): I love this and wanted so much more

**relibee2** (8): honestly should’ve been a whole ass song on its own.

**SmileandTears** (8): pretty

**waluigiest** (8): wtf I really liked it and then it ended.

**TiltControls** (7.5): uh where'd the rest of the song go??? It sounds good

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): cute interlude

**kirby31200** (7): Eventual victim of balladphobia

**nootnoot781** (7): fuck troye for making this 52s

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): there is the potential for a really good song if it was longer

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this has "Target Exclusive Voice Memo" energy

**Vromega** (7): Humm it's good but what's the point honestly ??? 52s, this is trolling

**Vultuxe** (7): HATE the song title but song is not bad.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): Cute, but in a rate this competitive It has to get a low score from me

**twat\_brained** (6.5): I'm about to cry too but that's because it's 2 am and I got face wash in my eyes this afternoon and it's been harsh on my eyes ever since we are not the same Mr Sivan

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.1): does nothing wrong

**bbfan132** (6): it’s pretty but it feels like an interlude

**CrimsonROSET** (6): interludephobia strikes again but this time in an ep? Its already short troysivan

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Cute for an interlude.

**lIIustration** (6): meh

**runaway3212** (6): A bit forgettable

**wryn\_** (6): cute lil bedroom pop moment

**EnCaine** (5.7): okay

**cremeebrulee** (5): an interlude? in my EP rate?

**frogaranaman** (5): interludephobia

**KennyEarthman** (5): it's an interlude I guess

**NotWith10000Men** (5): truly no thoughts about this

**pat-rickstar** (5): Interludephobia… this sounds ok but I don’t think it's really needed

**raicicle** (5): this is fine

**static\_int\_husp** (5): even on EPs must must suffer the terrorism of interludes

**bulforster** (4.9): I think I'd like this if it was a full song but in this form it's just extremely unsatisfying.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): INTERLUDEPHOBIA!! Turn the mic up or something

**angryparadisecupcake** (4): this song literally goes nowhere, go girl give us nothing teas, i know it’s just like 52 seconds but that’s no excuse look what lana managed to do in don’t call me angel

**intheaftermath** (4): it is so muddy and I am thankful it was only a few seconds

**jayjaysortagay** (4): society has progressed passed the need for vocal interludes that are just lazily formed half-songs.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): it sure is an interlude

**thedoctordances1940** (4): this exists I guess

**akanewasright** (3): This is cute? And I never skip it when listening to the EP? But like... I believe in interludephobia after the BCC rate.

**ReallyCreative** (3): I'm not trying to be interludephobic but I didn't get this one, it doesn't connect the two songs well, it doesn't really say anything interesting, and its a concept that probably could have been a full song? A good interlude this does not make.

**skargardin** (3): you're not fooling anyone into thinking this is a full song Troye

**Stryxen** (2): yawn emoji!

**wavingwolves** (2): why is this even here in the first place... can't imagine...

**ignitethephoenix** (0): girl what was this is this even a song

**LesApfels** (0): I never even realized this started playing after Easy

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (0): I feel like I'm wasting my 0 using it here, but fuck it, it is what this dumb interlude deserves.

McIgglyTuffMuffin: If I hadn't used my zero it probably honestly would have gotten a 5 or 6, like there is something good there but my man was like, nah you're only gonna get 52 seconds. I thought it was so dumb and a waste of my time, so it deserved the zero. 

There was just nothing else in the rate that I felt deserved the big oh so it went there.

**Mudkip1** (9): i’ll admit that on future listens i’ve decided this track is more of a 7 than a 9. but oh well, it seems everyone else felt a lot worse about it! his vocals have an echo effect that makes it sound like he recorded this in his bathroom lol. all that being said, the subdued strings and plucking guitar give 10/10 a very sweet, innocent aesthetic that i find quite charming.

**kappyko** (8): Sorry, Troye! Looks like you can't just manifest that kind of average. But this bonus track to IN A DREAM is actually, in my opinion, one of its best! His ballads are sorely underrated, and the lo-fi quality to his qualities lends this a homespun quality that I've sorely missed in my bedroom pop. The aquatic qualities of the production almost sound like something off of A Moon Shaped Pool, which is always a plus in my book. And yet the starkness takes me back to the minimalism of Blonde... ugh, bonus track phobia won't ever end, will it?

---

**1998tweety** (10): this song is a 10/10

**akanewasright** (10): I’ve said this a few times, but this song will literally hurt me when it goes out. I first listened to the EP when it came out, but while I liked some of the songs (mostly the ones I already knew), I wound up turning it off before the last track. When I went back to it after this song was put on streaming, suddenly everything seemed to click more. As for the song itself... songs of hope when everything is obviously going to shit fucking break me, and I very much view this song as one of those, especially given the surrounding songs. It’s lovely, tender, and optimistic in the face of the inevitable end to this relationship. It’s a song I put on repeat when I’m having a bad day. This is and always has been my favorite on the EP. Hell, this would be an 11 contender if I didn’t know how much some people hate this record. Anyways... this is all to say that when this song goes out, I’m not going to be interacting in plug/kosmi/beatsense/whatever for a hot minute. This song is too close to my heart to handle people shitting on it.

**richard#0420** (10): across the board! Billie Porter voice

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the title spilled

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): everything before this was trying way too hard but this one is actually really cute

**TiltControls** (10): tens across the board!

**waluigiest** (10): it’s so…🥺

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): 10 out 10 song

**Awkward\_King** (9): this goes hand in hand with animal from bloom for me, tho animal is better this is still so :heart_flushed:! its just a love song, it makes me want love

**hepmeucsb** (9): A beautiful ballad that really puts the whole EP into perspective. It will undoubtedly fly under the radar in this rate.

**seanderlust** (9): so close, troye. but a 9 is still pretty good

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): I like this song, but it's not a 10/10 for me, sorry

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): ironically, this song isn't a 10, but it is very cute and a still a solid score none the less

**jasannn** (8): I better not see any balladphobia here.

**musical\_pyn** (8): wow this is so cute, I remember this being disliked but I can't see why??

**nootnoot781** (8): this is not a 10/10 it is an 8/10

**relibee2** (8): this is wholesome and cute I love :)

**skargardin** (8): this is great tbh

**SmileandTears** (8): cute

**twat\_brained** (7.8): this one sadly isn't that but still quite good

**celladonn** (7.5): not quite

**bbfan132** (7): cute song!!

**cremeebrulee** (7): sorry troye you can’t trick me into giving u a 10

**CrimsonROSET** (7): how many people are gonna make jokes about their scores in their comments

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): relatable content but unfortunately the song itself is not a 10/10

**ignitethephoenix** (7): he really screwed up my scrobbles just to add this track

**ManofOranges** (7): Not a 10, sorry troye!

**runaway3212** (7): pretty but boring

**vayyiqra** (7): Troye is so sad and insecure someone give him a hug seriously

**Vultuxe** (7): Reminds me of something... it's sweet though.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.2): I feel like the guitar line was wasted here.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): TIL this little EP had a bonus track on some editions

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I wonder how many people are gonna give this a ten

**astrologicalangel** (6): ironically, I can not give this a 10/10

**KennyEarthman** (6): I slept. guitar is so boring

**mysario** (6): silly Troye, you can't rate your own songs

**pat-rickstar** (6): I forgot this existed, it's cute actually and better than I remembered

**ReallyCreative** (6): more like 6/10

**frogaranaman** (5): ironic that this song isn’t a 10/10

**iniekcja\_** (5): that title is really overconfident

**steelstepladder** (5): You're trying to trick me with that title but I won't be fooled

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): first time listening to this and i don't think it adds anything to the EP tbh

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (4.1): sheesh. wish I could steal that beautiful production right before the bridge for a better song because that one part is godly

**NotWith10000Men** (3): is he singing into a fan in the bathroom?

**lIIustration** (1): i really dislike this because this sounds like background music for a mediocre coming of age movie that you don't want to watch but you can't leave the theater because you want to finish your popcorn and eating movie popcorn anywhere that's not the movies is just sad

**martian\_pet** (0): The song is not necesarily that bad but i had a zero to give so… i gave it to the song i liked the least

**thedoctordances1940** (0): Well this song definitely isn't a 10/10

**wavingwolves** (0): this title could not be more wrong

**kappyko** (8): [A sincere tribute to a woman and her child whom were both taken way too soon.](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-53742553) The inclusion of this song on the project is a beautiful moment, and Bree Runway using her platform as a pop star to offer this is touching. I understand the apprehension behind giving a numerical score to this, but I figure that it's important to make sure people listen to this anyways.

**Mudkip1** (6): i’ll let kappy’s comment do the talking here. it’s a lovely gesture but it’s also just an interlude so i’m not surprised this landed so low in the rate

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): why is this so short???

**jayjaysortagay** (10): I'm really glad she included this, it's really powerful

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Gorgeous and heartbreaking song, it's nice to hear a different side of Bree on this track, and I already know this is going to be robbed, because of both it's length AND being a ballad

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): this made me cry lol

**Awkward\_King** (9): this is a really touching interlude that i fear is going to get trodden on by people who dont know about nor care about the context which... makes me sad :(

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this minute long song had no business being this sad omg

**Vromega** (9): It's so good but why is it so shooort ?

**relibee2** (8.7): WHY ISNT THIS LONGER

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): It feels weird to give a score to this song when Bree wanted to dedicate this interlude to Nicole Thea, a friend of Bree, who unfortunately died in a heart attack that killed her and her unborn son. RIP Nicole Thea and Baby Reign.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this is a really interesting inclusion but shows to me that Bree is capable of making songs on harder hitting topics, it's short, but it's intriguing. I'd like to see more.

**richard#0420** (8.5): the PASSION in her voice

**runaway3212** (8.5): Too good to be this short

**plastichaxan** (8.3): when she makes a full length song like this it’ll be quite the cultural reset mark my words

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Is this an interlude? Should I be interludephobic?

**bbfan132** (8): only a bit over a minute long but it’s sad yet gorgeous

**cremeebrulee** (8): uhm i don’t think we should be rating this

**CrimsonROSET** (8): BUT WHY IS IT SO SHORT GIRL COME ON

**dcampb97** (8): kinda exists outside of the EP

**fairytalehigh** (8): I Too short? It never really felt like skit/interlude to me--kind of just unfinished? Idk. Would've like to see it more fleshed out

**fallenriot** (8): my only complaint with this song is that ITS WAY TOO SHORT

**KennyEarthman** (8): I'd give it a 10 if it was longer

**nootnoot781** (8): may they rest in power <3

**seanderlust** (8): god 24 is so young. RIP.

**EnCaine** (7.5): i never know how to score interludes/short songs but it's succeeding!

**lIIustration** (7.5): short and sweet but more sweet

**Brendon-Urine** (7): actually really nice for a short lil interlude, she's got a nice voice

**frogaranaman** (7): Nicole Thea & Baby Reign I better hear y’all make some noise!!!

**hepmeucsb** (7): Clearly meant to be a brief acknowledgement of people she dearly misses, so I appreciate it for what it is.

**intheaftermath** (7): I wish this was longer!!!!

**musical\_pyn** (7): I love this and wish it was longer

**waluigiest** (7): it’s simple but it’s touching

**Mudkip1** (9): kind of a cute closer to the EP but i guess i’m in the minority sndjhvknsldj

**kappyko** (6): Our first single out should... probably not be a surprise to anyone, in all honestly! It doesn't help that Magdalena Bay released nearly the entirety of *A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling* before its full-length release. "Oh Hell" is a low tempo cut that reminds me of Purity Ring, like, a lot! I've grown to appreciate it over time, especially Matthew's contribution that reminds me of Foster the People (there's a better comparison that isn't coming to mind right now) and at the time I write this I'm already wishing I had given this a higher score. But it isn't exactly much of a surprise that this goes out so early: an atmospheric, slow outro to a project otherwise full of dance-pop songs isn't going to go over well with some! Yet listening now I appreciate how gorgeously produced it is, and how it builds so effectively to the climactic "oh, hell!"

---

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): I love how good Mag Bay are at making visuals accompanying their songs that match the vibe of the track PERFECTLY, and this track is no exception to that, it makes ME want to dance to this song infront of a projector

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): They said "you can have one more bop to end the EP, as a treat"

**richard#0420** (9): cute lil’ closer, gives me Purity Ring vibes

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): A lot of times I prefer to hear my pop girls in solitude, but here the male vocal adds an intriguing wrinkle to the rest of the EP. I think it probably would've worked better in the middle of the EP than the finale though.

**yatcho** (8.5): really like the use of the male vocalist, they should use him

**twat\_brained** (8.2): come on, you had the chance to go for a smash outro! Why have a buildup to something if you're just going to stumble

**akanewasright** (8): The final chorus is just... so perfect

**angryparadisecupcake** (8): ???? feral

**bbfan132** (8): the guy kind of sounds like one of the guys from mgmt or phoenix or another one of those late 00s indie bands

**ReallyCreative** (8): me when someone asks where Ronald Reagan lives

**Roxieloxie** (8): In religion and folklore, Hell is an afterlife location in which evil souls are subjected to punitive suffering, often torture, as eternal punishment after death.

**runaway3212** (8): A good closer

**Vultuxe** (8): Okay, reading about the subject matter this is really creative topic to sing about. I have to stan.

**seanderlust** (7.7): i like that this feels half dreamy, half creepy

**Stryxen** (7.7): me when i realised where lil nas was pole dancing to

**jasannn** (7.5): Not my favorite on the EP but it has such a satisifying build up to the climax.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.3): avril lavigne after being good all her life

**AHSWeeknd** (7): what a nice closer to a nice little EP

**hepmeucsb** (7): It’s good, but not amazing

**KennyEarthman** (7): this song is such a vibe. cool closer

**wryn\_** (7): god they know how to end a song

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): the production outshines the singing here too much for me

**fallenriot** (6.5): i wish the guy sang the whole thing honestly, her vocals were not selling me here for some reason

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I literally forgot this song existed and I can kinda understand why but it is pretty

**TiltControls** (6.5): The one dull point on the ep. Not bad, but outshone by everything else

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.3): a bit of a snoozer at the end

**1998tweety** (6): meh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): what the fuck was that ‘drop’

**ImADudeDuh** (6): me when someone asks me where lil nas x went to in the call me by your name video, but it takes me a sec to remember

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Non-event.

**lIIustration** (5): this isn't doing anything for me

**musical\_pyn** (5): something about the mix here is off, but also I don't know if I would like the song more if it was fixed

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): the ethereal vibe is kind of cool

**frogaranaman** (4): it’s a cute outro but not really for me

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (4): This just feels like a cheap knock off of a CRJ song. But not a good one.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): wow this album went way downhill after the first two songs

**Brendon-Urine** (3): just bland. this EP really should have been trimmed honestly

**waluigiest** (2): boring lyrics, boring melody, boring orchestration

**Mudkip1** (10): this song being about men hitting on twelve year old girls was certainly a choice to start off the ep. i gave it a 10 purely because i think the production slaps

**kappyko** (5): Kinda funny how the intro to this project is pretty universally regarded as the weakest, and it doesn't help that the subject matter happens to be very, very uncomfortable for some! "TWELVE" was always at the bottom of the project's rankings, and its lack of hooks and claustrophobic mixing means that its audience was always going to be limited.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): one of the weirdest songs i've ever heard, in terms of blend between subject matter/lyrical content, the way the topic is tackled, and the production. but i heavily fuck with it.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm an acquired taste. You don't like me? Acquire some taste!

**richard#0420** (10): cue the mf’n strobe lights

**Vultuxe** (10): I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did?

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): Maybe I'm just dense but I still don't get why this song is called Twelve

**bbfan132** (9): love the trippy production

**fairytalehigh** (9): I'm sexually attracted to women now, I don't make the rules

**fallenriot** (9): such a good opener

**seanderlust** (9): oh this goes off. this is a hell of a way to open an EP - esp. with the lines about her mom and dad

**vayyiqra** (7): Oh right I forgot she is Bri" "ish

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): 12 (twelve) is the natural number following 11 and preceding 13. The product of the first 3 factorials, twelve is a superior highly composite number, divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6.

**iniekcja\_** (6.5): my least favorite on the ep but still good, might be the vocal mix

**wryn\_** (6.5): genuinely creepy shit

**akanewasright** (6): ...I don’t feel super comfortable with the subject matter. Like, it’s produced well, and I don’t think this is like... a moral issue or anything, it just skeeves me out a little. It’s produced really well though.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): ok first of all i want to say this EP cover has creeped me tf out. song is cool

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (5): To be fair, I'm biased against speaking segments in songs

**cremeebrulee** (5): ever since i found out this song is about underage girls, i’ve just been personally really uncomfortable with it sorry no shade, i love the rest of the EP

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5): I have literally no idea if I like this or not. I feel like both a zero or an eleven could even be appropriate here. So we're just gonna break even and go with the 5.

**Stryxen** (5): i like half of the things and dislike the other half

**SmileandTears** (4.5): I am.. creeped out

**jayjaysortagay** (4): the beat gives me supreme anxiety

**musical\_pyn** (4): oh no I'm not gonna like this ep am I

**1998tweety** (2): no i do not like this at all sorry, sounds like she is so bored and doesnt care at all

**KennyEarthman** (0): I hate this song for giving me a negative first impression of the album, like, wtf. I thought the album as a whole would sound like this. thankfully, it gets good. but I have a burning hatred for this track in particular

**lIIustration** (0): i really don't enjoy this in any way.

**kappyko** (8): Okay, come on, this rules! It's short and not as show-offish compared to Bree's most popular songs, but it shows off some of her best singing, clever lyrics, and I have to say that all gunshot percussion is more than welcome!

**Mudkip1** (4): very boring imo, i don’t care for the production and how it’s based around loading a gun and shooting it

---

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (11): I came into this rate assuming Damn Daniel or People, I've Been Sad would get my 11 but this one is just too good. "When we pull up it's offensive" is literally genius. Bree genuinely just emanates cool and this song shows it.

**NotWith10000Men** (11): oh SHIT this slapped me across the face

**richard#0420** (10): slapperooni

**Roxieloxie** (10): Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from purpose-built administrative and production facilities opened in 2003 across from the historic Goodwood Circuit in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom.

**waluigiest** (10): SING THAT SHIT BREE AHHHHHH there’s so much joy here

**wavingwolves** (9.2): bopping

**cremeebrulee** (9): ik people think this is a skip but i rly like this chill sort of song especially after 4 bangers in a row

**CrimsonROSET** (9): are rolls royces even sign of money anymore? like who cares for watches just look at the time on your phone

**EnCaine** (9): queen of luxury cars

**fairytalehigh** (9): Great example of how Bree toes the line between rap and pop. Got a Britney shoutout, a Cher allusion AND it goes hard as fuck, we stan, we stan

**fallenriot** (9): a smooth bop, i’ll just pretend i don’t think rolls royces are hideous

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): the Britney line took me ooooout lmao

**celladonn** (8.5): very catchy and I'm always a sucker for gun sound effects in songs, which this has in abundance

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I will never own one but good on you Bree

**runaway3212** (8.5): understated but great

**angryparadisecupcake** (8): oh this surprised me tbh, the beat is good and she has a really nice flowy delivery, this could sound in a teen movie while the regina-george-but-actually-indie character struts round the hallway

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Go off kween!!!!

**skargardin** (8): banger

**twat\_brained** (7.8): this EP had such great momentum don't slow down now Bree sis!

**kirby31200** (7.5): Would've been great without the stock gunshot sfx

**1998tweety** (7): this bops (the n-word hard r caught me off guard tho)

**AHSWeeknd** (7): this really followed Damn Daniel

**bbfan132** (7): a little one-note but it’s still good

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Kind of tepid compared to the 1-2-3-4 smashes preceding it.

**hepmeucsb** (7): It’s pretty good, a little lowkey

**izeasklapaucius** (7): you'll be humming the chorus way lot more than you should have

**Misentro** (7): RRRRRRRRRRRR

**musical\_pyn** (7): this chill vibe kinda works, but it's not bree at her best

**pat-rickstar** (7): It's cute but I don’t really listen to it outside of the playing the mixtape in full

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6.8): i can't drive

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.5): eh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): it's fine but after the amazing first four songs its a bit of a non-event

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): Just a little bit forgettable but definitely not bad

**bluehxrizon** (6): this is what ariana was trying to do with make up

**yatcho** (6): I'm sorry but this is the only miss she has. She does sound lovely though

**Stryxen** (5.5): it was fun... i liked the beat

**akanewasright** (5): This is cute, but kind of... well... unfinished. It bops, but this is one of very few songs in the rate where I’m 100% okay with it leaving day 1.

**frogaranaman** (5): a song titled after a luxury car brand in this subreddit? destined to flop

**iniekcja\_** (5): ;(

**Vultuxe** (5): I was feeling but then she said the N word with a hard r? Girl why?

**Awkward\_King** (4): this one just kinda lacks essence to me, like i like it but nothing ever makes me want to play it again

**KennyEarthman** (4): snoozer. absolutely hate the gunshot sounds

**lIIustration** (4): this didn't really go anywhere, not feeling the gunshots and overly long outro

**jasannn** (3): Idk if the gun noises in the background or the way she sings the chorus but this song annoys me a lot.

**kappyko** (10): The beat sounds like a marble falling down a cartoon butthole and she sounds so fucking British. This is a perfect song.

**Mudkip1** (7): OKAY SERIOUSLY CAN SOMEONE PLEASE CONFIRM!!!: is that SOPHIE’s distorted voice saying the ‘cause im not really following the beat too much, im just doing the tempo’ part?? someone in the comments mentioned it and now it’s making me go crazy. also this song starts off great and then ends kinda shitty so im not surprised to see it land so low

---

**anothertown** (10): i love how this comes off as manic yet calm yet minimalist yet complex all at separately identifiable moments and all at the same time... defies my comprehension!

**EnCaine** (10): okay this fucking went

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the production on this track is CRACKERJACKS, it feels like that synth thing is doing acupuncture on my brain

**plastichaxan** (10): this was so close to be my 11, it's actually my favorite this album, however, i fear you all will rob it and another song has a better chance, but this is just next level

**RandomHypnotica** (10): That arpeggiating synth is hypnotic, and works PERFECTLY for Shygirl's style

**richard#0420** (10): she shows off her rap skills

**seanderlust** (10): that beat change was so smooth oml. and those synths in the background playing sixteenth notes in the background????? oh my GOD??????

**skargardin** (10): the beat omgg!!

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): She did not have to snap this hard, holy shit

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Moby's Southside found directionless, lost

**Awkward\_King** (9): i miss london

**fallenriot** (9): did i know what leng meant before i heard this song the first time? absolutely not, but it’s a bop!

**relibee2** (9): the fuck is a leng

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): EAST WEST NORTH BOYS

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the chaotic beat works really well

**pheromenos** (8.8): wait the voice at the beginning is SOPHIE's?!

**akanewasright** (8.5): This plays really well to her strengths

**bbfan132** (8.5): the slow-down at the end was fun!!

**Roxieloxie** (8.4): Leng is a large island in the Jade Sea, off the southern coast of Essos. To the north is the city of Jinqi in Yi Ti. East of Leng are the Shadow Lands, while to the south are the Manticore Isles. The island of Marahai is to the southwest. Leng is ruled by god-empresses.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8): Also quite good.

**celladonn** (8): so much impenetrable british slang on this song

**hepmeucsb** (8): Goes hard, what else to say

**iniekcja\_** (8): a splendid song innit x

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Obsessed with the flow in the chorus and the way it breaks down at the end

**slimboyfriend** (8): wtf is a leng

**twat\_brained** (8): again, like "twelve" what does the title mean? I'm just here to enjoy the tunes but I always feel like I'm missing something with the lyrics but it should just be one and done, that's how I am

**waluigiest** (8): this sounds like a drag race verse

**wavingwolves** (8): so wet that i drown and forget this leng

**yatcho** (8): not flight of the bumblebee...

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): What the fuck is a leng

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): idk what a leng is but I'm sold

**AHSWeeknd** (7): maybe I do wanna know who you am

**angryparadisecupcake** (7): this song should be the first in the ep, not twelve

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): needs to be longer

**intheaftermath** (7): idk what I was expecting but it was not flight of the bumblebee

**J\_Toe** (7): certainly different to anything else I've heard in this rate

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I go a bit back and forth with this song and I think that mainly comes down to the interpolation of Flight of the Bumblebee. It's such a meme song at this point that I can barely take it seriously but then again it does work surprisingly well. I guess a 7 fits best because the rest of the song is still really good.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): I like the trippy part at the end

**Stryxen** (6.5): I love Little Simz

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): the production on this is so interesting

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this is interesting but I would never come back to it

**TiltControls** (6): why does the beat sound like bowser jr's theme in mario sunshine?

**Vultuxe** (6): It feels like a repeat of the last few songs but slightly different lol.

**musical\_pyn** (5): i don't know what leng is and at this point im too afraid to ask

**jayjaysortagay** (4): this artist is clearly super talented but why do most of these songs have totally unlistenable melodies?

**lIIustration** (3): this production is awful and the rapping can't improve it. just forgettable.

**NFLfreak98** (1): Is this a flight of the bumblebee sample or something?

**1998tweety** (0): so she has 2 types of songs, 0s or 10s. this was already not good and then the outro shot it down lower

**ImADudeDuh** (0): the production thing that goes throughout most of the song was like getting a surprise head massage by one of these things and it did not feel good

**Misentro** (0): This is for the NFT tweets

**runaway3212** (0): I hate this so much

**vayyiqra** (0): This starts strong but the breakdown at the end is kind of a disaster and kills the momentum of the song. Sad!

**kappyko** (7): The first of two non-singles from this project to be eliminated, its slowly building EDM production kind of shows how this EP really does feel like a greatest hits compilation at some points! It's much more hushed than the high-energy production elsewhere on the EP (and in the rate), so it feels like this is a pretty predictable loss, but it somehow still feels a little too soon for something that's as effective as this! Is it just me being crazy and attaching connotations to sounds that aren't there or does that really lovely bass wobble exemplify the kind of back-and-forth motion the title implies? I don't have too much to say about this song but I will say that I accidentally played this full blast on my way to the showers and the one guy in the shower heard the intro. This was probably the gayest song possible in the rate to play at such a level.

**Mudkip1** (7): once again i find this track rather one note and uninspiring. mag bay knows how to make a cute chorus though..

---

**richard#0420** (10): #hyperpopbop

**TiltControls** (10): Maybe my favourite discovery of the rate. Not as funky as Killshot was, but it's insanely catchy

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I don’t know what else to say other than I love this

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): This is definitely one of the more lowkey tracks on the EP, but something about it just feels really comfy and nice and warm

**fairytalehigh** (9): THOSE HANDCLAPS THOUGH. I think of the Postal Service's productions (one of my all-time favorite music projects) and this reminds me of that, partially because of this song's production, partially because of the nostalgia of thinking about it. "I'll never let you stop / Don't stop" is maybe the sexiest moment on this EP

**ReallyCreative** (9): traffic lights couldn't

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I have a soft-spot for this one because I used it on a playlist for a fan fiction I’m never gonna write

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I like how she says “enough” it makes her sounds weird

**cremeebrulee** (8): i just think they’re neat [4]

**Stryxen** (8): my new years resolution is to fuck to this, i dont care that its april

**Vultuxe** (8): I don't know what she's talking about here but I think it's about sex lmao. It's so cute though

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): "Stop" is a song by English girl group the Spice Girls from their second studio album, Spiceworld. The group co-wrote the song with its producers, Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins of the Absolute production duo, during the filming of the film Spice World.

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): that bassline is thicc

**runaway3212** (7.5): okay this is good

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**akanewasright** (7): A cute little song that I have WAY too many plays of because sometimes I play killshot and forget to hit pause right away.

**bbfan132** (7): sounds pretty but i wish it had a bit more energy in it

**jasannn** (7): Cute but the most filler song on this EP

**lIIustration** (6.5): this sounds like zedd if he was poor and decent

**twat\_brained** (6.4): honestly kind of forgettable but not even that bad

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.3): eh

**angryparadisecupcake** (6): there is nothing wrong about this song but there is also nothing amazing about it as well

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i swear the song just looped, this does NOT have to be 3 minutes long

**musical\_pyn** (6): With different production, this could easily be a carly song. I'd probably like it more.

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): yawn

**hepmeucsb** (5): The claps and drum build-up are….a choice

**iniekcja\_** (5): I'm not sure if it ever even started

**frogaranaman** (4): the production isn’t for me here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i just listened to this and forgot what it sounds like

i forgot to write a comment on this which indicates how much i cared about this lmao im so sorry - kappy

**Mudkip1** (0): LOL i don’t feel like explaining myself further than the fact that i skip this almost every time i listen to it. it does nothing for me

---

**whatsanillinois** (11): HOW DO I TYPE A CRYING EMOJI ON WINDOWS PC PLEASE HELP

**angryparadisecupcake** (10): tell me you are obsessed with brokeback mountain without telling me you are obsessed with brokeback mountain

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This track is absolutely heavenly, the strings, the piano, Chris' voice all work together in such perfect harmony and it just feels so emotional and good

**steelstepladder** (10): Small and humble indeed

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): She’s singing from an actual mountaintop. Love that, such a tender song

**bulforster** (9.5): Tectonic plates be like

**dcampb97** (9.4): i cry

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Yes that’s where I remember you from!

**anothertown** (9): very very beautiful... i love mountains as imagery and metaphor

**fallenriot** (9): this kinda feels like an of monsters and men song and i’m living for that

**musical\_pyn** (9): so, so dreamy

**richard#0420** (9): reminds me of my husband <3

**runaway3212** (9): I love how this build but the start is a bit weak

**skargardin** (9): hope balladphobia doesn't ruin this one's placement but who am i kidding of course it will

**Stryxen** (9): when this comes on shuffle i immediately press repeat x

**twat\_brained** (9): that reminds me I need to go jogging with that hot classmate of mine on a mountain

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (8.7): I don't really enjoy the verses at all but the chorus is so beautiful to me that it's worth the high score anyway

**bbfan132** (8.5): love the repetition in the chorus, it’s oddly relaxing

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8.5): This is just really nice. I'm listening to this EP in the morning and it is the perfect sip a cup of coffee and exist vibe.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): oh this is lovely. the chorus is too repetitive but it's definitely growing on me

**SmileandTears** (8.5): jesus this would be so much better if she could actually sing in english. or if she sang it in french

**frogaranaman** (8): yes queen make me cry about relationships I’ve never had!!

**wavingwolves** (8): 💔

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute but a bit empty

**akanewasright** (7.5): This one grew on me a lot. The drums and strings just make me feel all gooey inside (but in a good way, my internal organs are fine)

**EnCaine** (7.5): like the percussion

**intheaftermath** (7.5): no thoughts only the season 2 Phineas and Feb car wash/mountains out of molehills episode

**hepmeucsb** (7): A nice ballad with nice delivery

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I thought she said “You fucking touch your body too?” and I was like go off, anti-masturbation queen

**Roxieloxie** (7): A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land.

**seanderlust** (7): i wish this opened up just a little bit more, like building to something a little more relieving. kinda leaves you with musical blueballs at the end.

**vayyiqra** (7): This instrumental is very nice but the lyrics could be a bit less repetitive.

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): Balladphobia strikes again, I do like this but it’s the weakest on the EP

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.3): me when im trying to fill the word count for an essay

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.2): eh

**lIIustration** (6): lowfi done well but not anything special. studying music.

**ReallyCreative** (6): meeting mountains? bitch just say you're from the coast and move on

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Pretty, but kinda boring and basic

**Vromega** (6): weak song of this ep

**Vultuxe** (6): I don't love the vocals here, or rather it's a song that doesn't play well to her vocal strengths.

**KennyEarthman** (5.5): mountains doesn't sound like a real word anymore

**wryn\_** (5.5): she has released better ballads than this. Listen to 'Make some sense' from Chris (2018) instead

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i don't want to give in to the typical popheads ballad phobia thing but this does nothing for me

**CrimsonROSET** (4): Sometimes, balladphobia has reason. The strings are pretty tho!

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): There are some parts of this song that are really nice but whenever I get into it they just start repeating things over and over pointlessly and it kills the momentum of the song

**ignitethephoenix** (4): zzzzzz now I don’t hate repetition but this is very dull

**Misentro** (1): I remember you... in the mountains

**Awkward\_King** (0): i dont think this song is very pog

**treecoh** (0): i cant stand ballads when i dont like the singers voice sorry

THE "DUMDIDDUDJDMMDDMD" HIGH TEMPO PART?? EAT SHIT FUCL

**Mudkip1** (10): the best song ever made point blank period luv

---

**LesApfels** (11): Delightfully bitchy

**relibee2** (11): I can’t give it anything else it’s electro-pop perfection.

**vayyiqra** (11): Why am I giving my 11 to this song? It's not going to win. I can't fully explain it, but this song just slaps. It randomly changes tempo and sounds like a DDR song, then goes back to half-tempo and has a dembow rhythm during the very repetitive chorus. In theory, that sounds awful, yet it works somehow. The bass on this absolutely fucks and the drums are so punchy. It's an incredibly well-produced song. Why do I love this song so much? I don't know! It has a bridge with trap beats! It's madness! I could listen to this on repeat for an hour. I have listened to it on repeat for an hour. Nothing about this makes sense but I'm living for it. ahaha drum go dum

**1998tweety** (10): best song on the ep periodt. i was not expecting a serve at this level

**Brendon-Urine** (10): disgustingly catchy

**cremeebrulee** (10): twerk anthem

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): No thoughts, head empty, drum go dum.

**endcreditouilles** (10): whew for a fake group they go ALL OUT

**ImADudeDuh** (10): its not Pop/Stars but it’ll do in a pinch

**letsallpoo** (10): the greatest song of all time

**LuisEnRod** (10): can I give an 11 to this song as well? I swear no song has got me bumping my booty in the past year as this song, the moombahton drop in the chorus is chef’s kiss

**Misentro** (10): It's impossible not to throw my ass across the whole room to this song

**musical\_pyn** (10): this contrast between the verses and chorus? Incredible

**richard#0420** (10): ALUNA UNDERRATED QUEEN

**runaway3212** (10): We love drums

**twat\_brained** (10): I've missed Aluna, she should do more of these songs! But it also reminds me of that vine that has "shut yo bubble gum dum dum lookin ass the fuck up" over that dum de dum song so that alone is 10 worthy

**waluigiest** (10): I keep waiting for them to miss. They haven’t. This project is so fun and it gets better and better.

**akanewasright** (9.5): [OMG when a trump supporter wins the EP rate](https://imgur.com/a/5N7tslG)

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): this is the type of song that just has your ass shaking involuntarily

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): the drums on this do in fact do DUM

**steelstepladder** (9.4): That title didn't lie, that drum do can go dum

**fairytalehigh** (9): "I GOT THAT BOOM GOT THAT BASS GONNA SHAKE IT IN YOUR FACE" is one of those pop lyrics that's so perfectly stupid, I absolutely adore it

**intheaftermath** (9): I do not have good vision :(

**KennyEarthman** (9): when the bridge is just onomatopoeia

**NotWith10000Men** (9): another sick chorus. all this is going on my workout playlist (is the universe doing this to make me work out again?)

**pat-rickstar** (9): DUM DI DUM DUM

**Roxieloxie** (9): The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone.

**Stryxen** (9): the way this gives me chills

**dcampb97** (8.9): BANGER

**kirby31200** (8.5): Should be annoying but is actually extremely addicting

**yatcho** (8): it's definitely giving translated kpop girl group song, and those never come out good but this surprisingly is decent

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.4): getting there

**NFLfreak98** (7.2): If you just described everything about this band and song to me it would be my early 0 frontrunner. But hey, gotta respect when something just goes hard

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This is so all over the place

**CrimsonROSET** (7): dom dirty dom dom dom

**fallenriot** (7): it’s a bop, but i’m also probably not going to listen to it again </3

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): fun!

**hepmeucsb** (7): Messy but still super fun

**plastichaxan** (7): the drum could've gone dum harder

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is fun but not as good as the previous three

**bulforster** (6.7): The instrumental is great, if only it weren't shackled to these lowkey atrocious lyrics.

**bbfan132** (6.5): this was pretty fun but nothing special

**wryn\_** (6.5): love seeing aluna get that LoL bag

**Vultuxe** (6): It's a cute mindless bop, the lyrics are unfortunate though.

**SmileandTears** (5.5): I so wanna link the d*ck go dum post from r/QueensOfLeague here but... yeah no I don't want to traumatise this sub too

**EnCaine** (5): i want to stress that it's the production that is just not doing it for me, the vocalists have been pretty good. also s/o aluna!! body music is underappreciated

**J\_Toe** (5): was never a fan of dubstep. Can't tell if that's the era being invoked here.

**jasannn** (5): It never really goes anywhere.

**ReallyCreative** (5): thinking about how Riot designated resources into this instead of making mages viable, not a horrible use of time, money, and manpower, but I'd rather Ziggs be viable

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): three of these points are for aluna

**frogaranaman** (4): meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I imagine this is what Kpop sounds like to people who don’t like it

**skargardin** (4): im sorry but this is way too annoying

**lIIustration** (3): this could be used to torture prisoners but i can't give it a 0 since i liked some of it /:

**seanderlust** (3): if you're going to have a song called "drum go dum" then the drums need to be more interesting.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this is lyrics set to music!

**angryparadisecupcake** (2): let’s pretend this doesn’t exist

**thedoctordances1940** (1): drum go dum ear go numb

**wavingwolves** (1): but can the drum go silent

**AHSWeeknd** (7): An underrated French-American fashion designer would use this as the final song for his fashion week runway show, and no one would get why. But then he’d disappear for a while, no one would notice then he’d reappear and act like he’s relevant.

**Mudkip1** (10): i personally love this song!!!! i knew this subreddit was full of homophobia.. STUD going out this early is proof of it. i wrote about it in more depth when doing the original write ups for the rate announcement, but the main takeaway that I like about STUD is how i hear so much growth as a musician he displays. it’s an unconventional, quirky song that takes you on a whole rollercoaster of confusing emotions. and sure, some of it doesn’t sound as good as other sections, but i appreciate it as a whole because it feels like a substantial leap in his career to be even more unapologetically, confidently queer. 

**ALSO!!!!!!** just a subtle reminder that I made cute graphics for every song in the rate!! you can click on the song name when it gets revealed to see the graphic, which includes the song average and a cute comment that i felt like highlighting.

**kappyko** (6): All I can think about is the time /u/letsallpoo posted Maren Morris's Girl... The Bones and titled it "when troye sivan posts a shirtless selfie"

---

**1998tweety** (11): i have never been more disgusted with the blatant homophobia i saw when yall didnt stan this song. like it has all the charli xcx p*ssy popping energy with that breakdown and yall paid it dust??? yall should be EATING THIS SHIT UP and yet?????? DUST. Yall paid it DUST. absolutely disgusting. i literally ascend halfway through this song and some stranger usually has to come grab me and bring me back down to the ground so that i dont drift away (i only listen to it inside now cause of covid but my celling is getting quite dirty, gonna have to paint it soon which will be a pain. i guess i could tie myself down before listening to it but that seems like such a pain. maybe ill lie under my bed?? idk what are yalls thoughts, its been a real struggle so ill take whatever suggestions youve got) NEways this will be a day1 or 2 robbery which i am not ready for. like yall really claim to be ahead of the times and stanning new bops but then youll do this dirty, i see you.

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): if u have ever tried to get over heartache by engaging in a string of grindr dates trying to feel something other than that hurt... yeah this is that feeling in a song

**hepmeucsb** (11): What a genius perspective for a song. Do I want you or do I want to be you?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Come through beat

**Awkward\_King** (10): i like men. quite a lot in fact. i like that this song tackles issues of body image and insecurity in the gay dating community, but also that it's a weird ass industrial dance track. the intro is definitely still my favourite part of the song, i love the vocal effects especially

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Okay wow I didn't expect a 10 to Troye but the way Troye tackled body issues and sex together in this song felt too real and relatable. " "What's it like to be so big and strong and so buff? / Everything I'm not / But could I still be a hunk to you?" MY GOD TROYE YOU FUCKING AUSTRALIAN WHITE TWINK. I am crying how this song basically attacked me to tears. 😭

**fairytalehigh** (10): This song confronts the specifically gay scenario of contemplating whether you want to be him, want to be with him, or both. Troye's delivery here is perfect.

**musical\_pyn** (10): the vibes of this song are so moody and incredible

**relibee2** (10): ashdhfjcfifjfjcifid fucking house banger much.

**richard#0420** (10): hot & super gay

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a whole banger.

**waluigiest** (10): woah. Now THIS is art. It’s panicked in a way that feels completely real as Troye flips between subtle, beautiful lyrics and pure horniness. The insecurity of the bridge is raw. And the way the instrumental guides the listener through this journey….. this is amazing.

**GloriabellVEVO\_** (9.7): Me to Henry Cavill

**CrimsonROSET** (9): troye stop being horny on main

**jasannn** (9): Easily his most experimental song yet and it paid off well.

**Roxieloxie** (9): i cant see the word stud without thinking of a harry fanfic i read on ao3 in 2014

**twat\_brained** (8.6): this hits far too close to home. home is my instagram explore page with a shirtless fitness trainer every 3 posts. That said, I'd love to train with a stud, perhaps even chill with him at his/her condo. Haha, just kidding! LOL. Unless.....??

**yatcho** (8.5): relatable content...

**engifear** (8): I know it isn't intended to be a trans song, but sometimes the lyrics feels like they are, at least to this trans guy

**frogaranaman** (8): this man is HORNY

**iniekcja\_** (8): I really remembered this EP to be way worse wtf, nonetheless https://youtu.be/_vCYlmp-t4U

**izeasklapaucius** (8): https://youtu.be/RnYecQYrqZU

**vayyiqra** (8): From a convo with my bestie /u/PeachPlumParity: "based song about body dysmorphia" :sad:

**Vultuxe** (8): This song is a wild ride, the autotune is a miss but it's a jam.

**akanewasright** (7.5): Is this song corny, and not necessarily in a good way? Yes. Is it one of the worst on the EP? Yeah, easily. Does the part with the house beat sound cool as fuck? Hell yes. I don’t have any particular attachment to this song, but it would piss me off a little if it went out first.

**bbfan132** (7.5): feels like an interesting turn sonically for troye

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Love the lyrical content here but I wish the song itself were more consistent, I don’t understand why it just kinda devolves into electronic noise at a certain point because it doesn’t really reflect the story that’s being told.

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): didn't expect that drop but it's welcome

**SmileandTears** (7.5): Well it's certainly gay but it is good? Hmmmm... idk

**seanderlust** (7.4): i think the insecurity underlying a lot of this is really interesting. i'm not gonna lie though this lost a half a point because I just hate the word stud lol.

**fallenriot** (7): i get what he was going for but that intro made me cringe and i don’t really like the breakdown in this one as much

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Troye said “Femm4Masc rights” also I feel like if this song were rearranged, it would be better. Like the verses and choruses

**nowqueenofpop** (7): Me vs liking a song almost solely bc of references to Eden and biblical apple symbolism

**runaway3212** (7): messy but good

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's a bit messy but I still like it

**wryn\_** (7): i demand more pop as good and as gay as this. lil nas and troye are not enough

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.7): He's getting somewhere with this one

**anothertown** (6): perfume genius sweetie

**steelstepladder** (6): I'm starting to realize I don't care for this ep

**intheaftermath** (5.5): buff? really?

**Brendon-Urine** (5): his intentions are good... but this is kind of a mess

**J\_Toe** (5): kind of unconventional in approach/structure (or maybe I wasn't paying proper attention)

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): the parts feel a little disjointed but on their own, half of them are okayish?

**lIIustration** (4): not sure why this had to turn into an electronic song with an ok drop

**wavingwolves** (3.5): what did you just call me

**sarcasticsobs** (3): liked the beat-pick up around 1:20 but god i hated everything prior and after

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): what on earth

**Stryxen** (1.5): the only reason this isn’t a 0 is cos i like unapologteically gay representation in music but this is irritating and barely anything about it is enjoyable

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): My internalized homophobia doesn't approve any of this.

**skargardin** (0): the vocoder effect here is TERRIBLE good god

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): he really made "WHY IS THIS BITCH?? SUDDENLY A MUSCLE DADDY?!!!! WHAT THE FUCK" into a song huh

**Mudkip1** (10): the chorus sounds soft like silk and the lyrics feel light and breezy compared to the beat. that russians lyric absolutely sends me navdjksndlkvjsn where did it come from,,, it makes me scream.  it’s so easy to miss when casually listening too which adds to the chaos

**kappyko** (9): I was honestly surprised at how poorly "Venice" performed! I love the weirdo apocalypse-by-global-warming imagery they use, and the deadpan shared vocals between Mica and Matthew take a cute note out of Oh Wonder's book. Although the line about Russians is a little corny, I'm really sad about this elimination because of how sweet the song is. It's not as flashy as the other songs on the EP, let alone the rate, but I'm a big fan of its tropical paradise, almost seapunk aesthetic. "Venice" happens to be the first music video the group have actually been given a budget for, and you can see how much fun they're having with it!

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the beach or Italy?

**Awkward\_King** (10): i have a lot of positive memories attached to this song. last summer me and my friends would go on socially distanced picnics, just to be able to see one another again. i would always play this song on the speaker. it always felt so serene. it feels like safety, it feels like im gonna be okay and i dont know how they made a song actually make me feel like that but they did and i am thankful. it just makes me happy.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It's amazing that they managed to make a song sound like the feeling when a day is so hot you're melting into your seat

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song makes me want to have Sex on the Beach, both the cocktail and the activity

**richard#0420** (10): best song on the EP

**seanderlust** (10): adds to a playlist called "Bangers Named After European Cities that's just Paris by The Chainsmokers and London Bridge by Fergie added 38 times each

**cremeebrulee** (9): i just think they’re neat [3]

**KennyEarthman** (9): this song is so dreamy

**twat\_brained** (9): dreamyyyyyyy

**vayyiqra** (9): Somehow, this sounds kind of like a city pop song to me. That is funny because city pop is a music genre and Venice is a city! What a coincidence.

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): Venice, the capital of northern Italy’s Veneto region, is built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. It has no roads, just canals – including the Grand Canal thoroughfare – lined with Renaissance and Gothic palaces. The central square, Piazza San Marco, contains St. Mark’s Basilica, which is tiled with Byzantine mosaics, and the Campanile bell tower offering views of

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): The mention of Russians made me think it was about the Cold War or some sort of European political thing I am not immediately familiar with. It strikes me as kinda "anxious but smiling through it" but I think the production could use a little more in that regard if that's the case

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): just vibez

**akanewasright** (8): I love the percussive elements that they use in the production, all throughout their work but especially here.

**fallenriot** (8): a cute summer moment

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): wait is this about global warming or something?

**runaway3212** (8): a bot chose this score for me

**Stryxen** (8): this song is ridiculously smooth

**Vultuxe** (8): I wish the chorus hit a bit MORE, but it's so sweet and bops.

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**bbfan132** (7.5): chill song to listen to

**SmileandTears** (7.5): owo

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.1): its alright i guess

**lIIustration** (7): i love the chimes but i didn't feel like i was in venice. i'm still in my house.

**ManofOranges** (7): My favorite location in Assassin's Creed 2

**musical\_pyn** (7): I really like the instrumental on this, saves the song from being mid

**nowqueenofpop** (7): Songs that sound exactly like the subject matter in the lyrics >>>>

**NotWith10000Men** (6.7): I thought it would turn into something but it never did

**steelstepladder** (6.6): This album is in desperate need of stronger dynamics

**CrimsonROSET** (6): You know when you go in a dollar store, and you find those cheap music boxes that all play the same melody? Very that.

**frogaranaman** (6): it’s a cute song

**ImADudeDuh** (6): fine

**pat-rickstar** (6): Idk this EP isn't actively bad to me I just feel nothing listening to most of it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): don't really care for it

**anothertown** (4): i forgot this as soon as it ended

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): This song is generally boring, but then it hits me with "Russians could take over" curveball to make things worse.

**hepmeucsb** (4): “And the russians could take over” ? What is this song about?

**kappyko** (10): Ah, yes, "The Single That Came Out After 'DAMN DANIEL' That People Kinda Liked at the Time and By All Means Is More Popular on Streaming" goes out day one. I genuinely don't know what puts this so below the rest of the project in terms of adoration for others, because it has pretty much all of the attributes that people like in her other songs! Maliibu Mitch steals the show with a verse over a really cool rave(?) beat switch, and happens to be my favorite guest appearance on the record; yes, above my beloved Yung Baby Tate! The vocal sample in "GUCCI" is my favorite hook on the whole project, and sometimes I'm inclined to say it's my favorite Bree song entirely. Of course, it seems like a combination of late tracklist placement and comparison to the quality of the other beloved singles means that this didn't get nearly as much love from the rate audience. But still, day one? Come on!

**Mudkip1** (8): i own sunglasses from Prada but nothing from Gucci. oh well. my cousin has one of those trendy Gucci belts though and it’s a bit of a slay. designer clothes make you feel like a bad bitch

---

**jayjaysortagay** (10): this is the coolest song in human history

**nowqueenofpop** (10): Bree was manifesting here

**endcreditouilles** (9): "snap like a breadstick" u crazy brits and ur weird version of breadsticks

**fallenriot** (9): this song makes me so excited to hear more singing from bree on her album, her voice is so nice

**izeasklapaucius** (9): LAST NIGHT I WAS SHAKING MY ASS IN THE MARIOTT

**Misentro** (9): I hate to say it but the feature brings this down from a 10

**Roxieloxie** (9): Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci in Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci (son of Guccio), Gucci became a worldwide-known brand, an ...

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): That outro is DIVINE

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I completely missed Miitch's verse I'm sorry I was thinking more about how Bree sounds like a•••lia and I hate myself for it

**bbfan132** (8.5): ughhh loved the outro, it was a smooth ending to a fun song

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): I'm not a fashion house gay so this kind of flex really isn't my thing, but I think Bree and Miitch have great chemistry so I still like it

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Probably the weakest of the singles on here but it's still so good

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): no thoughts just bopping

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): gang

**frogaranaman** (8): okay naming a song after a luxury clothing brand will probably do better than naming a song after a luxury car

**akanewasright** (7.5): This was kind of always my least favorite of the singles, but it still *slaps*

**lIIustration** (7.5): i think my biggest issue with this project is the production, and this is no exception. still catchy though.

**musical\_pyn** (7.5): like the verses on this

**runaway3212** (7.5): this grew on me

**AHSWeeknd** (7): omg we love promo for House of Gucci starring the Rah Rah Bitch 😍

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.6): eh

**jasannn** (6.5): The hook is an earworm but the rest is whatever.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): beat is really nice but the verses don't do anything for me

**Mudkip1** (9): that is amazing, like wow, oh my god

**kappyko** (8): This song was always my second least favorite from the project, which is why I'm very surprised it got the single treatment! However, what I cannot deny is the gorgeous looks Shygirl has in the music video! Essential viewing for anyone who isn't quite sure if they like this song. The usage of Euro house chords and breakbeats is a welcome introduction of more grounded dance elements into the project that some people definitely appreciated after the overt weirdness of "TWELVE" and "FREAK."

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): it feels like a jawbreaker in song form, kinda sickeningly sweet

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's funny how she pushed this, but then UCKERS blew up on TikTok instead.

**plastichaxan** (10): her iconic looks from the video may or may not be the reason this was pushed from a 9.5 to a 10

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song makes me wanna defile my body, fuck being a temple; my body is a cultist shrine located in the back of a sex dungeon underneath a Waffle House

**relibee2** (10): she really said eurodance + hyperpop

**richard#0420** (10): this is some great ballroom/vogueing music

**waluigiest** (10): okay catwalk anthem!!

**GloriabellVEVO\_** (9.5): Finally a song that doesn't scare me!

**iniekcja\_** (9): cute summer bop, makes me want a man

**izeasklapaucius** (9): big Basement Jaxx influence on this one

**musical\_pyn** (9): wait this is actually good?? i really hope this does well

**nootnoot781** (9): THIS SOUNDS SO SIMILAR TO ANOTHER SONG BUT IDK WHAT IT IS AND IT’S DRIVING ME INSANE BUT GENIUS SAYS THERE IS NO SAMPLE OR INTERPOLATION AAAAAA

**twat\_brained** (9): these songs are like an lsd hit they're so energetic but they're over before they start

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): The 90s house doesn’t gel with Shy's style, but I do like her switching things up a bit. Would like to hear her try house music but like, a different kind of house

**1998tweety** (8.5): the production on this is great

**bbfan132** (8.5): the breakbeats <3

**yatcho** (8.5): obsessed with this slightly demented take on 90s house

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.4): see title

**wavingwolves** (8.4): got an appetite for the finest things in life boy

**cremeebrulee** (8): oh this is a cute bop

**fallenriot** (8): so catchy

**ImADudeDuh** (8): it was good and then kinda ended

**Roxieloxie** (8): Yeah, you got that yummy-yum That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy Yeah, you got that yummy-yum That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy Say the word, on my way Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe Any night, any day Say the word, on my way Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe In the mornin' or the late Say the word, on my way Bona fide stallion Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run Ain't on the side, you're number one Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): love the house sound on here but like everything else feels kind of weaker compared to the other songs on the EP

**hepmeucsb** (7): I appreciate the house-influenced beat, but it doesn’t go as hard as the previous songs

**J\_Toe** (7): the house beat got my attention

**runaway3212** (7): I don't love this but it's not bad

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): not as good as FREAKY but still fun

**Vultuxe** (7): I like the production here, at least.

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): WHAT IS THIS SAMPLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**wryn\_** (6.5): i wish these songs were longer ):

**AHSWeeknd** (6): the beat is there but the production failed the vocals

**akanewasright** (6): I should like this more than I do. It just feels like it’s just a little much for me (aka I bop to it but something about it makes me feel kind of ill). This producer’s production has always been hit or miss for me, so there’s that.

**frogaranaman** (6): that piano is *chef’s kiss*

**jasannn** (6): Slayyyter's Mine did it better.

**bulforster** (5.4): The only messy Shygirl song I've heard.

**KennyEarthman** (5): average. love the slight house influence tho

**Stryxen** (5): stinky

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): don't really have any feelings

**lIIustration** (4): this is so dreary to me

**kappyko** (8): An aggressive assertion of physical self yadda yadda this is a bop it sounds like she hits the earth with a fucking hammer every time the bass hits

**Mudkip1** (7): wait this slaps?!?!?!?!?! maybe i should’ve given it higher than a 7 (note: im relistening to these while doing these writeups so i have no way of updating my scores)

**martian\_pet** (11): This EP is so good and this is my fav song in it

**fallenriot** (10): i swear she put crack in this one

**richard#0420** (10): wish I had ass to throw

**seanderlust** (10): this is filthy in all the right ways

**anothertown** (9.5): this is everything about what sla***ter wishes she could do

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): I don’t have anything to say about this other than: banger

**Roxieloxie** (9.3): Bodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyody

**wavingwolves** (9.2): this is hot (like every other song in this ep)

**Misentro** (9): Wait - I just wanna get down

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): Getting major MIA vibes from this one and I'm here for it

**twat\_brained** (8.6): someone touch me. No not you someone sexy like shygirl

**bbfan132** (8.5): i’m really liking the dark/nocturnal club sound here

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): a little GAWDY for me, but in the slutty fun way

**Vultuxe** (8.5): I think this is the nasty bop that FREAK wanted to be.

**akanewasright** (8): GOD I missed the good old “magnet-like sounds as percussion” thing from earlier hyperpop.

**frogaranaman** (8): this is wild

**iniekcja\_** (8): my hips widened and my waist shrunk about 5 inches

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.7): Not enthralled by the hook here and in general this song feels a little redundant.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I like how Body’s spelt here. B A W D Y.

**Awkward\_King** (7): i feel like i am dirt on the floor of a public bathroom but like im pretty

**hepmeucsb** (7): It’s still quite good, it just doesn’t bring much new to the table for the EP as a whole

**ImADudeDuh** (7): you know what we are? Cock destroyers cock fAWcking destroyers.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): I like the part that sounds like fast cars driving by

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): bop

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.5): This song would be a strong 8 without the intro. Was not feeling it and then was suddenly very very into it.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This part of the EP gets a little lyrically redundant.

**KennyEarthman** (6): this song is nasty & filthy

**musical\_pyn** (6): the delivery on this is the best part

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Not all too keen on her vocals at some points in this song

**1998tweety** (5): again, the production is great but her delivery kills it. go on girl give us nothing

**jasannn** (5): This really pales in comparison to the rest of the EP.

**lIIustration** (5): maybe it's just me but her rapping is really boring

**runaway3212** (4.5): honestly this is also bad

**Stryxen** (4): bored-y

**CrimsonROSET** (0): Nasty and filthy is right, but i didn’t think she meant how it sounds

**NFLfreak98** (0): Did someone actually start a beat on this song or just throw some spoons in a blender?

**kappyko** (10): The second of the non-singles out from A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling is also very easily one of the best songs on the project so... ugh! The minute details they add throughout the verses are so endearing: the flute synths, the muted chatter, the theremin... and it all comes together with that fat bass in the chorus! i dont have anything else to say and i am so bad at writing ahsfahfhahs this song is sex fuck yall

**Mudkip1** (8): for all of their songs that has the ‘one note’ vibe i think this is the most successful version of it.  the deep bass sounds during the chorus sound gnarly. and kappy’s right, there are a lot of cool small touches throughout that help elevate this song above its peers

---

**fallenriot** (10): who want me

**relibee2** (10): this is actually perfect

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Massive bop

**waluigiest** (10): love the cute tender lyrics contrasting with the FAT synths in the chorus.

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): I wish I knew of a nightclub cool enough to play this song

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): There's no way this song doesn't get robbed, we've established over and over again that popheads are illiterate, Story simply has no chance.

**akanewasright** (9): The synth explosions on the two syllables of “sto-ry” alone justify this score.

**bulforster** (9): The opening synth kinda reminds me of YNTCD, glad I can now associate it with a much better song.

**cremeebrulee** (9): i just think they’re neat [2]

**frogaranaman** (9): when those synths come in I fucking lose it

**richard#0420** (9): weeping

**Vultuxe** (9): This is rather sexy, she wants to move fast, I like the attitude. Mood

**dcampb97** (8.8): wait i love them

**NotWith10000Men** (8.7): beginning sounds just like cruel summer. Crazy about those chill verses

**outsideeyess** (8.6): production is really on point here

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Here's how Cruel Summer can still be a single.

**jasannn** (8): The bass in the chorus makes this hit harder than it really should.

**KennyEarthman** (8): opening gives me You Need To Calm Down flashbacks

**Roxieloxie** (8): an account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment."an adventure story"

**Stryxen** (8): outsold alice in wonderland

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): okay this is a bop

**twat\_brained** (8): okay bit lowkey but I'm still digging it!

**runaway3212** (7.5): one of the bests on this album

**1998tweety** (7): a bit snoozy but cute

**AHSWeeknd** (7): faux-glam fantasy 😍

**bbfan132** (7): nice song but doesn’t fully draw me in

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): its alright i guess

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Not my favorite but even their worst songs are better than some people’s best

**ignitethephoenix** (7): cute but kind of fillery

**wryn\_** (7): i love their production sooooo much

**anothertown** (6.5): One Direction "History" outpeaked

**SmileandTears** (6.5): This sounds like an Aly and AJ song

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Did y’all know that for a while, the biggest piece of literary content on the internet was a Super Smash Bros fanfiction? Then it got beaten by a Kantai Collection fanfiction. Then it got beaten by a Loud House fanfiction. What I’m saying is that the song was boring so I kept thinking about that instead.

**hepmeucsb** (6): Eh, there were some nice vocals but the chorus didn’t really hit

**lIIustration** (6): i can't peg the artist but someone else sings just like this and i'm not a huge fan

**musical\_pyn** (5): also pretty chill but still, doesn't go anywhere!!

**pat-rickstar** (5): The instrumental is good but I just don’t like her voice or the lyrics very much

**wavingwolves** (4): left no impression on me whatsoever

**endcreditouilles** (10): haha K/DA go brrr

**ManofOranges** (10): Gimme MORE

**Misentro** (10): I bought the Akali Featherknight that plays this song so I have to give it a 10

**richard#0420** (10): a perfect pop song

**runaway3212** (10): I would like more K/DA

**steelstepladder** (10): I'm bopping to this album way more than I thought I would

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is weird. It's a weird pick for a single. Its structure is weird. It has two verses back to back without anything in between. It has an unusual syncopated rhythm where it feels like it changes tempo a lot, but it doesn't really change at all. It has rapping in Korean and Mandarin, which few listeners will understand both of. Somehow, like everything K/DA does, it's also a banger. [Side note: this song also got me into Lexie Liu whose solo music is very good, so if you like this song stream her EP GONE GOLD. It's great, I swear!]

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): Giving me strong 2NE1 vibes. Soyeon's verse at the beginning might be the most badass part of the EP

**1998tweety** (9): shes cute, no popstars but still a nice bop

**angryparadisecupcake** (9): come on gays, girls and theys let’s get it

**waluigiest** (9): honestly what a serve this sounds like it could open their first stadium tour

**dcampb97** (8.9): ok bars!!

**frogaranaman** (8): fucking fun as hell

**iniekcja\_** (8): us league gays really won with this one, had the straights fuming

**jasannn** (8): So-yeon is the real carry.

**Roxieloxie** (8): a greater or additional amount of something.

**twat\_brained** (8): certainly good but just isn't doing much for me

**Vultuxe** (8): This reminds me of Bartier Cardi, but I enjoyed it.

**wavingwolves** (8): "kali got a job, kali go to work" bragging? in this economy?

**SmileandTears** (7.7): dae think seraphine bad? Ok but seriously her introduction to the world being this bridge is... well... unfortunate

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): I already know that the shitpost for this in the reveal is just gonna be the genius video for this song and I hate it so much

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.1): i have no idea what these videogame girlies are about, love em tho

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): its alright i guess

**EnCaine** (7): i liked some of the stuff in the instrumental and the hooks were pretty good

**sarcasticsobs** (7): again, that first soyeon verse is insane

**Stryxen** (7): literally just a BANGER

**bbfan132** (6.5): the chorus felt kind of anticlimactic/uninteresting

**wryn\_** (6.5): stream lexie liu's new mini album 上线了!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): the chorus of this song is confusing?

**KennyEarthman** (6): The Baddest-lite, just lacking imo

**lIIustration** (6): these raps are so fire and then the rest of the song isn't

**musical\_pyn** (6): I wish this song had more levels

**ReallyCreative** (6): Actually, I'll take Less

**slimboyfriend** (6): Ok this is how you do maximalist kpop

**yatcho** (6): g-idle is a plague I'm sorry

**anothertown** (5.5): Slightly different movie trailer type beat than The Baddest but still very similar

**fallenriot** (5.5): pretty generic, it feels weirdly devoid of energy even though it’s so upbeat?

**seanderlust** (5): idk man so far in this EP it's like...twenty second snippets of banger material separated by a minute of C plus passages

**skargardin** (5): this is a miss

**akanewasright** (4.5): This feels... kind of dead inside? I’m not sure how to put it, but it doesn’t feel *good* to me for some reason.

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): I genuinely never liked this whatsoever. Akali's part is the only thing I remember about MORE.

**J\_Toe** (4): not all k-pop is the same, but from what I've heard from r/popheads rates, I'm not sold on anything yet

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): less <3

deleted: Okay MORE going out day 1 is correct, but I'm shocked I'll show you managed to (deservedly) outlast it.

Stellar day 1 except for the gross shygirl eliminations and the questionable Gucci cut.

rickikardashian: the "voting" is done prior to the reveal. it's done by assigning a score to every single song and sending it to the host. Currently the [2020 Ultimate Sub Faves Rate](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mjy37h/2020_ultimate_sub_faves_rate/) and [2020 Ultimate Pitchfork Acclaim](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mjy31r/2020_ultimate_pitchfork_acclaim_fiona_apple_haim/) are accepting ballots
