Ladies. Gentleman. Fellow Moose and Beavers. Welcome to… **The Great Canadian Divas Rate!**
 
&nbsp;
 
* Jagged Little Pill- Alanis Morissette (1995)
 
* Falling Into You- Celine Dion (1996)
 
* Come On Over- Shania Twain (1997)
 
————————————————————————————————————-
 
 
**Jagged Little Pill**
 
Jagged Little Pill is Alanis’ third album, but it’s undeniably her most successful and most iconic. This album put female alternative rock on the map, and inspired artists like Shakira, P!nk, and Katy Perry. Prior to JLP, Alanis was a dance-pop artist who had moderate hits in Canada. Jagged Little Pill wasn’t expected to make such an impact, but when the lead single You Oughta Know began to gain airplay, the album became a colossal success. It went to #1 on the Billboard 200 charts, was the best selling album of 1996, and is the 7th best selling album of all time according to Billboard. After Jagged Little Pill, she went on to release another worldwide success, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Since the 90s and early 00s, she’s taken a break from being in the spotlight, and she’s now focused on living the best life she can. I think we ALL oughta know the legendary Miss Alanis Morissette.

**Come On Over**
 
Shania Twain was a fairly popular country star before Come On Over, but this propelled her into country and pop stardom. Currently the 6th best selling album ever in America, Come On Over helped to pioneer country-pop. It was made with the help of her partner and husband at the time, Robert John “Mutt” Lange. They were married until Shania found out that Lange cheated on her… with her best friend. Shania then married the ex husband of her best friend. It’s confusing and complicated, which makes for a perfect country wedding.

**Falling Into You**
 
Although Celine was a popular English and French singer before this album, Falling Into You contains some of her most timeless hits. It provided Celine with three Top Five hits in the United States, and became one of the best selling albums of all time. She’s made headlines recently, but not for the best reasons. Her longtime manager and husband, Rene Angelil, passed away last year from a long battle with cancer. Anyone who’s followed Celine knows how much Rene truly meant to her. To add to this tragedy, her brother died a couple of days later to cancer as well. She’s making a comeback by returning to Las Vegas, and by continuing to do what Rene would have wanted Celine to do — perform and entertain millions of people worldwide.

**The Rules:**

* Give each and every song on here a score from 1-10. I will allow decimals to the tenth, but not to the hundredth. 7.5 is cool, but don’t be that guy that thinks a song is worth 7.54. How the hell is a song 0.04 points better than another song? God is watching, so behave.
 
* Yes, you have to listen to every song. Yes, you have to listen to Celine Dion.
 
* Your scores will be shared to everyone, and you will receive shady PMs about your awful taste.
 
* You may give ONE song a score of 0 and ONE song a score of 11. If the 11 does not go to Man! I Feel Like A Woman, it is invalid. ;)
 
* You can change your scores if you want to, but if you do so on the last day, I reserve the right to scalp you bald.
 
* I will be using a program made by the wonderful /u/letsallpoo. That means that if you don’t follow the format below exactly, it’ll mess things all up and I’m not the one for that. Be smart and READ s’il vous plait. 
 
* If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to snatch your nappy dollar tree wig off your cone shaped head and force you to listen to Nine Track Mind.

**Adding Comments:**

If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

If your scores were received, I'll message you back just to confirm everything! Feel free to change your scores if you need to, some songs take time for them to grow on you! or for you to realize that they suck. However, if you change it last minute, I will go down to where you live, steal your maple syrup and replace it with Aunt Jemima, so be careful. :eyes:
 

 
You have until the end of July to do the rate!
Have fun listening to the albums, and remember: it's all for fun! I may stab a few of you, but it’s for fun!
