deleted: Hey guys, so I've been trying to balance writeups and having a full time job, along with other aspects of life (social life, physical activity, etc.). Haha, so funny story.. but I didn't actually finish all the writeups. /u/Mudkip1 was nice enough to offer to help, which I accepted. So there will be writeups for all the songs thanks to him. 

I'll be back after work to post comments and some fun facts. 

give a big thanks to /u/NapsAndNetflix and /u/Mudkip1 they did a LOT, more than they needed to.

I didn’t say that their version hit Top 10, just the song itself (Aretha hit #8). Now, this leaves us with 6 Shania songs, 7 Alanis songs, and 5 Celine songs… It’s anyone’s game for Day 3.

__________________________________________

**She’s a Natural, Woman.**

Kappyko: girl nothing beats Aretha's original but i'll be damned if she didn't try on this

cloudbustingmp3: remember when Aretha would NOT let Celine have her moment at the first VH1 Divas lmfao (Editor Note: no, I’m not a dinosaur.)


**So Uninspired**

RickiKardashian: She has an amazing and powerful voice, but this song isn’t for her. Aretha is still the GOAT singing this song

Letsallpoo: haterethra is unbothered

Therokinrolla: dont fcuking even

_________________________________________

It’s been a hot minute since an Alanis song was eliminated, but at least it went out in a cool way — a tie! It’s such a theatrical song, and I can see this being the highlight of the brand new Jagged Little Pill broadway musical. 

__________________________________________

**Queen of Jumping Into Fountains**

Cloudbustingmp3: more typical 90s alt rock but i like the drama in this

Joshually: beautiful and melancholy, like a black & white photo of Lana Del Rey.... but does anyone else want her to sing "i'll C U Next Tuesday" instead of "Sunday"? (Editor Note: It’s because good Christians meet every Sunday. You wouldn’t know.)




**I Don’t Forgive You.**

BlasiFeelsSwift: i will not jodie foster this kind of behaviour. i wanted to make a unhhhhhh reference. sue me (Editor Note: You’re not Mary J. Obliged to make a reference.)

Therokinrolla: the chorus just kinda goes. In a bad way. It doesnt seem like there is an actual melody or anything happening in that chorus, but the verses serve well enough.

Yes sir, we have a tie for 18th place! With this elimination, Shania only has 5 songs left, and my heart shattered. My favourite part of any Shania song is the random adlib at the very start. “Cool”. Which song did this tie with??

__________________________________________

**Cool!**

Letsallpoo: yeehaw!!!!!!!!

Kappyko: I'm screaming at these things she shouts before the song starts this one was literally just "cool"




**Don’t Be Stupid!**

SkyBlade79: why does this sound exactly the same as the last song. Regardless, it’s kind of tacky but pretty inoffensive. The strings are pretty fun to listen to.

There she goes… There she goes again…. Celine Dion suffers another cut, but this is different — I’m sad to see it go. It was very cute and bouncy, and a change of pace for Celine. 

__________________________________________

**Rain Drop… Trop Pop**

joshually : It feels weird to hear Celine Dion singing like an almost... trop pop reggae-lite song.... in 1996....

Cloudbustingmp3: invented trop pop

Therokinrolla: this song makes me kinda happy. Nice. invented trop pop.

SkyBlade79: I originally had this as an 8.5, but I figured I had to give my 11 to something! Somehow this sounds kind of like trop pop? It just feels so fresh and clean, it’s amazing, really. Very nice bait and switch; this song just Makes me Happy!

Another Shania deep cut is leaving us. This is such a fun, hand-clapping song that references Dr. Ruth.. what more do you want, people?

__________________________________________

**That’s The End?**

Letsallpoo: that little fake out ending is worth +2 points on its own

**She Ain’t No Lyricist (That’s For Sure)!**

Lady_sable: I like the chorus a lot! The verses are a little boring tho

_________________________________________

While 14th might not seem so significant, this song defied all the odds. Come On Over had about 12 singles, Jagged Little Pill had maybe 6 and Falling Into You 6 as well. 24 singles…. More than half of the songs in this rate were singles. When managed to outpeak so many singles, so give it some credit! It’s a bop!

__________________________________________

**A Ballop! Some Scallops!**

Lady_sable: This is a really pretty song

 Therokinrolla: a better introductory track, it balances that fabled line between ballad and bop: the ballop. Its pretty, its gorg, and Shania serves vocals

**Little Miss Grumpy:**

VeganSquash: meh, lyrics are basic and Shania's a bit monotone

Alanis’ non-single miracle takes its final bow. So what’s left? We have 5 Alanis hits, 3 Shania hits, 3 Celine hits… and 1 Celine Dion cover. Hmm, the next cut should be pretty obvious then.

_________________________________________

Oh.. dear.. This is the first hit song and maybe one of the first upsets of our rate so far. This was a huge success, yet not on popheads. Was it because we were hearing nice Alanis and not bitter angsty Alanis?

__________________________________________

**You Won Them Over:**

MrSwearword: ALANIS’ GOAT

Mustangs16: I could easily have an 11 for every album in this rate. if that were a possibility, this would be Alanis's 11 for me. it's just so sweet and simple and honestly, a huge departure from the rest of the album, and i've always loved it.

TragicKingdom1: Combines catchy pop with layers of lyrical meaning. One of my favorite songs ever

Joshually: i want someone to feel about me the way Alanis feels about this unnamed person.... :( #foreveralone (Editor Note: uh bitch you have muscles, and you’re in San Fran. Use Grindr or Jack’d hoe!)


**... But Not Him.**

_________________________________________

In 10th place, it’s Alanis’ song about learning from your mistakes. Such as the mistake y’all made by only giving this 10th place. Smh

__________________________________________


**Iiiiiiiiiiiii Recommend!:**

Skiddos: Queen of education. I found out about Alanis in the 9th grade when I had to write an essay based on this song. I bombed that essay, but it introduced me to this phenomenal album.

MrSwearword: she gets that for a lot of people, fucking up is the only way to learn any better in life.


**It’s Hard to Swallow:**


Dr_Brewer: At this point, I think I owe everyone an apology for how little I like this album when it is a renowned classic. It is clearly not my cup of tea and sounds completely different from the other two.

SkyBlade79: I feel like this is one of the Alanis songs that everyone knows, and I heard it so many times growing up. And as such, I’ve grown to hate it. I never liked it and my hate just grew and grew.

SkyBlade79: Very dated and overplayed, but it’s still a good song regardless. It does end up dragging, sadly; it seems like a full song with just the first verse and the first chorus. I know I’ll get hate for this but a 5 for me is exactly average so… sorry hunty

**A Little Too Ironic:**

MrSwearword: listing things that aren’t ironic in a song called “ironic” is not ironic. It’s bad songwriting that’s supposed to be meta-textual but is just pretentious horseshit.
