NapsAndNetflix: **45th: Celine Dion- Call The Man**

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Average: 6.046 | Controversy Score: 2.036 | [Listen Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL3-RExDlU4)

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

**Highest Scores:**

10 (1): joshually

9 (2): jamesfog, BlasiFeelsSwift

8.5 (1): Mokitsu

8 (3): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, Jelboo, Dr_Brewer

**Lowest Scores:**

4 (1): SkyBlade79

3 (4): MrSwearword, TragicKingdom1, patronsaintofaspies, Raykel

2 (1): Therokinrolla

1 (1): ImADudeDuh

Strangely enough, the first song out doesn‚Äôt have any zeros. Call The Man was Celine‚Äôs fifth and final commercial single from Falling Into You, and is just as forgettable as it was unsuccessful. D√©sol√©, Celine! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Call Me, Celine!:**

**joshually:** "Call the man he's needed here" is literally what I belt out every Friday night in my bedroom.

**BlasiFeelsSwift:** bald

**musicotic:** Bop?This is catchy af

**Stop Calling, Stop Calling:**

**MrSwearword:** bland, make it stop I'VE HAD IT OFFICIALLY

**TragicKingdom1:**  Painfully dull. No idea how this became a single.

**SkyBlade79:** Oh a christian song :(

__________________________________________

Alanis‚Äô impassioned cry for sheeple to wake up fell on deaf ears in this rate. Are we all just chained to the rhythm? Stum-bling around like a wasted zooooomm-mmmbbbb-bbbiiiiieee?

__________________________________________

**I‚Äôm Wide Awake!:**

**SkyBlade79:** I feel like this is undeniably her best song. Her harmonies are actually pleasing and even though the lyrics are weak, it works. Her vocals are just so much more varied than usual and there‚Äôs just something really strong about this track, but I can‚Äôt really explain what???

**jamesfog:** Evanescence is shaking

**lady_sable:** Angry and great


**snooze.:**

**VeganSquash:** 3 weakest of the album imo. Wake Up doesn't really connect to the album, kind-of like Mary Jane being an oddball song too, even tho that's a great song. 

**Therokinrolla:** i could really easily sleep through this track :shrug:

**cloudbustingmp3:** there's only one Wake Up by a Canadian alternative act that matters and it isn't this one #buyFuneralonitunes

Unfortunately, Fly didn‚Äôt manage to soar up into the clouds, and it suffered a crash landing. It‚Äôs a touching song (originally sung in French) about her niece that died of cystic fibrosis. Did we care? For the most part‚Ä¶ no, not really. I liked it though.

**Up In The Clouds:**

VeganSquash: wow, this is an amazing song. I just have no words, this is better then All By Myself, and I thought for sure I would've given my 11 to that. I started tearing up listening to this...just wow!


**Mayday!:**

Mustangs16: booooooooring


**We‚Äôre here for you.:**

Joshually: This song has so much meaning to me. Celine dedicated this song to her terminally-ill niece who died in her arms in the hospital, and listening to this song now always gives me chills and makes me cry, because it reminds me of my god daughter, Marielle, the daughter of my best friend Maya, who died at age 3 of spinal muscular atrophy... she died too young, too soon, and it wasn't right. As a gay man, I never wanted kids or thought I would have them, and knowing this sweet beautiful baby literally since the first hour she was born... until the day she died, the song has so much more meaning. I know people always talk about hearing songs and then they cry, and I never could relate, until Mari died and I heard this song a few months later, and the tears just started rolling down my face... "take your gentle happiness, far too beautiful for this. Cross over to the other shore, there is peace forevermore" :*-(

Celine is having a really rough day today. This is the **fourth** song eliminated from Falling Into You.. and we‚Äôve only cut five songs so far. Will the Celine massacre continue???

______________________________

**Shine On, Celine!:**

joshually: I feel like this song is probably going to be one of the lowest rated ones, but if you really listen to it, it's actually pretty great and melodically complex.

Dr_Brewer: This song is a journey as it develops from an okay but unremarkable song into something much, much better.


**Burnt Out**

kappyko: I kind of forgot I was listening to this one, sorry, but this is cute pseudo-country stuff. I can see why it's the least listened song on the album for Spotify, though.

cloudbustingmp3: i know this was released before Come On Over but it sounds like a song that was rejected from it lmao

Shania faces her second cut of this rate with I Won‚Äôt Leave You Lonely. The instrumental to this sound sounds a lot like The Police‚Äôs ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt even the ballsiest thing about this song. Did you think Shania was having a stroke near the middle of the song? That was just her singing *IN FRENCH.*. Try that, Celine.

_____________________________________________________________

**I‚Äôll Be Watching You:**

Musicotic: OK, the tonight and all night parts are amazing üòç. Why French tho. Did she live in Quebec?

Kappyko: This production is gorgeous. Was that a French line I heard? Ballsy.


**Leave Me Alone, Ho.:**

MrSwearword: what the fuck kind of The Police sample? Also, it's boring as hell.

VeganSquash: French and Spanish couldn't even save this song

Joshually: giving me Every Breath You Take tease... but without the melodic catchiness of that Police classique

Damn, Shania, three in a row! Celine could never. You‚Äôve Got a Way is a really interesting track, since it‚Äôs a mix of LeAnn Rimes-esque country and late 90s R&B. It‚Äôs one of her most adventurous tracks‚Ä¶ and it almost won the Grammy Award for Song Of The Year in 2000. Yes, we almost had to rate this song **AGAIN**.

Your House is out, and it turned out to be one of the more controversial songs in this rate. It received 3 0‚Äôs (the most out of any song in this rate), and it almost received an 11 (mine!). It all came down to one thing ‚Äî the use of a capella. Did Alanis‚Äô scratchy voice work without a backing track, or was it too much of a flaw? Also, the description of breaking and entering into her ex‚Äôs house might have not helped her.

_________________________________

**Queens of Breaking and Entering!:**

rickikardashian: Im dead the best song of the album is a 2 minute hidden track with no instrumental

Therokinrolla: my god her voice is such a perfect monster, whatever that means. I love just her voice, the rasps, the voice cracks, everything is so dramatic and emotional. This song doesnt need instrumentals. Her voice is everything

VeganSquash: queen of breaking and entering

**Ooh.. That was ROUGH:**

Ok, we all know what this is about so I'm not really going to explain. Emmy darling, arguably the most popular Netflix show, and overall pretty great. It's obviously good enough for people to sabotage it, so that's telling. Uzo Aduba (Taylor Swift's squad) is incredible as Crazy Eyes and has won Outstanding Actress for playing her at the Emmys multiple times, but what is cool is that once it was in a Comedy series and once was a Drama series so she's the first person to win both categories for playing the same character. Season 3 of this show is uh, not good, but Season 4 may possibly be the best and redeems any flaws Season 3 had. The show has been renewed until minimum 7 seasons, so get used to hearing about this show for a few more years at least!

---

**gannade:** i don't know how a show about problematic women in jail can be so boring but it is

**blasifeelsswift:**  gross, unrealistic and overrated, prisons aren't like that and most of the characters are too simple

**ThatParanoidPenguin:**I know y'all are gonna drag this and nothing beats the 10/10 that was s1 and s2 but the other season are damn good too.

**twat_brained:** I'd give it a 10 if Piper turned Face again or if she was just given a better character arc.

**Jamesfog:**  I like this show sorry bout it

**poppinmmolly:** I loved the first 2 seasons of this show. So good. I liked the diverse characters. It was a compelling story.

**TheStarSquad:** Season three was a mess, but season four redeemed the show for me.

**InfernalSolstice:** Would be an 11 if it wasn't for season 3. Season 2 and 4 are 2 of my favorite seasons of television. The characters are all extremely well written, even if they all aren't always enjoyable.

**AbnormalPopPunk:** when it started it was bomb and now its... meh

**Nerdy_boy_chris:** overrated garbage.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy:** First season is amazing. Second season is perfect. Third season is garbage. Fourth season is a great season. Hopefully the fifth season continues to rule the show.

**PM_ME_UR_FAVE_MOVIES:** Lorna did nothing wrong and I will fight you

**ignitethephoenix:** The first 2 seasons were amazing. Being introduced to all the characters in the first season, and having Vee as the villain for season 2 made it one of the most compelling new shows out there. However there was a little slip with quality in season 3, but season 4 may have been the best season yet, with some dark thematic material, and one of the most [spoiler](#s ‚Äúheartbreaking deaths‚Äù) on a tv show to date. This show blends comedy, drama and social issues very well, and it's definitely a binge worthy show that also keeps you hanging and wanting more each season. Acting is really good too, this show easily has one of the best ensembles in all of tv.

**VodkaInsipido:** Every character is perfect. First seasons were funny, but the fourth just gets you a tear in THAT moment. The finale may be a bit crazy and out of place, but I hope they can pull it off.

**Elitefourbrad:** This is easily the best show on Netflix by far when it's at it's best. Season 3 was just too horrendous to even watch with so many problems to list. It almost made me stop watching the show, but Season 4 and 5 made up for it for sure, but my favorite character easily is Nicki. I love the humor she can come up with just on the spot.

**(Side Note: there‚Äôs only 4 seasons and he sent this before the fifth season leaked so idk what he‚Äôs talking about. Discuss.)**

**superr_rad:** honestly the first two seasons were good and the most recent season was better than the ones before BUT this show is super overrated and focuses way too much on Piper. im not mad at what happened to [spoiler](#s ‚Äùpoussey‚Äù) (i am upset tho she was my favorite character) because this shit happens all the time in the prison system and nothing happens to the ~~murderers~~ police that do this. its also saying a lot how there were more tweets about a fictional characters' death than an actual human being's death in a similar situation. i guess im using this opportunity to say how important it is to talk about police brutality and how fucked up the prison system is, and if you think the government won't let this happen to people [you are sadly mistaken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Tutwiler_Prison_for_Women). 

**scherbadeen:** Season one was the best part of this show, and I'm convinced people only bother to keep watching it because of some weird mob mentality or something. Love yourselves, y'all.

**seferre2:** i was obsessed with oitnb at once, but honestly only because of tumblr. i think it's sad and it is realistic and the first seasons are so awesome, especially the second. i think that ointb has the most satisfying season finales of any show i've ever seen. the characters are cool and the casting is probably the best i've known too. except that when season 4 came out, i couldn't get myself to finish the show. it's just that the episodes were too long and the show kinda began to creep me out a little and i just decided it wasn't for me anymore. i've finished season 4 though by now and i'll probably watch season 5 sometime when it comes out actually

deleted: Hi guys, thank you so much for participating! <3 Give a huge thanks to /u/NapsAndNetflix, he did a lot of work on short notice!

It looks like there's been an issue with a score submission. /u/seferre2 I wholly apologize for not including your scores. The last week has been a rush of finishing writeups, calculating scores, and real life shit, so it's my bad.
