Disco/Funk Revival Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/hjupu6/discofunk_revival_rate/

Hello, fellow purveyors of REAL dance music /s. Welcome to the **Disco/Funk Revival Rate**, aka the excuse to heap overwhelming praise on our glorious AutoMod that we have been searching for for years. My name is ~~Giovanni Giorgio~~ u/camerinian, long time rater, first time host, joined by my fantastic co-host u/steelstepladder, ditto. Strap in, slap the bass, and ignore the discourse of this rate coming before the actual disco rate next month, meaning we're talking about four European white dudes doing the sound first haha oooooops.

**Calvin Harris, Daft Punk,** and **Mark Ronson** are three of the biggest names ever associated with the art of music production, and yet the respective albums that we'll be discussing are very much separate from the wheelhouses each of them are known for. Each of these albums marked significant shifts in the artist's sound, and although all of them released at different points in the 2010s, they also mark significant departures from the zeitgeist of popular music around them at the time. All three albums also reflect a collaborative spirit that often makes each track its own beast, and I can almost guarantee there won't be another rate in this sub that touches on Miley Cyrus, Animal Collective, Young Thug and King Princess all at once.

# Calvin Harris - Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1

As perhaps the single most prolific and influential figure in pop-EDM in the 2010s, Calvin Harris definitely needs no introduction to this crowd, and yet even for his smorgasbord of influences he's noted through his discography, it would still be difficult to fathom that his next collaborative single after his latest world-conquering Rihanna smash would be a straight up funk song that features both Frank Ocean and Migos, two artists known for very much not that. Yet not only was Slide that heel-turn, but it was indicative of the sound for his entire next project, mashing together some of the biggest names in pop, R&B and hip-hop with summery, lush production that many of them had scarcely touched before. Encompassing icons such as Snoop Dogg and Pharell, then-newcomers such as Khalid and Lil Yachty, out and out pop superstars like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry and everything in between, the album saw Calvin Harris gain a wave of newfound critical acclaim and a swath of new fans, and whilst this album didn't feature a worldwide smash the size of We Found Love or Feel So Close (which may be the main reason we won't see volume 2 for a while, if ever) it did score Harris a Grammy nomination for Producer of the Year.

In order to level out the tracklists and keep it fair to ol' Adam, we'll also be including the two sibling tracks to this album that didn't make it on - the one official Funk Wav remix and one extra track that somehow ended up in the custody of DJ Khaled

# Daft Punk - Random Access Memories

As undeniable icons of house music, it makes sense that Daft Punk would set their grand comeback album to drop in the Summer of 2013, when EDM was as popular and inescapable as it's ever been. What wasn't expected was that their first single would almost entirely shun the sound of the time, instead opting for a bright, sunshiny disco number with actual 70s and 80s legend Nile Rodgers contributing his slick guitar and Pharrell kick-starting a comeback of his own on vocals. Get Lucky kept a focus on irresistible funk grooves which would resonate throughout Random Access Memories, but the album is still unmistakably Daft Punk, what with the trademark vocoders, allusions to grand space-time adventures and surprising emotional complexity throughout. This combination of past and future meant it was almost guaranteed to perform, and perform it did, with it becoming one of the biggest sellers of the year and leading to Daft Punk taking two of the top three big Grammy categories that year.

# Mark Ronson - Late Night Feelings

Of the three acts we'll be discussing, Mark Ronson has been the only one to consistently draw inspiration from old-school dance styles throughout his career. Through his early solo work, his production for the likes of Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga, and of course his world-dominating track Uptown Funk, he's shown a penchant and a true adoration for the sounds of the past in many fashions, a trait which he carries on to Late Night Feelings. From the country-infused grooves of lead single Nothing Breaks Like A Heart to the shimmering disco of the title track and glimmering synthpop on Find U Again, Ronson brings an eclectic mix of sounds and guest collaborators, all women, into a groovy yet moody rumination on breakups and loneliness.

# Rules

If you've rated with us before, you know how this works. If you haven't, ~~leave while you still can~~ welcome!

&#x200B;

* You must rate **EVERY** song in this rate, no exceptions.
* Each song can receive a score between 1 and 10, and decimal points up to 1 place are allowed (e.g. 5.6, 7.3, 9.9 - NOT 5.62 or 9.99).
* You may give a 0 and/or an 11 to only one song each. An 11 or 0 are not required, but where's the fun in not being a bit passionate?
* You are highly encouraged to also provide comments for the songs as well as scores. Comments are not mandatory, and you can put them on as many or as few as you like, so long as you follow the correct formatting as labelled below.
* You can edit your scores and comments at any time up until the final cutoff date, which will be determined at the end of this month. Just message me u/camerinian or u/steelstepladder and we can tweak it for you.
* Not that any of these artists are particularly stan-heavy (I think?) but if there are any obvious attempts at sabotage via deliberately and excessively lowered scores, we will ask you to change them, and failing that, we reserve the right to exclude them from the rate. We're relying on honesty and integrity here.
* There is exactly one correct way to format your comment, and it is as below.

>True Blue: 10 I blue myself

&#x200B;

* This is how NOT to properly format a comment:

>The Game of Love: 0: I can't believe I lost the game

&#x200B;

>Feels: It feels right for me to give this a 6

&#x200B;

>Beyond: (2) I prefer Bed and Bath

&#x200B;

* You may also write comments for the album as a whole, directly next to the album title in the prepared message link.
