**camerinian** (11): As I write this, submissions have formally closed but we’re awaiting a few extension ballots. As I write this, this song has currently just scraped into the top 20. As I write this, my hopes for this masterpiece have been achieved, because this is one of the most awe-inspiring pieces of music I have ever heard in my life, and I genuinely believe it’s among the greatest closing tracks of all time. This song is such a perfectly distilled thesis statement for not just this album, but Daft Punk’s entire career that it is jaw-dropping. The atmosphere and narrative built by the airy, sparse instrumental underneath that space shuttle comms sample is simple but incredibly effective in setting the stage, and from there, it is pure space opera grandiosity, from the energy and power of the beautifully captured and astoundingly played orgasmic tight drum fills to the drop-out to the evocative synth chords, to of course the building intensity of the screeching synth over the last half of the track that just keeps increasing in volume and sharpness on the ear to build this sense of impending terror as the rest of the mix collapses into a controlled cacophony, before finally sizzling away and just leaving us with an alien buzzing, letting the audience complete the story how they see fit. I knew this would never have a chance of getting near the top of the rate, given how it is very challenging, very un-pop and not even really a funk or disco song as much as it is a genre-bent techno prog rock noise oddity, but I’m just awestruck by this song every time I play it. If this was canonically the last song Daft Punk released under their name, I think I’d be happy with that. (but album 5 can also come any time guys)

**Steelstepladder** (10): Such a great ending to the album. Perfectly gives you the entire feel of the album in a satisfactory conclusion. And when those waves of synths hit it just sounds breathtaking. I honestly wish more of the album used as diverse a soundscape as this song.

---

**bbfan132** (10): such an epic final track, wonderful outro to such a diverse album

**bespectacIed** (10): wanna live inside this song

**bulforster** (10): I am ASCENDING, I'm really tempted to give this my 11 but I feel like my other contenders have a better shot at winning.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): literally a galactic journey

**CrimsonROSET** (10): If this is what it feels like, abduct me right now!

**jexan13** (10): Amazing. I swear that if this goes out before day 3 because you all don't like instrumentals tracks, I will call the marcianito que baila cumbia 100% real to probe your asses

**MrSwearword** (10): this makes a wonderful closer to the album

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the ending though

**sarcasticsobs** (10): THAT’S HOW YOU CLOSE

**wavingwolves** (10): great closer we love it

**Chevsapher** (9.2): How do I even assign a number to this??

**hunnybee12** (9): we levitating

**pat-rickstar** (9): It's an epic closing song

**waluigiest** (9): this really takes us all over

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): What an ending

**pisces\_king** (8.4): The most cosmic, if I dare say intergalactic, songs on the album. A blast-off.

**Hielord** (8.1): Such a good closing track, although the last part is kind of annoying.

**1998tweety** (8): i feel this one a bit

**teenage\_meme** (7.5): this went on waaaayyyy too long

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this made me go feral near the end, but in a good way

**J\_Toe** (7): Katya is shook

**rickikardashian** (6.8): **WHY IS THE VOLUME GOING UP ALL THE TIME STOP ITTTT** >!i know the hyperpop bitches are going to eat this up!<

**vayyiqra** (6): I feel bad but I feel like this song isn't that great and it's a long closing track to an already very long album but also I don't know how to end it better so it's satisfactory and also goes with the spacey theme of the album and their music

**anothertown** (4): this is panic attack music

**purplechilipepper** (2): hate that were leaving like this

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I was enjoying this until that awful noise that increases in pitch came in . And then they added another annoying pitch at the end. sorry this is awful

**lapascalia** (0): I had to give one song my 0 and I was really bored listening to this…

**camerinian** (7.5): Ok this one is absolutely a grower, and I reckon it would've been even higher if Yebba didn't wedge herself in between two much weaker and super unnecessary interludes. The urgency of this song is incredibly potent, and the frantic groove over the chorus punctuated by the strings is maybe the most immediate one on this album. This is a really strong track, and it's just let down by its own sequencing.

**Steelstepladder** (5): I've listened to this song a few times and I'm not sure what's not clicking with me. I think it might be YEBBA though, because while she is a good singer I don't think she has a very distinct personality.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the way this has a tropical vibe without sounding dated... ICONIC

**sarcasticsobs** (10): love those jungle-like drums

**waluigiest** (10): BANGER ALERT they shoulda skipped knock knock knock and started here

**jexan13** (9.5): This song is not unique. Everyone has done what this song has. But I think that this song does all of that greatly!

**CritneySpearz** (9): just love Yebba’s voice wow.

**lapascalia** (9): The strings sound really wonderful, it’s a beautiful song and I love YEBBA’s voice

**pisces\_king** (9): Yebba's voice is deep, alluring, enchanting; needless to say this song enthralls me!

**skargardin** (9): banger

**SmileAndTears** (9): Homegirl got me in my feelings

**TragicKingdom1** (9): yebba is being quietly yet forcefully pushed by the industry and this is the sole point she's made

**Chevsapher** (8.4): The production is lush and the vocals are amazing. If the chorus flowed better and felt less rigid, this sound would easily be a 9.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): for some reason, I can vividly picture this song being performed as a Eurovision entry

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a bop for sure

**pat-rickstar** (7): The best of the 3 Yebba songs but not much of a highlight in this album for me

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): i think i've heard this before.....it sounds familiar.

**wavingwolves** (7): fine but only that

**bbfan132** (6.5): i was looking forward to a smooth neo-soul track but this is just a semi-good dancehall/pop track :/ still pretty enjoyable but i wish it was better

**CrimsonROSET** (6): These songs are starting to blend together.

**oliveoilgarlic** (6): music to try on pastel pants in the H&M fitting room to

**purplechilipepper** (6): chill bop

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this sounded really 2017 and not in a good way

**MrSwearword** (4): the Claptone remix is leagues ahead of the original

**bespectacIed** (2): annoying ass voice

**camerinian** (8.5): I had to actively train myself to unhear the remix of this cos I just straight up thought it **was** the original for a long time, but yeah, the original is cool, a bit looser, a bit janglier, a bit more raw, got some interesting flourishes that the remix takes out. The tone in the verses is a bit weirder though tbh

**Steelstepladder** (8): I've never done a deep dive into Lykke Li but maybe I should because this is good!

---

**wavingwolves** (10): to dance to the remix of this while drunk is to know blissfulness but this version is amazing too (and probably better)

**Hielord** (9.5): I'd give the Magician remix an 11 tho

**lapascalia** (9): I’m used to hearing the FlicFlac remix (which is amazing btw), but the original is also great

**anothertown** (7): famously this song was in one of the worst ever episodes of glee, it’s just ok

**camerinian** (8.5): I can't believe I didn't like this one when I first heard the album. I just adore the warmth radiating out of every aspect of this. The multi tracked harmony on Panda Bear's vocals is just subtle enough to add a feeling of sing-along friendliness without compromising on rawness, and of course the vocoder hook is an all time earworm. Maybe I wish there was more evolution in the production, but this is a late night driving anthem regardless, love it

**Steelstepladder** (7): This is such a coinflip for me. If I'm in the mood I can think this is one of the best songs on the album but if not it can actually be quite annoying.

---

**RandomHypnotica** (11): my main motivation for doing this rate was so that I could give my 11 to this song. Honestly, it's pretty low-key, but it's just so damn solid. Panda Bear's vocals, the looping "Doin it right", the clicking drumline, it all just comes together so well.

**TiltControls** (11): I honestly thought this track was from one of Daft Punk's earlier albums the first time I heard it. It does such a good job connecting every element of the production and performance together and delivers one of the catchiest songs of their career.

**bespectacIed** (10): daft punk and panda bear, literally an indie boy's orgasm. Plagiarized t.A.T.u - All the Things She Said but i forgive because this is brilliant, life-affirming, hypnotic. Completes my holy trinity of indie songs about dancing (Dance Yrself Clean, Bodys, this)

**grinchelda** (10): unfortunately someone is almost always doin it wrong

**letsallpoo** (10): why is this copying zara larsson - all the time

**lostonthewayh0me** (10): i feel this song in my soul.

**teenage\_meme** (10): the human vocals go so nicely with the robots on this one!

**Hielord** (9.5): Kings of repeating the same sentence through the whole song

**bulforster** (9): The barebones of an amazing song but still great as is.

**Chevsapher** (9): Sometimes less is more.

**MrSwearword** (9): the human vocal isn't right for this. Let the French robot do the werk for you here.

**pisces\_king** (8.8): The intro is so good, and the beat only gets better over the course of the song.

**anothertown** (8.5): I completely forgot all about panda bear. Society has finally progressed beyond the need for early 2010s indie man voice. This does bang despite it all

**bbfan132** (8.5): panda bear on a daft punk track??????? i’m so here for this, i love his voice and presence here

**jexan13** (8.5): Well, at least it's catchy

**lapascalia** (8.5): This is pretty smooth, I like it

**oliveoilgarlic** (8.5): as soon as this came on I started humming the “if you do it right let it go all night” part

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Weirdly slaps

**CrimsonROSET** (8): We love repetition!

**vayyiqra** (8): Why is Panda Bear hated on this because this is a great song and maybe his shouty vocals weren't amazing but this song still fucks so help me understand

**waluigiest** (7): the robotic hook is great but the other voice is annoying

**1998tweety** (6): meh

**wavingwolves** (6): not doin' it right enough

**Steelstepladder** (9): Just another solid groovy bop. And while this album does have better bops I still really think this one pulls it's own weight and is a joy to listen to.

**camerinian** (8): So I guess here’s the answer to the question nobody was asking - “What if Daft Punk made a Fleetwood Mac song?” And it’s good! Really good! The full live band groove is incredibly tight and very fun, and the vocals are perfectly on the balance of wistful and energetic. I like that it’s one of the few songs that lyrically actually addresses nostalgia too, but does it in a way that it comes away with the message of using it to enhance your everyday life going forward. It’s a really pragmatic view on it, and I dig that sentiment. Also the breakdown is just fucking so great. Massive tune

---

**bespectacIed** (10): this song reminds me late night car rides with my parents when i was young, sleepy at the backseat, watching the red and orange car lights go blurry

**1998tweety** (9.5): I love lounge music

**bulforster** (9): Random soft rock track? Why not when it's this good.

**SmileAndTears** (9): Gordon Ramsey voice finally some good fucking music

**teenage\_meme** (9): i LOVE the production but not the vocals :/

**Chevsapher** (8.6): Is that a steel guitar?

**pisces\_king** (8.6): So groovy! Move your hips okay!

**Hielord** (8.5): Faux-nostalgia is my favorite genre

**rickikardashian** (8.5): \*adds to my “disco space cowboy songs” playlist

**bbfan132** (8): apparently todd edwards is a uk garage producer so it’s interesting to see him on a soft/yacht rock track… he’s definitely versatile!

**vayyiqra** (8): This French robot album has slide guitar on it and it works HOW

**wavingwolves** (8): feels like a soundtrack

**lapascalia** (7.5): It’s ok

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): This sounds like a song you'd hear in a movie that's a spin-off of a tv show where the characters travel to Europe, and when they're exploring the town this would be playing

**MrSwearword** (7): the vocals aren't selling it all that much

**oliveoilgarlic** (6): early 80s new wave but make it a big Philly disco anthem partway through and make the overall vibe tv theme song

**purplechilipepper** (6): this is nice and chill but forgettable

**camerinian** (7): Look, it really does pale in comparison to the other Daft Punk/Pharrell/Nile joint, but this is still very much a bop. Find me having a boogie in the living room to this, pretending it's Studio 54 or some shit

**Steelstepladder** (7): This is the natural evolution of that one song that Daft Punk has made on every one of their albums. You know the one with the admitably repetitive hook as the instrumentals just do Daft Punk things around it. That's not a bad thing, but I honestly don't feel like this song needs to be 6 minutes.

---

**oliveoilgarlic** (11): IN THIS HOUSE WE LOVE AND RESPECT NILE RODGERS AND HIS RHYTHM GUITAR HAND. PERIOD. FOREVER.

**bespectacIed** (10): better than get lucky, i think we should have that conversation

**Hielord** (10): The definition of an eargasm

**MrSwearword** (10): THE VIDEO OF THIS SONG OVER SOUL TRAIN FOOTAGE IS GLORIOUS. Also, slay

**lapascalia** (9.5): It’s such a simple but effective song, I feel like it’s impossible not to move while hearing it

**teenage\_meme** (9.5): i didnt like pharrell's voice at the beginning, but otherwise this is perfect

**bbfan132** (9): a midtempo disco/funk jam, enjoy this a lot

**CrimsonROSET** (9): :clap:

**pisces\_king** (9): Pharrell on this makes it feel so classic.

**Chevsapher** (8.8): I don't need to hear about Pharrell's sweaty shirt three different times, but those vocoders are delicious.

**vayyiqra** (8): I want to ask why Pharrell keeps getting asked to sing on things when his voice is so weak here and also this song is very repetitive but also so good I don't care

**waluigiest** (8): I vibe with it but I think it’s just.... too slow to lose yourself to dance tbh

**wavingwolves** (8): well if we're being honest this is a better pharrell collab than get lucky

**grinchelda** (7.5): if you insist

**jexan13** (7.5): In the context of the album is kinda nice but... As a song, alone, it goes on forever, despite the niceness

**1998tweety** (7): she's alright

**pat-rickstar** (7): Get Lucky's little sister but not as good as its sibling

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): the beat. the bassline. this song is great, it just pales in comparison to some of the others on the album.

**bulforster** (6): It has some good ideas but gets way too repetitive

**CritneySpearz** (5): annoying

**SmileAndTears** (5): Did they really need 4 songwriters for this?

**camerinian** (8.5): On my first listen to the album, this was easily my favourite non-single. I love the fuzzy electric guitar, the free-wheeling chemistry of the numerous vocalists, and the numerous incredibly sticky hooks. It's diminished a little since then, but I still love the kind of sleazy, looser vibe of it all. Alicia Keys is the most on form here that she's been in years.

**Steelstepladder** (8): Alicia Keys sounds kind of like Janelle Monae here and that's never going to be a bad thing. It's a bop!

---

**bespectacIed** (10): which way? I hope to Day 3

**pisces\_king** (9.7): Absolutely love this one!! I have never heard of The Last Artful, Dodgr but I love their voice.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Give it to me bad, Alicia.

**grinchelda** (9): now that's a jam

**purplechilipepper** (9): this song slaps solely on the energy of the vocalists fuck yeah

**Chevsapher** (8.6): This attitude is addictive, and the piano over that grungy bass is such a mood! My only issue is that the chorus and prechorus (chorus and post-chorus?) don't really stand out.

**bulforster** (8): Alicia is great on this.

**SmileAndTears** (8): This sounds alien-ish but I love it

**teenage\_meme** (8): i like the harder sounds!

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a vibe and appropriately for a song with Alicia Keys it has a neat piano riff

**wavingwolves** (8): oh this goes hard yes

**1998tweety** (7.5): boppy

**anothertown** (7.5): weird how Mark Ronson made this disco revival/pastiche and only 2 tracks have black people on them?

**bbfan132** (7.5): i didn’t know that this existed until right now and i’m happy that i discovered it, alicia sounds v good here

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.5): this sounds SO NEW YORK

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Lacks a bit of catchiness but a solid song nonetheless

**Hielord** (7.3): I liked Alicia Keys, just that

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): this reminds me of Igor Theme’s at the beginning

**MrSwearword** (7): cute for how left field it is, but aside from that, it's not worth many listens

**jexan13** (6.5): I absolutely loathed this song the first times I listened to it. I still feel is one of the album ruiners. It's the vocals here. They sound so irritating and I don't understand why. The song isn't bad tho.

**vintagebathingsuit** (6.5): the oooohhhh bit sounds like the ooohhh from same old love

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.1): Alicia a bit off keys here

**skargardin** (6): This had all the potential to be one of my favs but I just don't care for it like that

**camerinian** (10): This one really caught me off guard. I did not expect there to be this strong of a ballad hiding out at the end of the album first time through, but holy shit this really works. Lykke Li's delivery is achingly beautiful and the production provides just enough of a vessel for the power of the vocals and the heart-aching lyrics. If I had this song in my life during a major breakup, this would probably be a massive late night cry song for me. Magical

**Steelstepladder** (6): This is appropriate because it sounds just like a song that you would get emotional to at two in the morning. Once again though if I'm being honest I don't think Lykke Li was the best choice for a song this stripped back.

**lapascalia** (9): Honest and relatable

**vayyiqra** (9): As I write this, it is 02:37, late at night and I am in my feelings :pensive: Also, as I have said on every track she is featured on, I really love Lykke and hate how underrated she is. If you know her solo music you can see why she is the perfect choice for a song with this theme.

**pisces\_king** (8.7): This sadness feels different from the other sadnesses on the album, not in my favorite way, but nonetheless a gorgeous track.

**Chevsapher** (8.2): The songwriting is solid, but the track starts to feel a little monotonous after a few minutes.

**anothertown** (8): balladphobia will tank this but it’s such a pretty soul/country bop. It should have been placed elsewhere in the tracklist since it sounds so different to Spinning, I feel like it’s just here because it’s down tempo.

**wavingwolves** (8): this one is pure late night regrets and we love it

**bbfan132** (7.5): a folksy track on this album? surprised but it’s solid, lykke has been serving on this album

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.5): sad yeehaw

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): A decent slow jam

**ImADudeDuh** (5): am i the only one that’s officially tired of songs named after times?

**waluigiest** (5): the baby voice....

**MrSwearword** (1): it's just really badly delivered in almost this babytalk but attempting to be...actually I can't describe what makes this garbage but it is.

**Steelstepladder** (9): Oh man this is such a good opener. Just gives you everything you're in for for the entire span of the album. Honestly I kind of wish they brought the distorted guitar back for more songs because it gives the song so much oomph. Great stuff.

**camerinian** (8): wanky r/music top post title aside, holy shit this is so much fun. This is basically just Daft Punk giving Nile Rodgers a platform to show how awesome he has always been, and God damn does he hold down that groove marvellously. Though Daft Punk are doing wonders with their dynamics and perfectly placed crashing swells, this is kinda Nile's track, and it is such a brilliant opener in that regard.

---

**bulforster** (10): Nile Rodgers is a legend, those guitar passages are amazing.

**skargardin** (10): banger

**vayyiqra** (10): B O P

**pisces\_king** (9.2): The beat along with guitar strums woven around it is so damn good.

**lapascalia** (9): This song is the definition of groovy

**MrSwearword** (9): a great opener

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): the way this is all live instrumentation

**wavingwolves** (9): probably one of the best opening tracks of the 10s

**Chevsapher** (8.6): It's a bit too long, perhaps, but those textures are perfect.

**jexan13** (8.5): Pretty good for an opener

**CrimsonROSET** (8): You know the song of a menu that has an actual song to it, but then has just a repeating part that isn't meant to be heard for long because you're supposed to just get to the thing you're supposed to do? This feels like that song.

**pat-rickstar** (8): Sets the tone for the album pretty well, it’s a good opener

**vintagebathingsuit** (8): funkkyyyy yes let's gooo

**waluigiest** (8): they said IT’S SUMMERTIME 😡

**rickikardashian** (7.9): a track to start getting excited for Get lucky

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): decent but sounds a little too similar to Get Lucky.

**grinchelda** (7.5): what more does music want from me

**bbfan132** (7): pleasant intro but nothing else to it really - still an enjoyable instrumental so i can’t justify giving it a lower score

**SmileAndTears** (6): The intro of the song is epic but then it just goes nowhere

**camerinian** (9): ok fine you caught me I didn't know who Giorgio was before I heard this album, I was 16 ok give me a break. Anyway, befitting a legend, this song is fucking amazing and just as much an application for Daft Punk's canonisation as it is Giorgio's. The way in which they take this entire interview wholesale and effortlessly insert their track around it is nothing short of genius, and when Giorgio gives them the opportunity to let loose and disregard the rules of music, they basically incorporate all of their albums to this point into one giant epic, from the harsh scratching of Homework, the epic arrangements of Discovery and the roaring electric guitars of Human After All. It is masterful, and while the runtime can be a bit of a turnoff, allowing yourself to get lost in it all is a hell of an experience

**Steelstepladder** (9): Out of all the songs in the rate this is the one that I'm the most curious to see the scores come in for. I have no idea what popheads is going to do with a song this long and this unorthodox but I really appreciate it's purpose in the album and love they had the follow through to give Giorgio the time he deserves.

---

**bulforster** (11): Yessss, educate me about the foundations of electronic dance music robot overlords!!

**CrimsonROSET** (11): holy shit

**skargardin** (11): Giorgio is such an icon in disco.. END me with your monologue YAAAS

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Just a really cool, non-traditional song. Giorgio Moroder is one of the titans of disco and this is a really unique way to celebrate his influence.

**vayyiqra** (11): I have such strong feelings about this song. It's nine minutes long and it's an old European man talking over a repetitive disco beat. Improbably, it stirs more emotion in me than anything else in this rate. It's so beautiful that they got this legendary producer to appear on an album that's a homage to the genre he largely created, and this old man who's had such a memorable and full life is reflecting on it to them. It makes me wonder what it will be like when I'm that old, thinking back on my own youth and what that will be like, and that's kind of a scary thought but also, ironically for a song by two robots, a very human one. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this song, to realize that they're not just funky - they say something deep about LIFE.

**vintagebathingsuit** (11): when the strings come in and the rest of the song crashes in with extra force......love this song.

**bbfan132** (10): giorgio moroder is a fucking legend and the second half of this track is insane, love the space-age disco vibes here

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): legends only

**jexan13** (10): Iconic, inspirational and the music parts are actually very good. Damn, I'd love to make some unique bops too, Moroder. Too bad I'm poor and talentless

**MrSwearword** (10): it's essentially Giorgio Moroder's Behind the Music and I am all the way here for it.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this is ART

**sarcasticsobs** (10): oh my GOD when it finally kicks in YES

**wavingwolves** (10): this has a better narrative structure than several books i've read

**Chevsapher** (9.5): The strings, the scratches, the harmonies, the layers!

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): It's a great piece of music but because of how long it is, it's unlikely I'll ever revisit it much

**anothertown** (9): Icon, stream I Feel Love by Donna Summer

**lapascalia** (9): That beat switch really took me by surprise, great song

**TiltControls** (8.7): stream deja vu ft. sia

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I just know popheads are gonna give this song shit cause of the intro, but the intro makes the song for me. I love that it's this one evolving glossy jam track.

**teenage\_meme** (8.5): this was too long for my taste, but i stan moroder and this is a wonderful tribute

**wardrum5** (8.5): this is such a bizarre "song" and I disliked it when it came out but now I really love it

**Hielord** (8.4): Like Mozart but for the future

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): giorgio an icon, literally invented disco. But I love the production on here, it’s amazing and very unique. It’s like watching a movie.

**grinchelda** (8): while i could do without the supervillain monologue which is neither evil nor sexy, the rest of the song goes off

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): give a pop music pioneer his due

**waluigiest** (8): I was ready to be mad about this but I kind of love it

**pisces\_king** (7.7): So long, and this is not fair but I want Robyn to sing over this somehow... there's a world where that works.

**letsallpoo** (7): i'll probably never listen to this again but it was fun!

**1998tweety** (6): the last quarter of this song is good but the rest is meh

**rickikardashian** (6): this is great but it has no business being 10 minutes long. [the musical assay](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291004511000985600/744970981487018085/emote.png)

**ImADudeDuh** (5): You know how in those old Schmoyoho autotune the news videos where the video starts with the beginning of the actual news story and then they add the instrumental under it and eventually just start autotuning and making the interview into a song? Yeah, that’s the song besides the autotuning part.

**CritneySpearz** (4): Really enjoyed from 8:00 or so until the end, but really wasn’t into the first few minutes with the speaking parts

**bespectacIed** (1): it's getting weird ...

**SmileAndTears** (0): I'm sorry but what the hell is this? The transitions are abrupt and random as hell, I'm not a fan of the spoken parts and it's overall not really interesting production wise. This also didn't need to be 8 minutes long

**camerinian** (10): It feels like the thing of comparing Young Thug to James Brown has kind of faded out recently, but in case you needed better evidence of that comparison, this song is the strongest possible case. His flow is tighter than it's ever been over this gorgeous, shimmering production, and his lines are just ridiculous enough for them to fit the fun, loose vibe without requiring too much overthinking. Pharrell and Ariana nail it too, but they're a garnish to the killer performance of Thugga and Calvin, and their chemistry is so on point.

**Steelstepladder** (9): Oh man this song makes me wish Young Thug was over brighter production more often. Pharrell sounds so full of life and Ariana highlights both of them so well. One of the best songs on the album for sure.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): My fave in the album, this is the perfect hot late night summer song. On paper, a song with thugger, pharrell, and ariana sounds like an obvious smash. In real life, it was

**cremeebrulee** (10): ariana and pharrell are magical together and i will not be convinced otherwise!

**lapascalia** (10): My only complaint is I wish Ari had an actual verse on this song… but this is still amazing

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): there are few songs that make me smile like this does... this sounds the way driving to the beach at 9am on a hot sunny morning with three of your best friends feels. sounds the way sunblock smells. sounds the way a pool float looks and a daiquiri tastes. you get the idea

**TiltControls** (10): best song on the album imo. I really do like Slide (I mean it still got a 10) but this track feels so full of life, especially with Pharrell shining on the chorus

**turtle-thief** (10): Serotonin.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Young Thug’s part I’m not fully sold on, but it doesn’t detract from the rest of the song. Ariana sound so breezy and Pharrell works too

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): tbh i don't really care for the first verse but the rest is great

**wardrum5** (9.3): If this dropped today it would debut at #1

**pisces\_king** (9.2): I love anything Ariana and this track is an immediate mood-booster. I'm always down for her to collab on something less dramatic pop or trap that she has been doing very well in her own stuff; her voice is very sweet on this and it's overall quite fun.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): This is more like a cold glass of lemonade. With SOME cocaine. But just a little bit. It won't get you addicted, but it's a good time, cold and refreshing.

**hunnybee12** (9): not ariana stealing the show with one line

**TragicKingdom1** (9): young thug has a ton of charisma as a performer at his full potential and this is great evidence of that

**vintagebathingsuit** (9): ooh, wow, this is a vibe. a perfect summer song. pharrell sounds great on this, love it. ariana sounds unexpectedly good on this beat, wish there was a little more of her and less young thug.

**Chevsapher** (8.6): An understated Ariana Grande feature AND a creative outro? Yes please.

**teenage\_meme** (8.5): i got so excited when ariana came in! i loved how her voice contrasted with the rest of the track.

**anothertown** (8): a low key bop. Ariana on the hook over that bassline is one of the smoothest moments in the rate.

**hikkaru** (8): it's nice but ari was ROBBED... the way she sounds absolutely heavenly but only sings for like 3 seconds

**skargardin** (8): overhated bop

**SmileAndTears** (8): I feel like Ariana could've done more vocally

**waluigiest** (8): this is extremely tied to the spring of 2018 for me

**rickikardashian** (7.8): young thug’s voice is highkey annoying but pharrel and ariana make up for it

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): all the song’s contributors kinda clash. but let’s get ariana on more funky tracks pls.

**sarcasticsobs** (7): ariana is the only good part for me

**vayyiqra** (7): I was not expecting to hear Awiana Gwande begin singing out of nowhere but I am for it

**grinchelda** (6.7): uhhhhh i liked the part when ariana

**bbfan132** (6.5): i wish i liked this more but i don’t remember most of it, ariana was just there and same with the other features

**1998tweety** (6): Honestly this is not good

**bulforster** (6): I like all the parts individually but they don't gel at all.

**pat-rickstar** (6): Young Thug doesn't sound good at times, and I wish Ariana had more than just the chorus because she was the best part of the song

**wavingwolves** (6): will this be massively overrated, i wonder

**ImADudeDuh** (5): “No toilet tissue, I shit on [n-word]s 'cause life is short (facts)” Wow this is a bad lyric. It’s even crazier coming from Ariana of all people.

**MrSwearword** (1): aged terribly and should've had people concerned once Pharrell was announced as part of Sweetener.

**camerinian** (9): Look it’s not like any of you are wrong about Camilla, but this is her best performance by quite a big margin in my books, and Mark is working his ass off to complement her more nasal tone with the shimmering production. I love the desperation that's spread throughout every aspect of this song, and the lyrics are kind of beautifully poetic too. But the best bit is the melodic shift in the chorus (pre-chorus? Idk, you know the bit, we all know the bit) It's just inspired choices like that that make this a really brilliant pop ballad from every facet

**Steelstepladder** (7): Never was a Camilla Cabello fan but this is probably her best song. Most Camilla is just so lifeless to me but Mark Ronson actually gives her interesting production and a strong hook so it all works very well.

---

**jexan13** (11): This was a hard 11, but this song is... I don't know how to say it. Perfect, amazing, beyond art? The melody and vocals are amazing and SO right. Any change that could have been made on this song would have made it worse. Later on, I discovered that Kevin Parker co-wrote it and... it makes so much sense that I ended up loving it, that guy is amazing.

**letsallpoo** (11): one night when i was really lonely i played this like 60 times and it made me feel lonelier 11/10 would do it again

**pisces\_king** (11): OK, let me first say that I cannot stand C*mila Cabello and I denounce almost anything and everything she's involved with. THAT SAID. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS EVER. I do not know what it is, but the chorus has some sort of effect on my brain chemistry, this song is an addictive substance and I am merely a vessel through which it courses.

**teenage\_meme** (11): my fave song of 2019! i'm not even a camila fan but this production is perfect. i'm obsessed with the wonky chord change on "tears in your eyes." it's like this song was made for me; i love everything about it. i could (and have) listen to it all day.

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece, camila ate

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Her best song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): legitimately the best song Camilla had ever done. Everything about this is perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): classic

**SmileAndTears** (10): Camila's best song

**rickikardashian** (9.8): -0.2 for “i go to therapy and it’s twice a week”

**hunnybee12** (9.5): truly camila’s best song

**lapascalia** (9.5): Everything Kevin Parker touches turns to gold

**pat-rickstar** (9): Not very disco-y but just a good synth-pop song

**rotating3Dtext** (9): the structure of this song makes me go feral

**vayyiqra** (9): We know you hate Camila, Popheads, but this is a really good song and I think it suits her

**Hielord** (8.7): U-shaped space in my bed, U-shaped thoughts inside my head is still one of the best lines of 2019, don't at me

**Chevsapher** (8.2): The second verse (?) is immaculate, and the chords are gorgeous. The vocal delivery is obnoxious, unfortunately.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): would be a 10 with literally anyone else singing

**grinchelda** (8): i kind of hate the prechorus vocals

**wavingwolves** (8): just found out the lyrics aren't "i try to pass the night away with somebody new but they don't have a shower that can compare to you" and i'm shocked and heartbroken </3

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): i think i'd like it a lot more with a different vocalist.

**bbfan132** (6): i like the melody sort of but it’s underwhelming for me; i know that it’s probably making day 3 though, oh well

**bulforster** (5.5): <insert Canola shade here>

**sarcasticsobs** (5): this is the ONLY song where i do not absolutely dislike her voice the ENTIRE time with her voice, like there’s nothing she can do about it, just straight up the sound doesn’t mesh with my ears

**anothertown** (3): the song is terrible and I was going through the popheads fresh thread because I remember it being full of praise, then I came upon the comment from Mark Ronson saying he was showing the thread to camila lol

**purplechilipepper** (3): dont

**bespectacIed** (0): my god, camila's voice really is a terrorist organization. The awful lyrics and the generic production (apparently the one kevin parker had a hand on??? Seriously???) contribute to this well-deserved 0

**MrSwearword** (0): NOPE. Camila doesn't need therapy, she needs singing lessons minimum.

**camerinian** (8.5): God, I love King Princess' voice. She's just effortlessly charismatic, simultaneously powerful and understated, casual yet bluntly honest. The fact that she's riding such a tight groove and being punctuated by the gorgeous vocal layering on the bridge is just icing on top of an incredible showcase of her talents. I honestly just wish there was more of this song, I could sit in it all day.

**Steelstepladder** (5): It breaks my heart to say this but King Princess is such a singles artist. I really want to love her but every album cut that she appears on just feels like filler to me :/

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Great mentor-protégé work from mark and kp. Love the bassline, the vocoders in the bridge, and the particular lyric "no matter which way you cut it, there's pieces of us"

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Hearing this was a very pleasant surprise, despite my dislike of KP, I really enjoyed this track

**1998tweety** (9.5): KP's best song

**jexan13** (9.5): It's very good but there something off. Perhaps it's the vocal delivery, that made this not reach its deserved perfection.

**Chevsapher** (9.1): I was initially impressed by the songwriting—then the drums kicked in and my jaw fell to the floor. What a track!

**pisces\_king** (9.1): I really am not a fan of Macy's heiress Kng Princess, like Cmila, but this song is beautiful!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this is better than any of her actual music tbh

**Hielord** (9): This song has such a unique feel to me, King Princess is so underrated. One of the best of the album

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Mark Ronson really does bring out the best of many of the artists here

**lapascalia** (9): I really like KP’s voice here

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the way i snuck king princess into another rate...my mind

**bbfan132** (8): i usually find king princess but this is a fun track! very catchy and groovy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Everytime we touch, I do get this feeling!

**SmileAndTears** (8): I love her voice so much

**vayyiqra** (8): I do not like King Princess but this is a nice ballad especially when the drums and slap bass come in

**wavingwolves** (8): this surely conveys a late night feeling

**oliveoilgarlic** (6): I can’t forget that this girl is literally the heir to the Macy’s fortune

**camerinian** (7.5): I really dig how this remix actually makes the original kind of sexier? Like, the original is more contemplative and conflicted, whereas this is super vibey and amplified the hornier aspects of the lyrics. I also don't think there's too much point in comparing because both versions are so different. This is just a groovy bop regardless and I dig what Calvin did here.

**Steelstepladder** (7): I like this quite a bit buuuuuuut the original is better. The original just had that longing that a dance remix just can't compete with despite how great on it's on this sounds.

---

**waluigiest** (11): I used to be lukewarm on this remix because I adore the original, but over time I’ve grown to love it so much. It feels completely different from the more weightless original, but this funky tale on it works and is such a jam.

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE bop, should've been a SMASHA

**hunnybee12** (10): amazing in any form

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I prefer the original but this is a vibe

**ImADudeDuh** (10): CTRL was robbed in that rate

**lapascalia** (10): In my mind a funky remix of this song shouldn’t work but it’s delicious

**MrSwearword** (10): I am all in favor of this

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): SZA sounds amazing over this kind of beat, where is her chill funky album at

**pat-rickstar** (10): That bassline ughhh, I want another SZA x Calvin collab or just another funk song like this from SZA

**pisces\_king** (10): GODDDDDDD I LOVE THIS SONG! The original is stellar, and I would give the original a 10, too. This version does something else to me, though, it is NEVER something I skip. I am so happy it exists.

**rickikardashian** (10): not giving this my 11 was a painful choice, but a necessary one

**skargardin** (10): this BETTER be top five at the very least or else

**wavingwolves** (10): the og is still the best but this goes off

**vintagebathingsuit** (9.5): one of my favourite SZA songs, i forgot this remix existed.

**bbfan132** (9): this song is an easy 10 but i prefer the original production and this doesn’t fit the song as well so i have to dock a point

**bulforster** (9): Servicable (if a bit unnecessary) remix of a great song.

**grinchelda** (9): sza queen of sharing

**lostonthewayh0me** (9): better than the original imo!

**sarcasticsobs** (9): ah yes, sad bop hours

**Chevsapher** (7.5): The backing track is great, but it doesn't interface much with the actual song. Sorry, y'all, but I'm not feeling this one.

**anothertown** (7): this is nice and the cover art is nice but RIP the timberlake samples

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh I just didn't comment on this one huh yeah I guess its fine? idk

**vayyiqra** (7): I like SZA but feel like the only one who doesn't get the hype over this song by her it's fine I guess and this remix is fine too

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): It's ok, I prefer the original

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): This kinda does nothing for me other than making me want to listen to the original

**Hielord** (5.2): Forgettable. SZA voice saved this song to have a lower score for me.

**bespectacIed** (2): electric chair to calvin for doing a funky remix to a super moody song. What tf was he thinking??? CTRL is a 10/10 album, just wanna mention

**Steelstepladder** (9): While I might not like this quite as much as some people have been hyping up I would be stupid to say this isn't one of the best songs in the rate. Angel Olsen is so underappreciated as a singer and knows how to elevate what would be otherwise good songs into great songs

**camerinian** (8): Truth be told, at the beginning I was not sure at all why y'all were so dead set on this being a favourite for the rate, since the impact of the track seems like it wasn't particularly massive compared to the rest of the album. I do really like it though, Angel Olsen's subdued, almost grumbled vocal over the verses definitely sounds surprisingly good over the soft rock grooves, and it contrasts really nicely with the higher register of the chorus, and I do think there's a lot of emotional potency in the chorus. I guess it just doesn't strike me much deeper than that, I can see the appeal and fully get it, it just doesn't get all the way there. Maybe I wish it went a bit bigger is all? Anyway y'all love sad dancefloor bops so no surprises this did so well

---

**bespectacIed** (11): Yeah how could I not give my 11 to this beauty. The upbeat twin of Chance, aka the best song on All Mirrors, and the most heartbreaking song of all time. Two perfect songs, telling a parallel story of passion and disillusionment and impossible love. Whereas Chance is made for drinking wine on your bed while wallowing, True Blue is for drunk-crying on the dancefloor. I love this song an unhealthy amount, one of the most beautiful songs ever

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): one of my top 10 songs of 2019 and one of the best of the decade period. I lost my shit when Angel did this as an encore when I saw her in November, and it has an extra nostalgia because that was my last show pre-covid. it’s just heartbreaking and a perfect blend of retro and disco and modern and just... incredible

**sarcasticsobs** (11): not a moment’s hesitation in giving this the eleven

**bbfan132** (10): so i was calling this overrated a week ago but this has grown on me immensely - i love angel’s artsier/folksier tracks but she sounds just as good on a disco/more standard pop track like this. i’d love to hear more songs like this from her!

**grinchelda** (10): i was as surprised to find out there was an angel olsen feature on this album as i was unsurprised i love it

**Hielord** (10): Pure art

**hunnybee12** (10): thank you for this gift angel 🙏🏻

**jexan13** (10): I'm quite sure that when Mark and Angel made this song they knew what kind of amazing tune they were releasing. This is absolutely amazing and a runner up for my 11. Holy molly, that intro, those drums, those VOCALS. I want Mark Ronson to produce the next Angel Olsen's album. I'll chop heads if this isn't top 5.

**lapascalia** (10): Well I see why people love this song… it’s actually great

**pisces\_king** (10): Probably the most effective, exciting sad bop on this album of sad bops.

**skargardin** (10): angelic

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): this is so blissful and beautiful, the beat and the gentle vocals...loving this.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): God this sounds soooo sad, I love it

**1998tweety** (9): ascending

**Chevsapher** (9): How does one album have so much killer production?

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Why do I get Angel Olsen and Ansel Elgort's names mixed up help

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Hey, this is now my favorite Angel Olsen song! It's also one of the few I'd score above a 6!

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't really like the filter on Angel's voice but that's a nitpick. This is a really good song. I wish I could give it a higher score though because she deserves it.

**teenage\_meme** (7.5): i like the song, but her vocals were unpleasant to me, sorry

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i searched “true blue” on youtube to try and find songs named “true blue” to say that are better than this and this youtube video, uploaded a day ago with 0 views somehow popped up in the top suggestions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdV_NaPCM68

**anothertown** (5): is this really seen as the highlight of the album? Angel “Music for TERFs” Olsen?

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): sounds like urban outfitters. nice dreamy chord changes tho

**MrSwearword** (4): the lyrics and production are cute but the singer is awful here

**waluigiest** (4): just a bloated angel Olsen song but it’s not very good. Next

**purplechilipepper** (3): washed out production and washed out vocals mark why

**Steelstepladder** (10): One of the best songs of the last decade period

**camerinian** (7): For real this might be the most overrated song of the 2010s but it's still a nice, angry tune that hits when it does hit. There's also just a shit load more femme-punk and singer-songwriter stuff that scratches that itch better for me, and it sure as shit isn't unique in that regard

**Steelstepladder** (6): I lied this at the time but in hindsight this is actually on the weaker side of the album and that's weird to me. Katy Perry is fine on it but she really doesn't kill the chorus in the same way other songs on the album do. Pharrell is good here but I prefer his performance on Heatstroke tbh.

**camerinian** (5.5): Welp, guess this is now an unpopular opinion. I never really cared for this track and was quite disappointed that this was a bigger single than Heatstroke. As legendary as Pharrell is, he's got better performances just on this very album, Big Sean is kinda phoning it in too, and Katy especially sounds bored over this beat that doesn't even really suit her. I don't mind the kind of Ace of Base thing that the production is doing, but it's a lot more rigid than the best on the album and it's really not a highlight for me.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): yeah this was song of the summer for me in 2017. It’s the perfect summer song. Sure it’s a little corny but katy sound amazing here and it’s just so catchy and fun.

**wardrum5** (11): Should have been an absolute smash. My favorite Big Sean verse. The fourth wave of ska is coming

**1998tweety** (10): Love it, should've been a hit (Katy deserved it)

**bespectacIed** (10): Aww, the only good thing that come out of 2017 for katherine

**CrimsonROSET** (10): The best thing Katy put out that year, and she had a whole album. And she's still the worst part in it!

**lapascalia** (10): Another summer jam. I also actually really like Big Sean’s verse here

**lostonthewayh0me** (10): katy has never sounded so good

**MrSwearword** (10): I could've been truthful and knock this down by four for that tacky and dumb pills line, but considering the slop Katy's put out, I'll take her four seconds of chorus and RUN. Also the song has aged better than I remembered.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I still hear this on the radio fairly often but I'm not mad, the instrumental is the best on the album, and the three vocalists fit well together

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): iconic tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Everything about this track works, it was a great first single, and perfectly captures "Funk Wav Bounces"

**rickikardashian** (10): im just saying…. as much as i love this…… it better not end up higher than Slide, the superior single

**skargardin** (10): boppy

**turtle-thief** (10): I was so shocked katy collabed with someone outside her own records (past 2014) and the result is amazing.

**grinchelda** (9.9): i really don't like the first like thirty seconds of the first verse but wow i love this song. fully blame katy perry for how bad i've got it rn. big sean absolutely killed it

**pisces\_king** (9.9): One of the best hooks I've ever heard. Calvin Harris's production on this lends itself so perfectly to the sunny, California sound that I associate with the very best of Katy's catalogue.

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): loses a point for Big Sean but god what a bop. that “wooo!” at the beginning is perfect

**wavingwolves** (9): music in 2017 was great and so was life

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The writing is clunky, but the bridge is memorable and the production is peak Calvin.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): A bop

**vintagebathingsuit** (8.5): this is lovely, really catchy. katy sounds nice on it. big sean's verse is great.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): katy served tbh

**bbfan132** (8): pharrell, katy, and big sean all made this fun to listen to, really enjoyed the tropical vibes here that were utilized in a unique way

**Hielord** (8): It's a chill bop

**ImADudeDuh** (8): a summer smash

**teenage\_meme** (8): "catch feels" is such an embarrassing lyric, but this song is undeniably summery and fun

**waluigiest** (8): this song is bad. But I do like it because I like trash

**sarcasticsobs** (7): no doubt-ass sounding song (a good thing)

**anothertown** (6): I feel like this song is good right up until sean comes in and then it’s just a parody of itself and this entire project

**vayyiqra** (6): I know that feel bro

**letsallpoo** (0): nobody sounds remotely bearable on this

**static\_int\_husp** (0): one of my least favorite Katy Perry choruses. Pharell's choruses don;t really measure up either.

**camerinian** (10): What a perfect piece of pop music. Julian Casablancas is just a brilliant fit for this style of production, and it makes you wish he’d incorporate it more in his own music. His vocals are forlorn and achingly beautiful, and the vocoder effects only amplify how almost precisely broken they are. The vocal melodies on this song really do soar over the more subdued yet punchy chord progressions and the groove on this song hits the sweet spot of funky yet melancholic that everyone on this sub seems like they can’t resist, as evidenced by the very deserved high placement of this song.

**Steelstepladder** (10): This might not be my favorite song in this rate but this might be the song I've listened to the most. I was a huge Strokes fan in highschool and when I found out Julian Casablancas had a song with Daft Punk I lost my mind. Still holds up extremely well years later.

---

**lostonthewayh0me** (11): one of my favourite songs of all time. the chorus gives me chills everytime, even though i don't understand what is being said half the time. the power!

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): sad gay noises

**SideBTrack8** (11): stan Julian Casablancas

**bespectacIed** (10): i'm ashamed to admit, this is aptly titled to me because julian WAS my "white boy who looks like he only sleeps 2 hours a night and does drugs" crush 😭. The very last video where he still looked *somehow* dorky cute before aging like milk like every white rock star in history. Oh, and this song is excellent lol.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Right, but that guitar solo? Can we talk about that for a bit longer?

**Hielord** (10): Iconic. Still the most confusing lyrics of all time.

**jexan13** (10): I was SO obsessed with this when it came out.

**pisces\_king** (10): Simply divine. Simply. DIVINE.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): did i give it a 10 because i saw “julian casablancas” or did i actually listen? you’ll never know

**vayyiqra** (10): I feel like I could write a thinkpiece about something millennials online dating ghosting culture about this song but it's perfect the way it is and doesn't need any interpretation because loneliness is an emotion we all understand :pensive:

**wavingwolves** (10): this is my second 11 contender for this rate and i would like to apologize to it since we've been through so much together.... i'm sorry i won't give the 11 to you, you're still great

**lapascalia** (9.5): A beautifully bittersweet song

**Chevsapher** (9): The song itself isn't perfect, but the production is excellent. The lead synth in the chorus feels like a hug, and those guitars in the bridge have such a unique texture.

**grinchelda** (8.7): i feel like everybody else likes this more than i do, by which i mean i mostly just like the second verse

**1998tweety** (8.5): This Julian person kind of ate

**bbfan132** (8.5): julian casablancas sounds v cool with the autotune!

**rickikardashian** (8.5): last christmas I gave you my heart

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Bopity bop

**teenage\_meme** (8): the guitar is very sexy

**turtle-thief** (8): I thought i liked this song and i do, but that falsetto annoyed the fuck out of me, and after rating "Lose Yourself" i realised this should be lower.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): The Less I Know The Better found dead in a coke dusted studio

**waluigiest** (7): last Christmas I gave you my heart

**anothertown** (6): song is kind of a bop but I just found out that Julian Casablancas came from an extremely wealthy family and met all of the Strokes at prep schools.. I’m not a fan but does all of music have to be a lie like that

**bulforster** (6): The chorus is good but the rest doesn't do much for me.

**MrSwearword** (6): the chorus is fine but the song itself kind of doesn't go anywhere, sorryboutit

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Well, idk.

**camerinian** (7.5): I'll be honest, it took me a little while to decide how I felt about this song. Maybe I wasn't wild about Lykke Li's wispiness for most of the song, aside from the obvious power of the "on and on and on" bit. I also wasn't crazy about the tinnier elements in the production, but I dunno, something clicked with the way it builds into the end of the chorus and by the end of the song where everything is in full blast. I did come around to it, and the fantastic video very much helped in that.

**Steelstepladder** (7): It's good but I find it a bit weird that this is the song the entire album is named after. It kind of just seems like another track to me that doesn't really stand out of it's own.

---

**bbfan132** (10): i remember being surprised to see lykke li on a mark ronson track but she’s perfect here, the mix of disco and sophisti-pop here hits that sweet spot for me

**bespectacIed** (10): this is fuckinggg gorgeous. I wish the album sounded more like this

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this deserved to be a global smash

**hunnybee12** (10): on&on&on&on

**jexan13** (10): The vocals and instrumentals are like soft silk made music

**lapascalia** (10): So smooth and groovy, love it. Also, Lyyke Li really reminds me of Banks here, which is a great thing imo.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): shit now i’m sad already god damn

**skargardin** (10): this is a massive vibe

**vayyiqra** (10): I love Lykke and her emotional voice and how this is a vintage disco bop I just love everything about this and the vibe it creates

**pisces\_king** (9.8): Lykke Li's voice coasts beautifully, skimming over the bass and then taking us up into the sky on the chorus. The title track, this obviously encapsulates the album's late night, lusty and melancholic ethos.

**anothertown** (9): this would have played in a disco scene in The Get Down (RIP) just so smooth from start to finish

**CrimsonROSET** (9): A good album opener! Nothing comes before this!

**teenage\_meme** (9): love the classic disco melody when she sings "on and on"

**1998tweety** (8.5): pretty

**vintagebathingsuit** (8.5): great bassline and vocals, really slick and fun and catchy.

**Chevsapher** (8): Steel drums? A tempo change mid-song? “The Hustle” vibes? Perhaps the parts are stronger than the whole, but this production is fascinating.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): The second half is :chef_kiss:

**MrSwearword** (7): the Jax Jones remix is better than this but it's not bad.

**wavingwolves** (7): not a fan of the verses but the chorus is great and so is that little breakdown

**waluigiest** (4): not offensive but it lacks anything interesting to me

**purplechilipepper** (3): I just don't get why he started the album with two of these

**Steelstepladder** (10): I've never been a huge Miley fan but this might be the best thing she's ever done. She sounds so good over this country-esc production it's not even funny. I must have listened to this a billion times since it released and I'm sure I'll listen to it a billion times more.

**camerinian** (9.5): I just adore the grandiosity of this track. Those opening strings are epic in their orchestration, and Miley walloping in with the main chorus lyric is a brilliant way to start. The country twang on the guitar suits Miley incredibly, as we well know, and plowing everything back into that fantastic chorus with imagery of thunder crashing and records spinning on loop is massive. This track really is in a class of its own, and the last minute surge it made up to this position really reflects how well that bombast resonated with the sub

---

**1998tweety** (11): one of Miley's best songs, her voice suits this style so good

**pat-rickstar** (11): When this song hits, it HITS for me. I love the strings, Miley's vocals, everything about it actually. I need more country-disco in my life!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This was my 11 before I heard RAM, this was my song of the year for a hot minute.

**grinchelda** (10): miley features just get me

**hikkaru** (10): this was done absolutely dirty on the hot 100 it's so boppy

**ignitethephoenix** (10): excellence

**ImADudeDuh** (10): deserved better

**lostonthewayh0me** (10): favourite track off the album. miley sounds great and the chorus is stunning.

**MrSwearword** (10): I've warmed a great deal to this song despite it having Miley Cyrus on it. Despite that, the song by itself divorced from the singer on it is pretty catchy. Also, the Don Diablo remix is a serve.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): miley really was born to sing this song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song really grew on me, Miley is the perfect feature for it, and I love how cinematic it feels

**rickikardashian** (10): this truly didn’t get the recognition it deserved

**skargardin** (10): The best miley's sounded in years

**TiltControls** (10): Miley shines on this song! Very close 11 contender

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i love country music

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): this is the only good thing milky cyst did the entire 2010s decade

**lapascalia** (9.5): This style really suits Miley, she sounds amazing here

**pisces\_king** (9.4): A great pop song, Miley was the perfect choice for this; she brings a certain Americana feel with her voice and presence and this song is an instant classic.

**bbfan132** (9): definitely one of miley’s best songs, she sounds way better on a country disco track than she did on younger now’s bland country pop tracks

**Chevsapher** (9): I like this song more every time I hear it. Disco-country us such an underutilized genre combination, and this track does it so well.

**cremeebrulee** (9): i always thought this song was just ok for the longest time but after listening thru this album i understand the appeal-- its a standout from a very slow album lmfao

**vintagebathingsuit** (9): miley should return to this sound at some point, it really works for her. she sounds so good on this.

**anothertown** (8.5): I’m about to become an NBLAH truther bc I just now suddenly love this. Things Fall Apart but Nothing Breaks Like a Heart!! Chinua Achebe who??

**Hielord** (8.5): Give me those old west vibes baby

**jexan13** (8.5): This sound like a hymn with those strings. Nice, but doesn't get more because I don't feel it fits too much in the album.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): music to shoot pool in a dive bar and plan your revenge on your ex (or the person who killed your ex) to

**purplechilipepper** (8): conflicted because it's a great song but there are a couple elements that kinda take me out of the album experience

**sarcasticsobs** (8): western disco, baybee

**teenage\_meme** (8): a lil twangy for me

**waluigiest** (8): it’s no malibu

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): This is decent but Kacey did disco-country better

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah this song is going to place highly because it's catchy and because Popheads loves Miley Cyrus, but something about it makes me not love it. (Okay, it's the country vibes.) It's just not as disco or as :pensive: as the rest of the album, and that specific combination is why I like the album in the first place. It's still good though

**wavingwolves** (6): country disco is where it's at but i don't think this is as great as everyone says it is

**bespectacIed** (5): still not sure if i like this tbh. Does this disco party in a Texas barn kinda work, or do I just have a soft spot for miley? Either way I love that this is the "album cover track"

**camerinian** (9.5): For a time early on, this was your number one, so if you were really rooting for this one, well, you know who to speak to. It's not exactly hard to see why this was pegged as a favourite though, since it's one of the most likeable hit songs to have worked its way up the charts throughout the whole of the 2010s. If you don't at least respect this, I really have to wonder what went wrong. The groove is potent from the first notes, Nile Rodgers is as good as he's ever been, Pharrell is effortlessly charismatic, and the jam band feel of the production is just marvelous. If you listen to the full album version, the moment the whole mix drops in is a thing of wonder. A very deserved podium finish tbh

**Steelstepladder** (8): Gotta be honest and say I might have overplayed this myself a touch too much when it came out for me to like it like I once did but it's still an extremely hype disco track that rightfully still gets airplay years later.

---

**bbfan132** (11): this might be the easy 11 choice but the song is excellent, pharrell is one of the best modern producers and he gets too much hate from pure pop stans on this site. nile rodgers is a legendary producer/guitarist who helped make disco the legendary genre it is and he is still underappreciated! listen to more of their songs please, everyone (and participate in the disco rate)

**MrSwearword** (11): DUH this is getting the grand prize. It's the best song in the rate.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I mean, out of all the songs in this rate, this has had the most cultural impact and I think it’s deserved

**TragicKingdom1** (11): one of the most universal-feeling songs of all time if that makes sense. the grammys performance of this is like a top 2 televised performance for me

**1998tweety** (10): i gave this a 10 so now i dont feel bad for dragging the rest of the album

**anothertown** (10): https://i.imgur.com/P8vnyZi.jpg

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Honestly, the only thing I'm taking away from this listen is that I didn't remember this song was 6 minutes long.

**Hielord** (10): A deserved hit song about mexican lucky

**hunnybee12** (10): my childhood dog was named lucky so it was fun to hear this on the radio at the time… rip lucky </3

**jexan13** (10): Perfect. That's it

**lapascalia** (10): It’s a modern classic

**lostonthewayh0me** (10): a classic.

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): this is a Chic song. fucking stan Chic

**pat-rickstar** (10): Look, I know it was inescapable back in 2013 but I don't think this song will ever get old to me. I'm just a sucker for that riff

**pisces\_king** (10): Another perfect song, you do not get much better than this.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): maybe i like pharrell williams after all?

**rickikardashian** (10): im trying to find flaws in this to justify tanking its score so my 11 will win

**skargardin** (10): Still slaps as hard as it did on release day

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes this song is repetitive and long. Yes we know you hate Pharrell. I don't care. This is a bop. It's a jam. It slaps, it goes off, it (no pun intended) absolutely fucks. This is not a song about partying and sex. It's a song about nostalgia for that youthful feeling of exuberance and joy that you'll look back on one day and wish you'd valued more at the time ... if you spent your formative years hating this song instead of looking past how overplayed it is, and simply having fun. We're up all night to get lucky we're up all night to get lucky we're up all night to get lucky we're up all night to get lucky [x8000 until the apocalypse]

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): one of the best songs of the decade. i will never not adore this song.

**waluigiest** (10): I was enamored by this song when it came out. I used to think it was out of place on the album, but now I know in context it really fits the vibe and style. It’s impressive how it balances that while being distinctly more earwormy and radio friendly

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): A classic bop

**TiltControls** (9.2): Good song, but a little bit overrated

**Chevsapher** (8.6): I really do like this song, but I heard it so much back when it was on the radio that I'm still tired of it. The vocoder portions are still incredible, though.

**hikkaru** (8.5): sometimes i'm like wow i don't like this song it's too repetitive but then i listen to it and i have no choice but to bop a bit and feel the nostalgia for 2013

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): a classic but too long again

**bespectacIed** (8): It was good when it wasn't overplayed to death yet

**ImADudeDuh** (8): if we did this rate in 2015, this song would win with a 10.5 average (ignore the fact that the other 2 albums weren’t released at that point)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): The song is incredibly iconic, but unfortunately overplay really killed this song for me

**sarcasticsobs** (7): never reaaally got into this

**wavingwolves** (6): the instrumental version of this is better

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): okay listen I’ve always disliked this song, but my ex LOVED this song (and whole album) and would talk incessantly about it and I just have a lot of additional resentment towards it because he was a waste of a year of my love life. learned to care for the rest of the album despite him tho

**Steelstepladder** (11): During the last two days of results slide vaulted into first and it deserved it. While I thoroughly enjoy True Blue and Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, this is a no brainer for me as Slide is the best song in this rate, and the song that made me completely change my opinion on Calvin Harris in general. One of the best songs of the 2010's hands down.

**camerinian** (10): Well done to every single comment that accurately called this as the winner. Though the contest between Get Lucky and this was close in the early stages, by the last day of submissions, there was no contest, and Slide, well, slid clear into the #1 position. The reasons for this being predicted as the winner are obvious, almost as obvious as the universal appeal of this song. Not only was this the first single of Calvin’s bold swerve into funk, but it also brought in two of the most critically acclaimed acts of the decade and mashed them into an unlikely trio that caught everyone by surprise. 

Further to that, it plays to every single act’s strengths. Frank Ocean is allowed to still play contemplative and dig for depth beyond the flash, whereas Quavo and Offset revel in it through perhaps some of their tightest flows. But the star of this is Calvin Harris himself, delivering one of his most effortlessly charming productions. The piano intro is fantastic in its simplicity, the lead synth line is unmistakable, the bass line is brilliantly bouncy and unwavering, and all of the little accents he peppers in from Frank and Migos are placed precisely and exquisitely. This is a magnificent song, it was personally one of my most listened to songs in 2017 and 18, and it's going to stay around for a long while, I get the feeling. Magnificent, and well-deserved as your winner.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): the college semester this song came out, i was at one of my happiest so of course this song is my 11. it's such a serotonin rush and i will never tire of it <3

**grinchelda** (11): really glad i now have this song in my back pocket next time i pretend to like frank ocean to impress someone cooler than me

**hikkaru** (11): s11ide wbk

**hunnybee12** (11): the official song of the summer for the rest of eternity

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this being the first song on the rate….. Just give ha the crown already. This rate already peaked.

**lapascalia** (11): It’s a summer banger that never gets old

**purplechilipepper** (11): listen this has been my song of the summer for like three years running okay

**rickikardashian** (11): i would write an essay explaining myself but like……. how could i not give this an 11. just perfection.

**wavingwolves** (11): i think summer didn't even exist before this song

**1998tweety** (10): Okay this is perfection

**anothertown** (10): all time collab, all time album opener, I’m in my late 20s so I don’t really have “summers” anymore but if I concentrate while listening to this I can remember what hot asphalt feels like

**bbfan132** (10): such a breezy intro to the album, frank is perfect here!

**bespectacIed** (10): Starting the rate with the winner contender already. But food for thought, Slide has been overrated only because this is Frank doing a top 40-sounding song, on his off year, after releasing the most hyped album of the 2010s

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I am NOT giving this my 11 but I wouldn't be surprised or upset if it wins.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a classic. Also the best thing Migos has ever done

**lostonthewayh0me** (10): such a smooth track. perfect summer song.

**MrSwearword** (10): a track where Frank Ocean sounds invested is rare, so reward it when it happens, I say.

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): this was the first breath of fresh air we got in 2017. also shoutout to Frank for sneaking a reference to cruising into a top 40 pop song

**pisces\_king** (10): This song was an example of perfect pop; within 8 seconds of my very first listen, I remember being like holy shit, this is everything. The beat drops and it's just an undeniable bop. To get Frank on this makes it chef's KISS! I would give this an 11 if there wasn't another song on this rate that I love more than this somehow.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): anything below a 10 is a coward’s score

**skargardin** (10): It was a reset

**TiltControls** (10): classic for a good reason. I never thought Frank Ocean could kill it on a disco-style track before this but he sure proved me wrong. Though all of the track's collaborators did well

**TragicKingdom1** (10): my winner prediction for this rate, and i would be quite content with that!

**waluigiest** (10): Frank is everything to me, and this track shows off his versatility so well. The blend of analog and digital along with his beautiful vocals..... next level

**wardrum5** (10): This is winning the rate, obviously

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): "empty my bank account, and buy that Boy with a Pipe" is such a weirdly specific lyric i don't know how to feel about it

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): kinda overrated but sometimes hits

**SmileAndTears** (9): God that sample is annoying, still good tho

**Chevsapher** (8.8): Warning—listening to this song may cause you to experience vivid flashbacks to summer 2017.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): The high-pitched sample is annoying, but the actual song is pretty great

**vayyiqra** (8): I can vibe with this and also all the Picasso references in the lyrics (I'm a fan of cubism)

**Hielord** (7.8): A good bop for sure, not crazy for it tho

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): ooh, funky beat. love the bassline. didn't really go anywhere, though. not a huge fan of the vocals.

**PointlessBibliophage** (5.5): i'm sorry for not putting this higher but my ears kinda really really LOATHE the high pitched voice gimmick

**CreepyMannequin** (5): I never heard this song when it was big and I’m pretty underwhelmed after all the hype

steelstepladder: # Late Night Feelings

---

**Overall Average**: 7.549 **// Average Controversy:** 1.757

---

 This score from me is extremely low but it's just do to the filler and is not indicative of the overall experience. The highs on this thing are so damn good that it's a shame that there are two (actually arguably 3) too many YEBBA songs on this thing.

---
**lapascalia** (8.885): So I was clearly living under a rock in 2019 because I had never even heard one song from this album… doing this rate, I was going into this basically having no expectations. Boy was I blown away by all of these songs, what an amazing album with a cohesive theme and sound all the way through.

**SmileAndTears** (8.577): I really love this album, It's probably my favorite album from last year. This is for me what Melodrama is for a lot of people, it's the "I'm kinda feeling down so I'll put this on" type of album. It's an album I can listen from front to back without feeling the need to skip a song, even the ones I don't like that much. That being said, It's extremely backloaded, the Miley Cyrus collaboration feels out of place in this album and it could've used 1 or 2 less YEBBA tracks.

**vayyiqra** (8.154): I am really glad we got to rate this excellent and sorely underappreciated album. When it dropped last year I admit I listened to it mainly because it heavily features Lykke Li, who I am a big stan of. But also Mark is a great producer and I highly respect him, and there are a bunch of other great collaborations too. Finally, I just generally fuck with the concept of disco songs about feelings. In its own way, I think this is a very strong album and almost as good as Random Access Memories is.

**Hielord** (7.815): Severely underrated album with some hidden gems. Mark Ronson is an amazing producer.

**skargardin** (7.385): This has a couple highs but is very uneven in enjoyment for me. There are only a handful of songs I truly love and the rest I don't really care for. The concept is good I just wish that they had done more with it and that it was a bit more cohesive.

**bulforster** (7.269): This is competently made and there are definitely standouts but the fact that there are so many vocalists singing somewhat generic lyrics leaves you with a colder and more impersonal experience than the title suggests.

**brenda\_official** (6.923): yebba ruined the album

**pat-rickstar** (6.615): This album has some great highs, but some low lows as well. I haven't done many rates yet but this is the first where my 0 and my 11 came from the same album. There are some album tracks here that I will definitely revisit as I only knew the singles before this rate, but it's understandable that they weren't singles seeing as King Princess and Angel Olsen aren't as well known as the likes of Miley and Camila.

**oliveoilgarlic** (6.615): Uptown Special was better

**bespectacIed** (6.462): Mark striking both sides of the talent spectrum by having both camila and angel olsen in an album, that's range! There's a great retro-concept album somewhere inside this. At the end of the day mark is still a pop producer, he still had to include terrible, generic songs

**ImADudeDuh** (6.154): well i guess i don’t like yebba 💀💀💀

**waluigiest** (5.231): must confess this is one of my least favorite albums that I’ve rated on this sub. Its so lifeless.

steelstepladder: # Random Access Memories

---

**Overall Average**: 7.437 **// Average Controversy:** 1.986

---

 Oooooo I like this one a lot. The only reason why these scores aren't higher is because I tend to grade on a harsh curve but to me this well deserved the Grammy for Album of the Year

---
**PointlessBibliophage** (9.192): I'm unfortunately a Swiftie so first, an obligatory JUSTICE FOR RED. But that being said, this is an amazing album with an absolutely gorgeous sound that completely deserved every award it got. The twists, the turns, the bop after bop after bop... I love it. Objectively better than the other two albums in this rate.

**Hielord** (8.823): The complete album is a life-changing experience, it's like every track is a different movie that plays in my head every time I listen to it. They are the kings of what they do, and they do know how to do it.

**vayyiqra** (8.538): I love this album. I love Daft Punk. I have since I was a child, in fact, when they were the first electronic music I ever liked. I love that this won album of the year and the heartwarming moment when the two of them hugged each other like brothers, which they are. I love that they are best friends who just chill and wear robot masks and drop an amazing album every decade or so, when they feel inspired to do so. This album was an event and it fully deserved the praise it got.

**skargardin** (8.462): This was such a good release and so far away from the dubstep that ruled the airways back when it came out.. come back kings i miss you dearly..

**bulforster** (8.000): The first half, though it has its standouts, can be a bit hard to get through but from Touch onwards everything is pretty stellar. The lyrics work a lot better when they're reflecting on the power of music than the attempts at emotion, Touch and Fragments of Time get by on the expressiveness of the guest singers' vocals.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.962): Nile Rodgers invented disco pop Daft Punk are just living in his world

**pat-rickstar** (7.654): This has my highest average score of the 3 albums by some way, which is unsurprising. This is a really consistent album if nothing else, because the tracks I rated lowest aren't bad per se, just kind of there. Going into this rate only knowing Get Lucky from this album, I was impressed.

**waluigiest** (7.538): no offense but this album just sounds like that guy from vine who would make his Mii sing things like “I am gay and I wake up cryyyyyying”

**turtle-thief** (6.969): I remember liking this album back in 2013 and i'm sure it inspired a lot of amazing music we have today, but for an album that is prefaced by a "there's no rules in music" speech, it feels like it's sleepwalking. You know how new game consoles and graphics cards release tech demos to show how powerful and beautiful they can render graphics? This album is like a tech demo for synthesizers. If you took out the 4 main songs (we know which ones, they're literally next to each other), you will be left with a skillfully crafted just okay project.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.846): I feel bad because this is clearly a good album but it was really not for me. I understand why it won all the awards, at points it feels like a love letter to music itself, but on a whole, I was just underwhelmed. Call me when daft punk makes something as good as this icon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw6u6YkTgQ4

**SmileAndTears** (6.769): I can't say I was impressed by this album. I think I was expecting more from this because of all the critical acclaim and awards this album got but it had a lot of duds and a few songs went on for waaaay too long. This album also suffers from the same problems Chromatica and Jack Antonoff as a producer (to a certain extent) have : after a while, the album starts to blend together because every song has very similar production. Unfortunately I don't love Daft Punk's production. I don't hate it either but after a while the album becomes background music for me. I will say though, the highlights are pretty great and I could see myself revisiting certain songs from this album in the future + Get Lucky is a timeless song.

**bespectacIed** (6.000): And the grammy goes to RRRRRRRRneither red nor RAM, when good kid maad city deserved. I enjoyed many songs in this album, but RAM and Daft Punk in general are soooo fucking overpraised. I'll never get the hype for these two french weirdos. Although I do admit Digital Love is one of the most important songs made by humankind

**NapsAndNetflix** (5.923): WHY is 90% of this album just random need for speed underground 2 background music

**brenda\_official** (5.615): this album is ok, but it just feels so...slow? The songs are all so long but most of them are way too slow to dance to, I just don’t get the appeal

**CreepyMannequin** (5.385): I’ll probably be called tasteless for this but I just did not get this album.

steelstepladder: # Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1

---

**Overall Average**: 7.399 **// Average Controversy:** 1.846

This is the album whos singles stand on their own the strongest. Maybe it's because we've been going through the least Summery Summer in my lifetime but this album just hits so well right now, even past the singles.

---
**lapascalia** (9.417): This man did a masterful job with this album, what an incredible list of collaborators he got together. I really hope he’ll do a volume 2 one day!

**wardrum5** (9.008): Most slept on album of the DECADE and Vol. 2 is needed asap

**purplechilipepper** (8.417): these scores are gonna be high sorry I seriously love this album

**oliveoilgarlic** (8.208): PERFECT summer soundtrack

**waluigiest** (7.833): drop volume 2 sis

**skargardin** (7.750): He did what he had to but HOW are you gonna name your album Vol. 1 and not follow up with more volumes?

**sarcasticsobs** (7.583): i swear it’s like the same beat for the first half why?? it gets old after a while. still a good record though

**ImADudeDuh** (7.417): the album with the highest highs in this rate

**SmileAndTears** (7.250): I liked the album, although sometimes it felt more like a (very good) spotify playlist than an album. I feel like this is an album that works better in the context of a party or something like that. I thought the autotune was sometimes misused and ruined some potentially amazing tracks (looking at you Skrt On Me) but overall I thought the production was great!

**pat-rickstar** (6.917): I do think the concept of fusing funk and rap is an interesting one, but the quality of the performances from the guest rappers is hit and miss for me. I prefer the tracks like Feels which have the chorus sung by a singer, with the rap coming in for the bridge. Nicki does both of these parts well on Skrt On Me though.

**bespectacIed** (6.917): The melding of two black genres, the old and new, funk and hip-hop, is such a foolproof concept. I just wish it wasn't a white guy at the helm of this project lol. But this is really a fun, feel-good summer album, kudos to Taylor's ex!

**Hielord** (6.825): Best Calvin Harris era. Still mourning FWB Vol. 2, sob

**vayyiqra** (6.583): We come to it at last ... the great battle of our time ... I finally force myself to listen to a Calvin Harris album, that is. I have nothing against him, he has some bops, he's just never interested me all that much as an artist. This album is very okay. I like nu disco, I like old disco (which contrary to his facetious claims, he did not create).. He is a good producer. Still, I feel like this is the weakest album in this rate and does the same thing as the other two, only not as well. The music is good, but the lyrics are weak. It's very "just okay". Still, I feel that this album would have been quite acceptable in the 70s (haha that's a joke about his song but it's the wrong decade get it)
