**camerinian** (8): Holy fuck this song is so catchy, what a hook, what a job by Kehlani, what a bouncy groove. The 90s RnB style percussion and baseline is so fucking slick and Kehlani just glides over it like that's all she's ever done. I even dig Lil Yachty's weird bars as a counterpoint to the cleanness of everything, even if his flow doesn't work as well. It's a tune, massively so, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

**Steelstepladder** (8): Lil Yachty surprisingly comes with a good verse here! And that chorus is just chefs kiss. I glanced over this one when I first heard the album but I find myself coming back to it more than I would expect.

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I'm leaving a mark on this one because it might be my 11. I'll update if it was or not. (It was not, but it was close.)

**purplechilipepper** (10): kehlani has such a sexy voice kill me queen

**lapascalia** (9.5): He managed to make me like a Yachty song wow… that line about pepperoni kills me every time. Kehlani was amazing as usual

**wardrum5** (9.3): when the beat picks up it is infectious! I didn't like it at first but this song has grown on me even though Lil Yachty's verse is goofy (it's not bad except for the final pizza bar)

**pisces\_king** (9.2): I really like Kehlani on this, it's the downtempo track that I needed on this record.

**rickikardashian** (9): ive gone from hating to loving the pepperoni line

**sarcasticsobs** (9): imagine how this could’ve been a 10 without the fucking pizza line

**Chevsapher** (8.6): The chorus is lovely, and the rhythm switch-ups are enjoyable. What in the world was that Lil Yachty feature, though? What is this, Pop 2?

**grinchelda** (8.2): i don't hate yachty's verse as much as i did immediately but putting pepperonis on your face is nasty behavior that will not be tolerated

**ignitethephoenix** (8): don’t love lil yatchy’s part as much but everything else is really good

**SideBTrack8** (8): Lil Yachty really just had to ruin what could have been a 10, huh?

**skargardin** (8): bop

**vintagebathingsuit** (8): wow, i LOVE this beat. kehlani's vocals are on point. the album was starting to blur together at this point so it's nice calvin switched it up a bit for this track.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's catchy I guess

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**bbfan132** (7): kehlani sounded great here! not super exciting but a pleasant track

**ImADudeDuh** (7): we hate lil yachty

**MrSwearword** (7): the pepperonis section made me drop the score. It's not delivery, Digiorno's or acceptable.

**vayyiqra** (7): Remember when Lil Yachty did a collab with Carly Rae Jepsen and made a song for Target department stores I think about that often

**bespectacIed** (5): kehlani sounds good as usual but this doesn't fit the sound of the album

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): he had all these other great songs and he gave Kehlani... this?

**anothertown** (4): “Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza” (Yachty & Harris 2017)

**pat-rickstar** (4): The pizza line is random and this is my least favourite on this album tbh but it's not awful

**CritneySpearz** (3.5): The pepperoni line just is so weird and out of place, kinda ruins the song for me. Kehlani sounds great though

**Steelstepladder** (7): Bouncy, fun, solid all around! My only real complaint is for a song about driving on the freeway it doesn't make for a very good driving song actually.

**camerinian** (6): Ok, I love the piano bounce with the claps as an intro and a foundation, I just wish that it wasn't Khalid and Future over the top of it. Never been a fan of either and I don't think either one is really suiting the vocal style to it too well, Future especially, even if his bars are actually pretty strong for him. Khalid's hook is alright, but his outro just sucks the energy of the track prematurely. Idk, I wish it came together better

---

**grinchelda** (10): definitely and obviously misheard some lyrics to this the first time i heard it but it's still s tier even if i think about it every time

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a driving a nighttime song. Also who would have thought Khalid and future would work together pretty well?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): THIS IS THE PERFECT DRIVING SONG! I wish there was less Future on this song, but goddamn Khalid served on here.

**Chevsapher** (9): The squiggly vaporwave motif and the high "string" synth on every beat are both clever. However, the real star of this track is the chorus.

**lapascalia** (9): For some reason the thought of Khalid and Future on the same song is weird to me but this is actually pretty great

**skargardin** (9): possibly the best thing khalid's been on

**pisces\_king** (8.9): Khalid has a great voice and I think he's wound up falling flat/bland on a lot of his music; this song feels unique, though.

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): this was the follow up single to slide right? it's a fine song on it's own but doesn't come close to its predecessor so i don't visit it often

**MrSwearword** (8): great beat but needed better artists than who ended up on it. Also, the "it's a vibe" or "on a vibe" shit is corny and tacky as fuck.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): remember when Khalid was consistently releasing only good music?

**pat-rickstar** (8): This is nice - it's groovy but still suits Khalid's style of slower R&B

**rickikardashian** (7.6): the chorus and beat are a lot better than future’s verses tbh

**bbfan132** (7.5): i like the production a lot here and future/khalid sound good

**sarcasticsobs** (7): possibly the only time i've really dug khalid?

**vayyiqra** (7): This is it, this is the vibe

**SmileAndTears** (6): Usually I like fart-sounding synths but this one is just annoying

**1998tweety** (5.5): I'm bored this is too long

**wavingwolves** (5): well future is not good in this but i love with the ooh-oooh-ooooh's

**anothertown** (4): boring

**brenda\_official** (4): future’s rapping just doesn’t fit the song at all? Its like they took the rapping from a different song and tried to fit it with this instrumental

**CrimsonROSET** (4): I'm not against Future. I really am not. But I am against any song in which Khalid is my favorite part.

**vintagebathingsuit** (4): yeah.....i don't really like future or khalid so this track was snooze for me.

**bulforster** (2): None of this comes together, Khalid delivery is so boring and I don't know that I'll ever like Future.

**camerinian** (10): THE BANGER TO END ALL BANGERS. DRAM is an absolute God damn treasure and he must be protected. I get the dorkiest smile on my face every time this song comes on, to the point where Yachty's shit lines don't even remotely affect it. This is pure fun through and through, we love it

**Steelstepladder** (10): This was my most listened to song in 2016 and I will adore it until the day I am in the ground

---

**MrSwearword** (10): DRAM is awful but he had fun on this song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the -2 are entirely for lil yachty

**camerinian** (7.5): I mean, of course this uses lyrics and motifs from the first track in a more downbeat context. How else does a sad pop album wrap up in the 2010s? Fuck me if it doesn't work every single time though. The fragility of this track from every angle is beautiful.

**Steelstepladder** (7): I do have a soft spot for the last song on an album being either the most lowkey or the most bombastic. Really like the echo effects on the voice too. Solid ending.

---

**SmileAndTears** (11): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, ktotally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it

**1998tweety** (10): this sounds like a BANKS song and i effing love it

**bespectacIed** (10): park so-dam gorgeous. What a great way to end Late Night Feelings (album), by interpolating Late Night Feelings (song). This is lowkey better

**hunnybee12** (10): pretty

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This reminds me in the best ways of that really emotional lowkey synth-pop (think Liability(Reprise)). This is going to get totally destroyed but it doesn't deserve it, #PopheadsNotHatingASongBelow120BPMChallenge

**Chevsapher** (9): Everyone take note—THIS is how you end an album.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): That voice modulation sends chills up my spine, honestly.

**teenage\_meme** (9): VOCODER

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): fantastic closer

**bulforster** (8): That "on and on and on..." refrain is very good so it's nice to end the album with it.

**jexan13** (8): In one hand this is quite nice and the interpolation of LNF is amazing. On the other hand, it lacks strength.

**MrSwearword** (8): I'll be nice and say I can see why this is the closer.

**purplechilipepper** (8): a really pretty closer

**vayyiqra** (8): What a cute, atmospheric ending to such a good album :uwu: I don't know who Ilsey is and she sounds quite a lot like Lykke I think WAIT she cowrote all of Lykke's last album which is amazing this explains so much.

**bbfan132** (7.5): it says ilsey but this is lykke li, right? i like how she is reusing lyrics from her first song in the outro, it’s a chill outro

**pisces\_king** (7.1): This makes me want to spiral, which I guess is powerful?

**anothertown** (6): it's ok i'm not feeling anything

**Hielord** (6): It feels like Mark ran out of ideas when he got to write this song

**pat-rickstar** (4): I wanted a banger to end the album - this is just boring

**waluigiest** (4): Charli xcx could do Spinning but mark ronson could never do Vroom Vroom

**wavingwolves** (4): a little too muted and i think 2am would make a better closing track

**camerinian** (8): I'll be honest I don't know what Party Next Door even does on this track, this is a Q/Calvin/DRAM collab far as I'm concerned and God that's a potent combo. The assertiveness of Q is the most reminiscent his album gets of classic g-funk (including the Snoop Dogg track), but then contrasting it with DRAM's effortless smoothness is such a great juxtaposition, it makes the vibe so unbelievably infectious, and the fatness of the bass kick on this helps wonders.

**Steelstepladder** (8): DRAM has such a slippery smooth delivery I am always shocked he isn't bigger than his moderate success. Just a groovy summer bop that's a joy to listen to all around.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): just vibing

**lapascalia** (9.5): So groovy, love Q’s flow

**wardrum5** (9.5): would be my eleven but it goes on just a bit long with Dram's verse and outro. But ScHoolboy Q's part is the highlight of the album

**bespectacIed** (9): fun

**TragicKingdom1** (9): how did they make Faking It a single but not this...........

**Hielord** (8.6): This song was unexpectedly amazing. Like I'm at the beach and I'm in heaven at the same time.

**Chevsapher** (8.4): This so fun and bouncey! The chorus is underwhelming, but the piano makes up for it.

**bulforster** (8): DRAM's feature at the end is the weakest part which doesn't leave me with a great impression of the song but the rest is still a good time.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Have you done the Disco rate yet?

**grinchelda** (8): proof that i really don't like food mentioned in songs, even when the food is weed. end of the first verse is iconic

**hunnybee12** (8): what happened to dram anyways

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): D.R.A.M. voice seventieeeeees... hella treeeeeees.....

**rickikardashian** (8): i don't know about cars but this is fun

**1998tweety** (7): She's alright

**bbfan132** (7): the first half was unmemorable but i liked the second half, whoever was singing sounded nice

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Why did we get rid of Dram? He was fun.

**MrSwearword** (7): it's decent...above decent actually, but I can't imagine I'll care about this after the rate.

**SmileAndTears** (7): It's fine. I like the chorus more than the verses

**pisces\_king** (6.8): Can obviously bop my head to this, but the chorus is similar to others on this track and in a less distinguished way.

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh we already rated 24K Magic why is someone rapping over it now

**PointlessBibliophage** (4): it's a song, that much is true

**camerinian** (9): Pharrell is incapable of not making bangers all the time. There is so much more going on here than there realistically should be for your average production of his, but I love that he just throws everything into this production. It's a wild time and I love that over the top messy funk of it.

**camerinian** (10): Holy shit. Wow. This was so close to taking my 11. This is everything Daft Punk are great at, everything they wanted to do on this album, and everything they can build off into the future all in one go. The swirling soundscapes resolving into the beautifully passionate vocals from Paul Williams, into the absolutely magical full band breakdown with that gorgeous horn line that just fills me with life, only to snatch it away and twist into the contemplative, haunting choral vocals as the swirling soundscapes work back in only to drop back out and leave us with a few acapella and sparse bars to let the whole thing soak in. It's a masterpiece, a well-deserved fan favourite, and a brilliant insight into the genius of the duo

**Steelstepladder** (8): The final climax of the song is so good. When the strings and choir hit in the last minute it's one of the best moments on the album. It's long and doesn't really have a place outside of the album but it's still pretty great and I genuinely think it deserved day 3.

**Chevsapher** (11): This is peak recorded music.

**Hielord** (11): This is an acoustic movie. Beautiful, made me cry.

**anothertown** (10): what?? This is incredible and I’m also happy to learn about the career of Paul Williams who incidentally wrote the music to the Muppet Christmas Carol

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Do YOU remember touch? Remember social interaction? Remember life?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait, this is actually a major bop and super interesting

**jexan13** (10): A strong for my 11. Holy god this song is not for my ears, is for my damn SOUL. I swear that if this isn't top 10 because "it's too long" and "it doesn't have woman vocals" I will commit a h*te crime.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): a quarantine mood

**turtle-thief** (10): A space odyssey of it's own.

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): i slept on this the last time i listened to the album. amazing. flawless. incredible. so close to giving this my 11.

**wavingwolves** (10): this hits different during a pandemic where you have to be socially isolated from people. v magical

**bbfan132** (9): i enjoyed how many different parts there were to this song, i never knew where it was going and that made it better

**bulforster** (9): I love the part with the horns and just wish it was a bit longer.

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): I cried to this at the end of summer 2013 (which was really the end of October) cause it had been the best summer of my 14 year old life to that point and I didn’t want the Red Sox season to end even though they had just literally won the World Series

**pisces\_king** (8.2): Again I'm a Gen Z/millennial cusp I like the songs short and sweet and snappy. But this is obviously pretty great and with the piano there is a departure from the preceding tracks and vibe.

**lapascalia** (8): I don’t really know how I feel about this song, it’s interesting. I think I can objectively recognize it’s good though.

**pat-rickstar** (8): Why is this intro lowkey scary? This track has some fantastic sections but some parts aren't so great. Also we love another 8+ minute song :)

**rickikardashian** (8): shoutout to whoever the sax player and pianist are for bringing life to this bitch

**vayyiqra** (8): Hold on ... if love is the answer you're home ... :pensive: the truth is that it is the answer ...

**grinchelda** (7.7): creepy. sounds like it belongs in a musical. a creepy musical.

**TiltControls** (7.2): I like the back half of the song but honestly the start scares me a little

**teenage\_meme** (7): way too much going on here for me. this song needs to chill out

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): it's certainly a memorable song, but personally it just felt too compartmental, nothing really come together as a single song, it all felt like a compilation of musical ideas

**1998tweety** (6): sorry but no

**ignitethephoenix** (6): why is this 4 different songs

**lostonthewayh0me** (6): too long lol.

**SmileAndTears** (6): Why did I think he was saying "daddy" the whole time

**bespectacIed** (5): 3:21-4:12 was excellent, the only redeeming part of this long ass sci-fi soundtrack

**MrSwearword** (5): the track production is really really cute but whoever the fuck is singing this can't carry a tune in a bucket, iCannot

**waluigiest** (5): okay Sondheim

**CritneySpearz** (4): ok this song makes me really uncomfortable, idk why but maybe it’s his weird voice? He kinda sounds like he would play Santa in a movie and I don’t know why I don’t like it because I have daddy issues and sleep with older men all the time so idk what this feeling I have is hope nobody reads this wow

**camerinian** (4.5): This just really does nothing for me. The hook on this is so very weak, the rest of the song is just in one ear and out the other. Diana's lyrics are nothing special and her delivery doesn't really complement or transform them. The production also does very little for me, decent bass groove aside. Meh.

**Steelstepladder** (4): I had to keep coming back to this song because I kept forgetting how this one went. I guess it's not the worst thing in the world but I don't see myself coming back to this anytime soon. Kinda weak after True Blue slayed as hard as it did.

---

**grinchelda** (10): k the back half of this album is officially loaded

**MrSwearword** (10): the best track on this album. The singing is lovely, the production works so well and this would be the track I would declare emblematic of this album's high points.

**SmileAndTears** (10): Love the vocals on this one and the production is incredible

**pisces\_king** (9.4): Beautiful, delicate, moody. The three genders.

**bespectacIed** (9): I wish ~wynter~ diana gordon the best

**ignitethephoenix** (9): wow this is so nice

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this was a bop

**Chevsapher** (8.4): The chorus is lacking, but everything else is killer. The chimes behind the second verse are just fabulous.

**1998tweety** (8): pretty

**bbfan132** (8): this is a total 180 from a song like dirty talk but this is great in it’s own way - her voice sounds wonderful here

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Yeah, I see it.

**purplechilipepper** (8): Diana Gordon slays me here and the production is on point

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a good retro song with a very strong chorus. I think it will be underrated.

**wavingwolves** (8): smooth bop

**jexan13** (7.5): this song makes me so sad, perhaps from the nostalgia

**anothertown** (7): Never forget when Diana Gordon revealed that “Becky with the good hair” was never a real person

**pat-rickstar** (6): A bit forgettable - I enjoy it while it's playing but forget anything about it once it's over

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): I didn't dislike this song, I just wish had a bit more going on, feels a bit too basic

**waluigiest** (5): this song had one good moment
