&#x200B;

\---

\*\*camerinian\*\* (4): It's an interlude that starts acapella with singing that's either off-key, badly layered, or both. Of course this wasn't gonna do well. If the live band in some bar charging $15 for a glass of beer was playing this, I don't think I'd mind, but it's really a momentum killer on the album otherwise.

&#x200B;

\*\*Steelstepladder\*\* (2): I... don't know what to do with this? It's in a weird place on the album too for what basically is a one minute interlude. Just not sure what the point of this is.

\---

\*\*Chevsapher\*\* (9): It sounds like an old-school jazz radio song over a funky bass. This should have been a full track!

\*\*lapascalia\*\* (8.5): Super funky

\*\*pisces\\\_king\*\* (8): I love Yebba, I feel weird rating interludes but this is pretty good.

\*\*cloudbustingmp3\*\* (7.8): twice shaking

\*\*bbfan132\*\* (7): not really a full track or anything but it’s a cool neo-soul piece

\*\*SmileAndTears\*\* (7): I like it? One of the weakest tracks here but it's still listenable

\*\*vayyiqra\*\* (7): This is a bop but why is it so short I think the songs with Yebba are meant to form a suite kind of? Like one long multi-part song within the album

\*\*grinchelda\*\* (6.5): must've been ding dong ditch bc this song is like thirty seconds

\*\*MrSwearword\*\* (6): interludes are normally cute when done right but this is just...not delivered right.

\*\*wavingwolves\*\* (6): cute but i wish it was longer

\*\*1998tweety\*\* (5.5): meh, twice outsold

\*\*anothertown\*\* (5): we get it Abigail you sing

\*\*jexan13\*\* (5): oh sh\*t run it's the jehovah witnesses

\*\*skargardin\*\* (5): Kinda necessary \[2\]

\*\*CrimsonROSET\*\* (4): She sounds in pain, is she alright?

\*\*purplechilipepper\*\* (4): and I'm bored again

\*\*brenda\\\_official\*\* (3): there is too much yebba on this album. Who even is yebba

\*\*ImADudeDuh\*\* (3): nah

\*\*RandomHypnotica\*\* (3): don't know what they were going for with this, but I didn't like it

\*\*pat-rickstar\*\* (0): Not sure if this should be considered an interlude since it's so short but I just don’t like her vocals here - it's not terrible but it's my least favourite in the rate

\*\*waluigiest\*\* (0): flop flop flop. impressive how they fit so much badness into 90 seconds

(0 x3) CrimsonROSET, ImADudeDuh, Steelstepladder

\---

\*\*camerinian\*\* (6): This is clearly the superior interlude track because it actually has a structure, a swell, and a much more competent vocal performance, even if that vocal does get a bit… Tones and I-ish.

\*\*Steelstepladder\*\* (0): This is such a weird stretch in the album and unlike the weird detours in RAM I can't really find a reason why it's structured like this. Like why is there two minute long interludes surrounding a song that is at the end of the day, just ok. If it was around True Blue or even Nothing Breaks Like a Heart I think it would make more sense but it's just kind of puzzling to me.

\---

\*\*pisces\\\_king\*\* (9.9): Now THIIIIIS is an interlude. To me it sounds like the feeling you get when you're having a great night with a really hot person and you feel the sexual tension rising and they're getting closer to you and you know the kiss is going to happen soon... ok bye

\*\*Chevsapher\*\* (9): Someone give this girl a Grammy.

\*\*lapascalia\*\* (7.5): Good but sounds slightly unfinished to me

\*\*bbfan132\*\* (7): i think i like the mini-songs by yebba more than the main song lol, good vocal performance here

\*\*jexan13\*\* (7): The vocal delivery is truly hard to get used to

\*\*oliveoilgarlic\*\* (7): when Yebba really leans into the nasty corners of her voice she sounds a little like Amy and I think that’s why she got three songs on this album (but he only let her show it off on this one)

\*\*vayyiqra\*\* (7): This is a vibe but it's a little too short

\*\*1998tweety\*\* (6.5): ok

\*\*SmileAndTears\*\* (6.5): My least favorite track

\*\*anothertown\*\* (6): we get it Abigail you sing

\*\*ignitethephoenix\*\* (5.5): I cannot stand what she is doing with her voice in this song.

\*\*purplechilipepper\*\* (5): more of the same I guess

\*\*wavingwolves\*\* (5): less enjoyable than anything else on the record i think

\*\*vintagebathingsuit\*\* (4): hm. no. not feeling this one.

\*\*pat-rickstar\*\* (3): Again, I just don't like her vocals here, something about them just annoy me?

\*\*bespectacIed\*\* (1): three too many yebba collabs in this album

\*\*MrSwearword\*\* (1): NOPE. The delivery was just awful

\*\*CrimsonROSET\*\* (0): Is she going to be alright? I don't think she's gonna be alright. She doesn't sound alright right now.

\*\*ImADudeDuh\*\* (0): oh i hated this why is she doing this with her voice

\*\*camerinian\*\* (5): Yeah. Uh, look it's not bad. I think there's definitely good elements here. The string accents are nice, the sludgy slowdown is an interesting decision. Um… it's a nice cool down before the great final stretch of the album? I just don't really think this low energy noodly track that doesn't really showcase any of the duo's strengths was what this phase of the album needed, tbh

&#x200B;

\*\*Steelstepladder\*\* (5): So I guess this is where the strings from the beginning of Beyond went but the build is just a bit to slow for me to really get invested the way I want to and I do tend to check out during this stretch of the album more than I'd like to admit

\---

\*\*Chevsapher\*\* (9.5): They're basically just showing off at this point.

\*\*bulforster\*\* (9): I'm already mad this was definitely robbed just for being an instrumental track

\*\*CrimsonROSET\*\* (9): I honestly don't have words?

\*\*sarcasticsobs\*\* (9): the ending is chef’s kiss

\*\*jexan13\*\* (8.5): Makes me kinda sad

\*\*bbfan132\*\* (8): i have nothing interesting to say because it was just an instrumental but i enjoyed this

\*\*vayyiqra\*\* (8): This song is weird and kind of spooky in an odd way and I like it

\*\*waluigiest\*\* (8): this sounds like Sufjan Stevens tbh

\*\*wavingwolves\*\* (8): is this going to be on the bottom 5? probably and it will be a show of tastelessness

\*\*anothertown\*\* (7): not really a “soundscape” person but ok

\*\*Hielord\*\* (7): It's like a watered-down version of Giorgio. I still like the abstract concept of it, yes, I want to sound smart.

\*\*ignitethephoenix\*\* (7): is this sim city music

\*\*oliveoilgarlic\*\* (7): how TIGHT their studio musicians were chefs kiss

\*\*purplechilipepper\*\* (7): for some reason this always makes me think of larger than life by the Backstreet boys in a good way

\*\*SmileAndTears\*\* (7): The production is impressive but it's not something I'd like to listen to often

\*\*pisces\\\_king\*\* (6.7): Definitely more experimental, I don't love it though.

\*\*pat-rickstar\*\* (6.5): A song of two halves - the first few minutes don’t do anything for me but from about 3 minutes in when it starts sounding darker it's awesome

\*\*1998tweety\*\* (6): meh

\*\*lapascalia\*\* (6): Not crazy about this

\*\*rickikardashian\*\* (6): who started peeing in the middle of this track

\*\*MrSwearword\*\* (5): is this motherboard located in the fucking Shire?

\*\*CritneySpearz\*\* (3.5): ew no thank you to the weird water gushy sounds near the end

\*\*ImADudeDuh\*\* (3): I’m sorry but this album is lowkey boring \[2\]

\*\*bespectacIed\*\* (1): we get it, they're robots

\*\*RandomHypnotica\*\* (0): this is extremely weird, lingering and jarring. It sounds like a weird cross between Sufjan Stevens, elements of PC Music and a generic 80's light disco song.

\*\*camerinian\*\* (6): See, here's where all the complaints Daft Punk unfairly gets about repetition kind of come home to roost, when there's not as much going on. I for one don't mind the loungey vibe they were going for, but it really doesn't evolve and/or bop as much as their best tend to, and it does run long for only the second track. It's not really representative of the rest of the album, so having it out this early is not surprising.

\*\*Steelstepladder\*\* (5): Well you take a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, and you get a song that is actually kind of disappointing after the fantastic opening. Not saying it's terrible but I would have liked to see the strong momentum continue instead of going for a lowkey number on song two.

\---

\*\*teenage\\\_meme\*\* (10): reminds me of one of my all-time favourite songs, "something about us." i love daft punk ballads!

\*\*lapascalia\*\* (9): Sad but beautiful – also the French accent is real strong in this one

\*\*MrSwearword\*\* (9): Digital Love has a disco tinged cousin, werk

\*\*Chevsapher\*\* (8.9): You can FEEL the longing.

\*\*pisces\\\_king\*\* (8.8): I am never going to be super into downtempo stuff but this is so well done and intricate so..

\*\*grinchelda\*\* (8.7): this gets me weirdly in my feels

\*\*bbfan132\*\* (8.5): smooth soul <3 <3 the robotic vocals oddly fit in well with the wonderful production

\*\*vintagebathingsuit\*\* (8.5): this song puts me in such a relaxed mood. i'm a sucker for little high-pitched guitars so this entire album is just made for me. it makes me feel like i'm floating in a lake somewhere at twilight or smth.

\*\*vayyiqra\*\* (8): :robot: :pensive: I hate that this will be underrated because it's a ballad.

\*\*wavingwolves\*\* (8): this one is pure late night regrets & overthinking

\*\*1998tweety\*\* (7): i sleep

\*\*ImADudeDuh\*\* (7): Love speedrun-: any%

\*\*Hielord\*\* (6.7): Weakest song of RAM imo, too slow and not as interesting as the other masterpieces of the album

\*\*ignitethephoenix\*\* (6.5): getting smooth elevator jazz vibes. Wish it was a bit shorter though

\*\*jexan13\*\* (6.5): My least favorite track of the album. Kinda irritating

\*\*PointlessBibliophage\*\* (6): i can't explain why but i dislike the voice in this one

\*\*SmileAndTears\*\* (6): It's good background music I guess?

\*\*waluigiest\*\* (6): this song is a year long

\*\*CrimsonROSET\*\* (5): haha why is this song 5 minues long

\*\*camerinian\*\* (9): Jesus it's sad what the baggage of one artist who is barely on the song outside of the intro and outro can do to a song's reputation. Yeah, I know Khaled is someone people love to hate, but Jesus the g-funk direction of the beat is really well delivered and Travis Scott delivers incredibly strongly in the auto-croon mould. If this was on the album proper, I guarantee it would be in a better position, but unfortunately \*someone\* decided they don't need to reciprocate oral on their wife, so this is his punishment.

\*\*Steelstepladder\*\* (1): Probably the worst Calvin Harris song here in my opinion. This is kind of like a diet version of the other songs I already rated sadly. Maybe this would sound better to me if I didn't just listen to songs like Slide and Heatstroke but it's kind of just forgettable.

\---

\*\*cremeebrulee\*\* (9): compared to prayers up, this is the better travis track

\*\*hikkaru\*\* (9): wait this is actually such a bop why isn't on calvin's album

\*\*lostonthewayh0me\*\* (9): another catchy tune. i wish khaled would stop yelling on his tracks tho.

\*\*SmileAndTears\*\* (9): God DJ Khaled annoys the hell out of me but this bops

\*\*1998tweety\*\* (8.5): Bop

\*\*bespectacIed\*\* (8): this had no business being a bop lol. Rating dj khaled high, a nightmare. but this was truly fun

\*\*lapascalia\*\* (8): It’s pretty good but I can see why it ended up on Khaled’s album, it would have probably been the weakest track of FWB imo

\*\*rickikardashian\*\* (8): giving  dj khaled a good score, i could not believe it

\*\*wardrum5\*\* (8): Never heard this before... why did DJ Khaled end up with the better Travis/Calvin summer song???? Also imagine if Calvin Harris just yelled "IT'S CALVIN!!!" all over every track

\*\*wavingwolves\*\* (8): ok points were made even if this is a dj khaled track

\*\*RandomHypnotica\*\* (7.9): I hate DJ Khaled so it upsets me that I like this song

\*\*pisces\\\_king\*\* (7.8): This is not a song I really paid attention to on Khaled's album, to be quite honest. It sounds like one of the filler tracks on Funk Wav Bounces. But I do love Jeremih and I enjoy Travis Scott's auto-tuned yeAA!s.

\*\*ignitethephoenix\*\* (7.5): kind of bops but I don’t love it

\*\*oliveoilgarlic\*\* (7.5): the funk wav bounces sound owns my ass ok don’t judge me

\*\*pat-rickstar\*\* (7.5): I dislike DJ Khaled but this is the superior Travis song in this rate

\*\*Chevsapher\*\* (7): This isn't bad, just painfully generic.

\*\*ImADudeDuh\*\* (7): not bad for a DJ Khaled song

\*\*waluigiest\*\* (7): WE THE BEST MUSIC

\*\*grinchelda\*\* (6): we da okayest music

\*\*vayyiqra\*\* (6): DJ KHALED

\*\*bbfan132\*\* (5.5): i thought that this was going to be awful and dj khaled’s presence was enough to make it Not Good™ but travis and jeremih sounded fine here

\*\*vintagebathingsuit\*\* (5.5): jesus christ khaled is obnoxious

\*\*CrimsonROSET\*\* (5): You're correct in assume I didn't expect this one coming, but that's because I expected this to end well? (In hindsight, this is a good song whenever I'm not reminded DJ Khaled has a hand in this.) Album: Random Access Memories

\*\*bulforster\*\* (4): Mess

\*\*anothertown\*\* (3): i can’t believe that metallic noise plays through the ENTIRE track… insanely annoying

\*\*skargardin\*\* (3): no....

\*\*MrSwearword\*\* (1): oops, I quit. Bye at the clattering noise in the back which just made this unpleasant.

\*\*TiltControls\*\* (0): DJ khalid really needs to find a new callout phrase cause he is not the best music

**wavingwolves** (3): i hate this song and i didn't even know it was by calvin but at the same time i feel some sort of nostalgia towards it so i can't just give it a 1... two points for mild nostalgia then!

**sarcasticsobs** (1): it's like all the worst parts of the music of EDC culture and adding in that "funk" in the 2nd verse to try and make up for it made everything worse. offensive.

**camerinian** (8.5): This is possibly the least funky track in a rate that actually has a fair number of decidedly not funky tracks, but fuck me the emo robot piano ballad is beautiful and I just want them to find their soul is that too much to ask

**Steelstepladder** (8): It's kind of shocking how well Daft Punk were able to emote through all that autotune but they were able to do it. Just a surprisingly great piano ballad that's placed extremely well after Giogio.

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I expected this to break off into Video Killed the Radiostar at so many points.

**teenage\_meme** (10): robot ballad!!!!!!

**Chevsapher** (9.3): That piano is so gorgeous. The detailed instrumentation on this album really takes it to the next level.

**Hielord** (8): I love the piano

**MrSwearword** (8): I almost derided this because it's so downturn but I granted it mercy because it slays in its own right. Putting this right after Giorgio by Moroder is forever CHOICES made on this album.

**pisces\_king** (8): Emo vibes.

**vayyiqra** (8): I always thought this was cheesy and not that good but I was balladophobic and I was wrong :pensive:

**vintagebathingsuit** (8): this is such an underrated track from this album. robots cry too, guys.

**wavingwolves** (8): cool

**rickikardashian** (7.8): if daft punk made a song for the twilight soundtrack

**grinchelda** (7.5): perhaps too relatable

**jexan13** (7.5): Would have been a bit higher without the boring vocals

**lapascalia** (7.5): It’s a pretty song

**anothertown** (7): there has to be at least one very corny song in a 70s/80s project, it gives it character.

**hunnybee12** (7): this kinda drags

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): sad robot hours

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): It's fine

**bbfan132** (6): a decent track but it doesn’t really go anywhere and the soulful production + robotic vocal combo doesn’t work as well here

**1998tweety** (5): im sleeping and not in a good way

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): this is just such a non-song... idk how else to put it

**bulforster** (4): The robot with feelings thing is played out at this point.

**camerinian** (8.5): Really shocked people didn't vibe with this, because Snoop Dogg is just perfect always, indisputably. That's not up for debate. Y'all can have Takeoff and Johnny boy, whatever, but this is a Snoop slander free zone, and I just want the fucking sun to be out in my southern hemisphere hellhole so I can lie on my balcony while he speaks those sweet entreaties.

**Steelstepladder** (7): It's good! Kind of like a longer version of Snoop Dogs California Gurls verse which doesn't sound like a compliment but it is. Although when it comes to Snoop summer songs, I don't think it approaches Young Wild and Free.

---

**turtle-thief** (10): John Legend and Snoop dog would treat me well.

**lapascalia** (9.5): Love this one

**grinchelda** (8.6): made me wanna call snoop daddy and idk how i feel about that

**oliveoilgarlic** (8.5): Snoop and this beat are a perfect match

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Maybe Snoop snapped

**Chevsapher** (8): This is a fun track, but it doesn't stand out from the tracks around it.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Snoop ate

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): calvins production is funky but I feel like there’s a spark this missing to make this excellent

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I can't properly replicate over text my utter shock when I heard this song and Snoop Dog came on.

**MrSwearword** (7): John sounds fine on the chorus, but Snoop sounded a bit weird on the song and the other one...too inconsequential.

**vayyiqra** (7): If we took a holiday / Took some time to celebrate / Just one day out of life / It would be, it would be so nice

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): this would be a great song to smoke to, late evening...chill, catchy. liked this one.

**pisces\_king** (6.7): The funky bass just barely keeps this song in line with the feel of the rest of the album.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): it’s not bad, it’s just unremarkable in the context of the album

**bulforster** (6): Laid back to the point of becoming a bit boring.

**wavingwolves** (6): restaurant music like everything john legend is involved in

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): i get that this is trying to go for a sultry kinda vibe but I just ain't feeling it

**bbfan132** (5.5): why does every song sound the same? and each track is getting weaker - john legend sounds good here and the synth in the background is ok but it’s bland

**ImADudeDuh** (5): forgettable tbh

**pat-rickstar** (5): Meh, too short and doesn’t really stick with you once it's over

**bespectacIed** (4): snoop dogg's voice truly the third most calming voice in the world after morgan freeman's and david attenborough's. but this is meh

**lostonthewayh0me** (4): there's a lot going on here, and it just doesn't come together

**anothertown** (3): the one thing I didn’t want on this album is John Legend

**Steelstepladder** (5): An alright closer but not a song I'd go to outside of the album. After bop after bop it's cool that we got a slower song to end things off but this album is at its best when the grooves are the tightest, and this is pretty loose and laid back. Not the worst but compared to what came earlier it's kind of forgettable.

**camerinian** (2): I’m really shocked that this song isn’t bottom five of the rate nor is it the lowest rated song from Funk Wav, cos I genuinely can’t stand this song. I get going for a more relaxed sunset-type tune to close out the album after nothing but groovy summer bops, but a) there is not nearly as much distinctive going on in this production than any other song on this album, and b) holy shit Jessie Reyez is just bad. Like, really bad. She kills any laid-back vibe this song could possibly have gone for because her voice is just that shrill. Everything y’all said about Camilla on Find U Again applies 10-fold for her. Also the lyrics are just some shite clingy “If you don’t love me at my worst etc. etc” whatever blah, terrible closer.

---

**anothertown** (10): Reina

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Why does this get so much hate, it slaps tbh

**MrSwearword** (10): "I'd rather be Hard to Love than easy to leave" is just great songwriting and the beat is fabulous for this.

**SideBTrack8** (10): STAN JESSIE REYEZ

**grinchelda** (9.6): hot people claiming they're ugly quelle surprise

**lapascalia** (9): I’m not the biggest Jessie fan but this is song is really beautiful

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): this song isn't

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The indie-acoustic songwriting paired with the understated yet funky production is a fascinating pairing.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8.5): I’m not the biggest fan of her voice but the chorus, the production and the vibes on this are a+++

**1998tweety** (8): Lowkey Jessie works extremely well on this type of production

**wardrum5** (8): Wish this was a bit faster and more upbeat to end the album

**pisces\_king** (7.2): The affect that Jessie Reyez throws in her voice can get on my nerves, but this song is pleasant enough.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): That 'oOoOoOo' pulled my fight or flight senses. Why is this how the album ends?

**ignitethephoenix** (6): my least favourite on the album for sure.

**wavingwolves** (6): cute

**bulforster** (5.5): I want to like this, I appreciate the lowkey moment and the sentiment of the song but she has a bad case of bananis and avocadis and some of the lyrics are real clunkers.

**bbfan132** (5): i like jessie’s voice but this song doesn’t do her justice at all, there’s nothing interesting about it at all

**skargardin** (5): underwhelming end to the album

**vayyiqra** (5): I can taste the avocadies as I listen to this

**bespectacIed** (4): same case with the song before it, it sounds ok but why is this here???

**lostonthewayh0me** (4): sorry, this song is just irritating

**SmileAndTears** (4): Not a fan of her delivery

**vintagebathingsuit** (3): i love the chill, smooth guitar. but holy shit, i can't stand jessie's voice. no thanks.

**camerinian** (7.5): I mean it's the less-good Travis Scott collab (or so I thought) but I still really dig how he pulls back and is fully upbeat for like the first time ever maybe??? Dude's happy, I can't fault that, even if the wonky-ass production seems to swap for me between fun or weird and unsuited based on what day it is and nothing else. That guitar lick sounds fucking sick tho

**Steelstepladder** (3): One of the weaker Calvin Harris tracks tbh. I like it but the slower beat and an OK Travis Scott performance doesn't really lend well to replays. Also Travis's autotune doesn't do well against the more organic production of the project so he tries to add the electronic breakdown at the end and it just doesn't work like it should

---

**anothertown** (10): if this played at the club it is what I would run to the floor after hearing 1 beat like the old prince harry meme. The little guitar chugs make me like bla bla I crazy now

**purplechilipepper** (10): I fucking love steak ugh

**grinchelda** (9.7): i'll pray to that

**lapascalia** (9): The production of this song is stellar but the autotune is a little much for me… I guess I’m just not a big Travis fan

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The melodies saved the chirus, because that lyricism is just cheesy. Otherwise, this is a killer track. That outro took me to church, y'all.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): can we please rate astroworld im begging

**vintagebathingsuit** (8): i really like this, travis sounds really good. the kind of breakdown at the end was awesome.

**wardrum5** (7.7): underwhelming

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): love the breakdown at the end and the "thank god i know what a blessing is" but the rest of the song is ehhh to me

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): love the outro

**pisces\_king** (7.2): Like Cash Out, it's almost like a side B version of another more prominent track on this record. I do like the chorus better, though.

**1998tweety** (7): Travis is usually meh but this is cute

**bulforster** (7): Those bright piano hits nicely counterbalance Travis' slightly woozy delivery keeping the song from dragging.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): weird syncopated beat go off

**sarcasticsobs** (7): this is where i started to get tired of the VERY similar underlying beat for the first like half of the record

**vayyiqra** (7): Molly Percocet (Percocet)

**wavingwolves** (7): hey this fucks a little

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): disappointing for a Travis track

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): There are parts I like, like the glitchy ending, but it's not a song I can see myself revisiting

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): The autotune is very distracting. Sick production tho

**bbfan132** (6): sounded like it was trying to sound like everything else on this album, not strong but not bad

**CrimsonROSET** (5): Let me tell you what ISN'T a blessing.

**camerinian** (7): THAT INTRO IS A FUCKING 11. But the rest of the song is not the intro unfortunately, and while the bubbly baseline and the warmth of the vocoder lyrics is really lovely, it just doesn't get back to the magical, awe-inspiring wonder of the intro, so it can't help but pale in comparison.

**Steelstepladder** (4): It's ok, but the strings at the begining set this song up for something it doesn't really pay off. I wish they brought them back at the end in an interesting way but it just kind of rides the same chill groove for the whole song.

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): That start >

**grinchelda** (9.5): movie intro credit music sounding bop

**Chevsapher** (9): I love the lyricism in this song, and the Moroder-esque synths toward the end are a great callback to the first portion of the album.

**teenage\_meme** (9): robot ballad!!!!!!!!!!

**MrSwearword** (8): after the movie intro beginning, this sort of falls flat

**vayyiqra** (8): Daft Punk fuck me up with those disco strings and philosophical lyrics

**vintagebathingsuit** (8): that string section gets me every time.

**wavingwolves** (8): this sounds like a videogame soundtrack and it rules

**jexan13** (7.5): The intro is giving me Pokemon vibes. Like, prepare for the battle with the champion vibes

**pisces\_king** (7.5): Solid, not a standout.

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is so close to be amazing but it doesnt get there

**bbfan132** (6.5): i enjoyed the instrumental enough for me to give it a semi-good score but it feels more like an extended interlude than a notable song

**MrSwearword** (10): secret Taylor shade...ok not secret but shade at Taylor is always welcome

**lapascalia** (8.5): This is such an earworm

**Hielord** (7.8): This song sounds much better now than in 2016, idk why. Maybe I have better headphones now

**J\_Toe** (7): wait, is that him singing? didn't think he ever sang

**PointlessBibliophage** (6): this isn't a bad song but it kinda has zero personality

**wavingwolves** (5): it's fine i guess

**sarcasticsobs** (3): if he really tried i bet he could make this more boring

**Steelstepladder** (7): Normally I'm not a fan of Nicki going extremely pop but the groove is undeniable. Maybe not the song I would go to when I want a dose of Nicki but a solid entry regardless.

**camerinian** (6.5): Wasn't wild about this when I first came to the album but ok maybe Nicki does really kill the singing a LOT more than I remember, and her energy is actually kind of infectious over the beat. Shame she still has to rap, but credit where it's earned

---

**turtle-thief** (11): This track is the one that has outlived the others in my library since 2017, idk why this one but it just feels like getting kissed by the sun. Nicki's autotune sounds just good enough for it not to be annoying, and she just rides it so well that i imagine she must've had as much fun singing it as i had girating my hips. It's a vibe.

**bespectacIed** (10): Expecting this to go out very early because aside from being made by Nicki, it's a BAD nicki song, so that's a popheads double whammy. She doesn't even sound like herself here??? But because I'm braindead for nicki, I'm gonna give this a 10 lmao. This is very refreshing, very island gyal trinidadian gyal. The rap verse so funny

**pisces\_king** (10): Obsessed with Nicki on this; her singing is sweet, which is not a tone we get from her very often. It's so nice! It's also so damn catchy.

**grinchelda** (9.5): beep beep nicki

**1998tweety** (9): Queen Nicki dominant

**lostonthewayh0me** (9): cute album track. nicki delivers with her rapping and singing

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): see nicki it didn't use to be so hard for you to collab with people who aren't pedos (pleeeeease let this comment age well)

**wardrum5** (8.8): has what Megatron wants

**lapascalia** (8.5): I wish the autotune wasn’t so heavy because I don’t think she needs it, the rap verse really saves the song for me though. I also can’t help but think this is the type of song Doja would be amazing on…

**bulforster** (8): Cute song

**cremeebrulee** (8): bringing the blunt .. emily blunt .. ok nicki

**ignitethephoenix** (8): not a fan of the autotune of Nicki’s voice but her verses are good.

**skargardin** (8): I will forever associate this song with a trip to a very specific grocery store where they happened to play it the summer this released, ugh... memories

**Chevsapher** (7.9): I love, love, love the bridge. The rest of the song feels like filler.

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): I have a very bad relationship with the word 'skrt'. Also, "I ain't with the drama that ain't what I need" is probably the worst lyric in this album fully because it's sang by Nicki Minaj, followed closely by "I need you to skrt on me". The verse is fine I guess?

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The Emily Blunt line is kind of iconic

**teenage\_meme** (7.5): not a big fan of nicki or trop-pop, but that outro was sick

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): tropical bubblegum pop Nicki >

**Hielord** (6.8): Nicki singing makes me feel nostalgic

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): SKRT. ON. ME.

**vintagebathingsuit** (6.5): ooh another really nice beat. i don't really know if nicki's voice suits the excessive autotune, though? i would've preferred if they got a different vocalist to sing the melodies and let nicki handle the rapping. the switch to the rap verse was a bit abrupt.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): The instrumental is cute, but idk what's with nicki's vocals but it sounds really off and I hate it.

**vayyiqra** (6): Nekci Menij

**bbfan132** (5.5): doja did a better job at making a song like this

**anothertown** (5): dollar store beat…. Emily Blunt.

**brenda\_official** (5): this does not sound like nicki at all

**hikkaru** (5): nicki's singing thing here isn't great imo

**MrSwearword** (4): absolutely fucking not to Nicki as a singer. NO. The production is enough to save it from utter nuking. As for the verse Nicki has here? NO.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): autotune really does not compliment nicki tbh

**wavingwolves** (3): this features one of nicki's worst verses

**TragicKingdom1** (0): no <3

**camerinian** (8): I like The Avalanches. This reminds me of The Avalanches. I like this a lot. That’s all

**Steelstepladder** (2): Okay this feels harsh but I mean... it's fine for what it is but it's just a prelude. It's a prelude to a pretty good song but it's still just a prelude.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): super pointless to separate the intro, but it did beautifully set up late night feelings

**jexan13** (10): Hopefuly in a rate with so many instrumental tracks this one doesn't get obliterated. Because this + LNF is greatness.

**MrSwearword** (10): a cute prelude, slay

**vayyiqra** (10): I love that this album has an overture it's so cinematic and lush and I love Lykke this is so GOOD fuck

**Chevsapher** (9): This feels so warm. I love those disco strings!

**lapascalia** (9): Beautiful intro

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): I LOVE the lushness of this, feels like I’m on my way to a big formal party in 70s New York

**vintagebathingsuit** (9): this is actually really beautiful.

**pisces\_king** (8.8): I love a dramatic prelude, and this sets up Late Night Feelings (and the entire album) whimsically.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): cool

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): chromatica ii WHO???

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): can you say atmospheric and thematic Intro done right

**rickikardashian** (8): i feel the obligation to give this a good score because i know it will get TANKED

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): solid intro

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): She's a cute intro

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I'm unsure I should count this separate from Late Night Feelings.

**CritneySpearz** (7): pretty good transition into LNF

**pat-rickstar** (7): Perfectly nice intro but doesn't really add much to the album taken as a standalone song

**sarcasticsobs** (7): pretty

**wavingwolves** (7): cute intro!! it gives ambiance so i stan

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): This is pretty much just a short little version of Late Night Feelings, and I don't have an issue with that

**1998tweety** (6): i mean whatchu want me to say

**Hielord** (6): Nice prelude, but it feels like it was made with the leftovers of Late Night Feelings

**bbfan132** (5): this doesn’t sound bad or anything but it’s a prelude so i’m just going to give it a neutral rating

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i hate interludes

**skargardin** (5): Kinda unnecessary

**purplechilipepper** (2): boring

**waluigiest** (2): ...sure
