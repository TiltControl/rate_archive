[21:02:37] flava: Kinda realised this is like dont tell em at home
[21:02:40] bogo: we're so close to drunk on a plane making it out of day 1
[21:02:51] bogo: apparently this samples fugees or something?
[21:03:04] impla: well yes
[21:03:15] bogo: i don't recognize the sample

[21:03:44] camerinian: i mean
[21:03:48] camerinian: it's one of their more famous songs
[21:04:05] bogo: 90s r&amp;b is one of my biggest blind spots
[21:04:24] flava: If drunk on a plane makes it out of day 1 i will give rona an internet hug

[21:04:58] pbklol: theres easily 25 songs worse than it
[21:05:06] bogo: wait this song isn't over???
[21:05:10] ImADudeDuh: it's already a victory that it managed to pass 5.000 average
[21:05:26] ImADudeDuh: anyways this song did deserve better
[21:05:29] flava: Yeah but it's a country song by a man. And i only know of one country song by a man to make it past day 1
[21:05:45] ImADudeDuh: like i won't remmeber how the verses go but it's still a cute bop
[21:06:08] flava: I think theres a good chance at least one country song by a man makes it to day 2 since we have 5 slots left and 3? Left
