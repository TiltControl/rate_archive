[19:43:55] wasian-invasion: stay strong partition
[19:44:00] BleepBloopMusicFan: I just think the chorus is kinda annoying
[19:44:11] babadork: jay-z is the problem
[19:44:19] BleepBloopMusicFan: I don't mind Jay Z on it
[19:44:21] Roxie: i was at a big 3 show so i had to 10 this as thanks
[19:44:25] TiltControls: We've only rated it in the album rate and it came 7th
[19:44:26] nonchalantthoughts: y'all just mad you didn't get to see this in RWT /hj
[19:44:34] ignitephoenix: i like jay z's part too but like i will blame the man lol
[19:44:47] flava: i blame scott storch and jayz for this
[19:45:01] TiltControls: It was 3rd highest on the album after Partition and XO it seems
[19:45:03] BleepBloopMusicFan: It might honestly be my least favorite song on her self titled or like bottom 3
[19:45:08] nonchalantthoughts: roxie why did we have the same comment
[19:45:09] flava: i dont even know if scott had anything to do with this but i gave give it to me my 11 so fuck scott storch
[19:45:14] Roxie: @nonchalantthoughts twins
[19:45:37] jman457: If I'm being honest a lot of self titled didn't age well in terms of production
