[20:10:32] Roxie: single down !!!!!

[20:10:37] BleepBloopMusicFan: I wasn't expecting this to be third out from the album
[20:10:38] TakeOnMeByA-ha: this is fine
[20:10:59] BleepBloopMusicFan: My guess was going to be Otherside
[20:11:10] Ghost-Quartet: My theory is that this song being the lead single for The Gift is the main reason everyone ignores it
[20:11:36] Ghost-Quartet: Because this 100% sounds like it's just for the credits of The Lion King (2019) so everyone just assumed that's what The Gift was and then they tuned out
[20:12:18] Catalyst: Hmmmmm
[20:12:34] Catalyst: sounds very realistic
[20:12:40] BleepBloopMusicFan: I like it a lot but yeah it wouldn't be the most exciting choice for a single to tune people in.
[20:12:49] BleepBloopMusicFan: It should have been Mood 4 Eva oprah
[20:13:09] TakeOnMeByA-ha: well the post isnt on the sub yet so maybe this is just an extended fakeout
[20:13:28] Ghost-Quartet: I think she Beyonce was just in a weird place image wise at this point in time
[20:13:47] BleepBloopMusicFan: Making a fakeout for a song that, in the grand scheme of the rate, people don't really GAF about would be kinda funny
[20:14:09] Ghost-Quartet: It's on Discord though
