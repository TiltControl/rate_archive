[21:39:36] Soalai: Working on a '90s soft rock rate, it's mainly Goo Goo Dolls vs. Hootie vs. MB20 vs. Third Eye Blind, but I'm adding a bunch of other songs if people wanna do a bonus rate or just more variety
[21:39:44] Catalyst: ooooo
[21:39:53] TakeOnMeByA-ha: you and steel should collab on that idea
[21:39:57] TakeOnMeByA-ha: she has a similar idea in the works
[21:40:06] Soalai: Like I have random Dave Matthews, Counting Crows, Semisonic just thrown in there
[21:40:07] NervousLemon: Id rather be listening to Smooth by Santana and Rob Thomas featuring Matchbox 20
