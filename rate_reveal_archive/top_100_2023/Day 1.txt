[20:09:36] Hypnotica: not the bose product placement
[20:09:48] Jennynuts: chappell has a distinctly different sound imo
[20:09:59] hikk: it's not that deep they're just both gay
[20:10:04] Roxie: we could only have one unfilltered lesbian in pop culture
[20:10:05] SteelStepladder: Idk what Renee's sound is
[20:10:07] Jennynuts: renee sounds like 'the sound of alt pop in current year'&nbsp;– the microgenre thats indebted to haim &amp; muna
[20:10:08] jacksboredtoday: renee rapp has all the talent in the world as a singer and performer she just needs someone to write good songs for her
[20:10:26] Rai: oh btw if people aren't aware reddit-stream.com is a great way to follow the reddit thread simultaneously without refreshing every ten

[20:11:24] ChopperRCRG: @jacksboredtoday You are so right. If she gets with Dan Nigro while he is as hot as he is in pop at the moment it could propeller her so far.
[20:11:51] halz: renee singlehandedly carrying the mean girls musical on her back
[20:11:55] Jennynuts: i can hear the theatre kid coming off her
[20:11:59] ricki: in an alternate reality ariana grande gets brochitis the same week as wicked auditions happens, renee gets the glinda role, and 2024 ult is sabrina vs chappell vs renee
[20:12:06] Roxie: and we CHEER
[20:12:24] halz: in the alternate reality where the holy trinity is renee sabrina and chappel with charli still flopping
[20:12:29] nonchalantthoughts: saw wicked yesterday and my girl ari killed it as glinda

[20:18:47] ChopperRCRG: I think the fact that her whole career revolved around a meme like personality didn’t serve her well when she didn’t have the artistry there. Lil Nas X has a similar entrance to fame, but was quickly releasing more serious music and I think he still has
[20:18:48] Roxie: was maybe your the problem this year
[20:18:50] jirachi: danc11ngs done

[21:57:36] MK_dex: &gt; I say this as a fan of Taylor Swift’s music: everyone always begs Taylor to release a rock album, but I have serious doubts about her ability to pull this off.

[21:58:26] handmadeh3aven: joey king
[21:58:30] WesternWind: Ty
[21:58:31] Jennynuts: "so high school" is the only song i really liked from her album this year

[21:58:40] vayyiqra: yea she can do pop-rock not . hard rock i guess
[21:58:42] WesternWind: Yasss

[21:59:30] ricki: her early work was still pretty poppy
[21:59:32] Roxie: i need to rave dj it
[21:59:33] Jennynuts: whether country is distinct from 'pop music' is another discussion
[21:59:39] ricki: like sorry she was always a pop princess she just wore cowboy boots
[21:59:40] Rai: girl at home is outsider music &lt;3
[21:59:42] Roxie: what is the plot of this video
[21:59:50] ricki: 1989 tv teaser

[00:19:30] wolves: oh yeah i like this song
[00:19:30] ChopperRCRG: This experience is so fun having not seen many of these videos yet.
[00:19:34] Hypnotica: im gonna be honest i still don't know what kiss and i hold the cutters means
[00:19:36] wolves: i think this is the one doja song from last yr i like
[00:19:43] Jules: Doja having a good year in 2023 while simultaneously completely tanking her career probably for the rest of her life was so gaggy in retrospect
[00:19:43] bigbigbee: Everyone should vote mamushi this year btw
[00:19:46] ricki: fun fact, she didnt have to use a crate,  she can just do that
[00:19:50] bigbigbee: Yhat isn’t related
[00:19:53] BleepBloopMusicFan: This really is a good opportunity to watch more music videos
[00:19:55] bigbigbee: I just started thinking about 2024
[00:20:05] ricki: she didnt have any more budget so she just went out with a camcorder, recorded some random houses, and levitated a little
[00:20:13] Rai: i think this is curious cos im the same, i'd got to know most of these songs but ive absolutely not had much awareness of a lot of their music vids

[00:20:25] wolves: its so scary
[00:20:26] Hypnotica: oh wait i just googled and the lyrics are kiss and i hope they caught us... i legitimately thought it was "kiss and I hold the cutters" this whole time like it was some avant gard fiona apple reference :skull:
[00:20:35] bigbigbee: so sad, I love music videoa
[00:20:37] garbagebenji: bye

[00:22:41] BleepBloopMusicFan: Oh wait no we're getting three
[00:22:42] ricki: im sure theres 3 chappell
[00:22:43] wolves: i voted a single chappell song and its her best and most underappreciated song
[00:22:44] TiltControls: wasnt femininomenon 2022
[00:22:48] BleepBloopMusicFan: I forgot about SGUMG :sob:
[00:22:52] goorry12: i mean if feather was in like top 90 i fear that chappell isnt on the top 100
[00:22:52] pbklol: well. rai didnt stop me
[00:22:54] Rai: here's how red velvet - chill kill can still win
[00:22:55] TakeOnMeByA-ha: i didnt think feminineomenom was ellgible [2]
[00:23:02] ricki: not enough people knew femininomenom in 2023
[00:23:06] jacksboredtoday: im sure there's 3 chappell but i assume she's not winning like she 100% is this year

[00:23:22] hikk: chappell was solidly a sub fave last november
[00:23:25] ricki: but the competition is tough
[00:23:25] TakeOnMeByA-ha: honestly i feel like its girl so confusing remix's to lose
[00:23:26] MK_dex: the idea chappell top 3 is casual/HTG!/SGUMG
[00:23:28] pbklol: oh wait i think it didnt make my final list im using the list i sent on discord before ppl informed me feminininomenon wasnt eligible
[00:23:30] Hypnotica: how about we answer the chappell course rn
[00:23:33] pbklol: casual isnt eligible
[00:23:34] BleepBloopMusicFan: Casual is not eligible
[00:23:38] jacksboredtoday: i feel like Charli has too much vote splitting risk
[00:23:40] Rai: for the most part people were very good about not submitting non-eligible chappell songs over her unhinged album cycle
[00:23:41] MK_dex: nvmind
[00:23:42] Hypnotica: casual was 2022 i believe ya
[00:23:43] ChopperRCRG: I didn’t pay attention to the rate rules but I am guessing an artist can only make the list 3 times?
[00:23:47] pbklol: yea
[00:23:48] Hypnotica: correct
[00:23:51] ricki: bc people didnt know chappell
[00:23:51] bigbigbee: The winner this year…will be PORTER ROBINSON CHEERLEADER!!!
[00:23:51] Rai: but yes a surprising number of chappell songs were simply uneligible
