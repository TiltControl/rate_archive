[23:00:05] Ghost-Quartet: "Some of them want to be abused" is kinda problematic if you think about it
[23:00:08] Roxie: if sir duke wins with no 11s the one time i didnt 11 it im gonna be so sad
[23:00:13] Roxie: thats why they lost [2]
[23:00:20] TakeOnMeByA-ha: sir duke has at least 5 11s
[23:00:38] stealthamo: would've preferred this, but it's not like i'm going to be mad that stevie won
[23:01:11] ImADudeDuh: my favorite thing about this song is that they tried to include this in Just Dance and made it a map that included lore and everything and then they didn't get the rights or something so they had to just dub over it with their own song
[23:01:21] kinghan: man i love this track
[23:01:24] beeozan: :sob:
[23:01:26] xavislay: hello?!
