[18:45:24] babadork: i like it, but once it starts dragging i start wishing i was listening to the song it was interpolating instead
[18:45:26] thesmokeylife: yeah I rated very few of the tracks in this rate below a 6 I think
[18:46:26] thesmokeylife: I think I walked away from this record wishing it had different production
[18:46:34] king: im kind of a meaner rater on average but i still had fairly high averages
[18:46:42] thesmokeylife: maybe Donald glover shouldn't produce his own records
[18:46:43] king: i think gambino my avg was below 6 but all the others were in the 7s
[18:47:08] apatel27: time to wake everyone up a bit
