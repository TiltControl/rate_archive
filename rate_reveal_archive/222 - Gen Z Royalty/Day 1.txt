[20:02:22] yvesdot: OK I will listen to try to understand everyone's minds. I am an empathetic person deep down
[20:02:22] ambitiousbulbasaur: popheads HATES ballads omg
[20:02:28] FitzMarble: true @ jules
[20:02:28] nonchalantthoughts: real haters would give this a 10
[20:02:30] bluepupz: balladphobia strikes again
[20:02:35] goorry12: im starting to think that all of that billie is doing really bad propaganda was misleading
[20:02:36] impla: you shouldve read the rate post title
[20:02:40] NervousLemon: Popheads hates ballads and yet Billie has not lost a song yet
[20:03:09] xavislay: because billie's ballads are good
[20:03:15] Jules: eh
[20:03:19] bluepupz: i didn't do whichever rate SOUR was in, i assume her ballads on that album were also mostly day 1 outs
[20:03:21] Poydoo: it's fine billie will lose all her songs in day 2
[20:03:22] NervousLemon: Some of them perhaps
[20:03:27] bran: i think people are forgetting billie had #2 aoty on popheads

[20:15:58] ChopperRCRG: Listening to Sigrid since before she won that BBC sound of the year award is my roman empire. I feel like I went to school with her
[20:16:02] wathombe: it was just before my new music renaissance
[20:16:06] TakeOnMeByA-ha: thinking about how we did a rate with sigrid maggie rogers and king princess and it was called the anticipated pop girls rate and since then none of those people have been relevant again
[20:16:06] camerinian: don't feel like crying was thee bop of 2019
[20:16:15] bran: this is kinda her only slay ngl
[20:16:15] camerinian: but yeah after that it's felt like radio silence

[20:16:25] Taco: outsold ethel cain
[20:16:27] Jules: kinda like alessia cara
[20:16:33] curryraejepsen: sigrid maggie rogers and king princess is the most aggressively 2018 cut of artists possible
[20:16:44] CarlieScion: sigrid still tours like crazy in norway so in my head she's still famous 💔

[20:55:46] ChopperRCRG: thank you cipcakke
[20:55:48] yvesdot: Oh my God I missed Purple Lace Bra?! It's over
[20:56:15] ChopperRCRG: i need to listen to the album again bc purple lace bra was good
[20:57:08] yvesdot: Honestly I think had the album been 5% shorter it would have been a smash for me. I love a few of the songs and like a lot of them, but it's weirdly long even if you're not my brand of insane completionist, I think.
[20:57:19] yvesdot: This is a revelation though thanks mods
[20:57:42] yvesdot: So far the only Cupcakke remix to really take up residence in my brain is the Misery one but in my defense that might have been our peak
[20:57:56] ChopperRCRG: it is too long which was why i avoided listening
[20:58:08] yvesdot: @ChopperRCRG Can I be kind of messy on this subject
[20:58:14] ChopperRCRG: please
[20:58:26] ChopperRCRG: like please do
[20:58:27] yvesdot: It is truly so crazy that after it leaked she cut two songs from the physical (so they weren't that good?) and then replaced them with three songs she wrote in like five minutes
[20:58:37] yvesdot: WHICH IS TALENT! I COULD NOT WRITE ANYTHING IN SUCH A SHORT TIME FRAME. BUT.
[20:58:47] yvesdot: I must question some of the artistic integrity of this record as a result you understand,
[20:59:06] yvesdot: I mean obviously had she written Poker Face in that time I wouldn't be saying anything. But it must needs be acknowledged she did not
[20:59:51] ChopperRCRG: things getting made quickly bc the artist is good = awesome. Things quickly because time cruch = mostly mediocre
[20:59:54] yvesdot: ^
[21:00:14] ChopperRCRG: which 3 was it
[21:00:35] yvesdot: I do think it is absolutely hilarious that she talked about how devastating the leak was because, you know, the music was unfinished, it's not how she wants to present it to her fans, etc.-- only for the CDs to ship and Sports Car to be unfinished!
[21:00:52] ChopperRCRG: also, I think one thing to say about the album is that it is heavily carried by the production. I don’t think any of the melodies are particularly enchanting.
[21:01:03] yvesdot: So if she really cares about serving finished material to her fans, why exactly was the leaked version of Sports Car identical to the unfinished physical version? Why are there unfinished songs going out to her most devoted fans?
[21:01:05] ChopperRCRG: Oh, that’s funny. I didn’t know about the sports car thing.
[21:01:22] yvesdot: Mind you I think it's absolutely hilarious. I mean she turned the situation into a huge PR stunt and I can admire and appreciate that. It's kind of a serve!!
[21:01:27] ChopperRCRG: Honestly, I just hate capitalism. I wish I could just listen to music.
[21:01:51] yvesdot: @ChopperRCRG Yep yep yep. The whole situation with physicals overall (very much not limited to this) is really sad... why is nothing FINISHED
[21:01:52] ChopperRCRG: I used to not believe the bad presses good thing but the more I follow pop music the more I realize it’s true
[21:02:08] yvesdot: Also I am in the Discord server I don't know if you are. But we could talk there instead of this tragic silent room
[21:02:23] ChopperRCRG: I’ve been learning more about how people’s attention spans have been shortening and I really do think that plays into this a lot
[21:02:43] ChopperRCRG: Oh yeah, I was gonna suggest that but then I forgot let’s discord
[21:03:49] yvesdot: Wahoo! OK I will try to find you in there
