[16:59:40] pig-serpent: I think not trying to court a mainstream audience as hard and also growing out of the early 10s build up drop structure has helped dance music out a lot
[16:59:42] vayyiqra: feeling shaky can be good
[16:59:43] Vexastrae: im mainly here to lurk and also update the spreadsheet when we reveal the winner
[16:59:50] Vexastrae: @pig-serpent soooo true

[17:24:16] Jayslay: hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii :3
[17:24:17] bogo: the thing is like no one is pressuring me to drink but i still feel so pressured to drink cause like so many people here do it anyways even though they're still technically underage
[17:24:18] froggy: shoutout synths
[17:24:20] RYNO: @Hypnotica lmfao
[17:24:20] froggy: hi jay!
[17:24:21] camerinian: i do feel like this may have got pushed up just thanks to the name brand
[17:24:33] Jayslay: hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii :3
[17:24:36] ignitephoenix: its only this high cause we have too many porter stans 2
[17:24:40] bogo: we need the us to just lower the fucking legal age to 18 or something it's so dumb
[17:24:44] Hypnotica: not the name brand
[17:24:59] kinghan: i liked the glitchiness in this one
[17:25:15] pig-serpent: You should be able to drink by showing your high school degree and no I'm not kidding

[17:25:33] WesternWind: heeeeyyy jay
[17:25:36] nonchalantthoughts: I believe the drinking age was raised to 21 in the US during the Reagan administration because too many teens were driving drunk

[17:25:43] Hypnotica: this is a hundred times better

[17:26:00] camerinian: they are both good!
[17:26:01] Hypnotica: :sob:
[17:26:05] camerinian: just similar zones of good
[17:26:21] nonchalantthoughts: but I do think it should be back to 18 because 18-21 yrs old drink anyways so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[17:26:31] hikk: here they jacked up alcohol prices to combat dangerous activity which might be worse than age ngl
[17:26:33] pig-serpent: Didn't the federal government bully states to raise drinking laws in exchange for infrastructer funding?
[17:26:54] nonchalantthoughts: i think so
[17:26:59] camerinian: that sounds like something the US would do yes
[17:27:07] pig-serpent: I get not wanting high schoolers to drink but having college kids unable to drink is fucked and just leads to more college kids going crazy and killing themselves
[17:27:11] vayyiqra: i read hirachi as hitachi lol
[17:27:16] Catalyst: Forgot I rated this pretty high cuz I‚Äôm an old af and it reminds me of Tekken
[17:27:21] bogo: @nonchalantthoughts it's always fucking reagan
[17:27:23] nonchalantthoughts: maybe we should just put that energy in better public transportation rather than raising the drinking age
[17:27:24] RYNO: yeah underage drinking isn't that enforced in the US. like you won't see the cops randomly breaking into a college apartment party
[17:27:24] pig-serpent: It would be much healthier to not make students drink in secret or whatever
[17:27:25] vayyiqra: @beeozan late but so true yes a 10-11
[17:27:25] bogo: that man was rotted
[17:27:37] impla: and now hes rotting

[17:28:47] pig-serpent: Zoning laws I think, yeah
[17:28:48] RYNO: also yeah I waited till I was 21 to start drinking. was really paranoid about it. I don't think it's wrong to drink earlier though
[17:28:53] froggy: love that this song brought about a sincere discussion of US drinking laws being shit lmao
