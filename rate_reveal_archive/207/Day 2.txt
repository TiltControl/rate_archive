[20:37:10] Roxie: need vlv to be the first song out day 3
[20:37:10] Jules: I guess meta rates being bad for kpop does not translate to city pop
[20:37:26] TakeOnMeByA-ha: i do not respect the amount of vlv disrespect im seeing in this queup

[20:38:39] BleepBloopMusicFan: *Carolina
[20:38:41] TakeOnMeByA-ha: they shouldve done a call me maybe twist at the end of this video where shania's backing band starts making out with each other
[20:38:52] Jules: Wow you're so right
[20:39:00] impla: unfortunately crj hadnt invented gay people yet
[20:39:12] ricki: there's nothing homoerotic about this video why would they do that
[20:39:15] ricki: slash s
[20:39:26] impla: anyway this next interlude... no one can guess who selected it
[20:39:28] beeozan: impla teaching me this video parodies some random flop guy from the 80s but i forgot his name already
