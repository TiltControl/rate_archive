[22:42:09] ignitephoenix: basically she got a fake positive test and was like uhhh then santana found out and was like go to a doctor to check properly and then she wasn't actually pregannt

[18:06:25] NervousLemon: Oh bop
[18:06:38] ignitephoenix: not the biggest lana fan but this is a classic
[18:06:41] NervousLemon: Nandos is decent for a chain
[18:06:51] NervousLemon: Although I haven't been in ages tbh
[18:06:51] impla: i think nandos has gotten pretty expensive unfortunately but i would recommend trying it!
[18:06:51] ignitephoenix: ive had nandos once and yeah its decent
[18:06:59] ignitephoenix: I had some chicken wrap thing
[18:07:10] ignitephoenix: tbt to when Niall was obsessed with nandos
[18:07:10] tea_kay: is nandos the one where you can get the peas
[18:07:15] noodles: hypeflation is real ;w;
[18:07:17] impla: ?
[18:07:19] NervousLemon: I think last time I was there was cause we had a vegan friend who was craving their faux nuggets
[18:07:30] impla: i dont think ive heard of that specifically tk 😭
[18:07:35] NervousLemon: So those have the stamp of approval
[18:07:49] flava: it's been so long since i've had a nandos
[18:07:54] NervousLemon: You know I'm not sure I've ever heard the non-remix version of this
[18:08:00] impla: FLAVA
[18:08:08] tea_kay: i remember when i was roadtripping through the UK about 10 years ago that we stopped at some fast food place where you made a plate of like meat + mashed potatoes + mushy green peas
[18:08:23] ignitephoenix: TIl you've been to the UK
[18:08:25] insanelyinshape: I'm curious about the correlation between BPM and rating... I feel like uptempo songs largely remain
[18:08:27] impla: oh yeah you can get meat and two sides at nandos
[18:08:39] impla: i didnt know they did mushy peas though
[18:08:43] noodles: oh i forgot how sad this mv is :((
[18:08:52] wathombe: i certainly know one downtempo song that remains
[18:08:57] tea_kay: oh i just checked and it was definitely not nandos
[18:09:01] ignitephoenix: @insanelyinshape popheads does prefer a bop over a ballad so we will see how long that lasts
[18:09:06] insanelyinshape: I assume that's a demographic basis
[18:09:07] tea_kay: it was like nursing home food basically
[18:09:08] insanelyinshape: yeah
[18:09:14] NervousLemon: Balladphobia is a condition characterised by
[18:09:16] impla: please 😭
[18:09:32] flava: mushy peas are delicious ntm
[18:09:37] impla: also i agree the remix is the definitive version for me
[18:09:38] noodles: @NervousLemon have you listened to the born to die album at all :0
[18:09:39] ignitephoenix: peas are kinda overrated
[18:09:52] wathombe: i've never heard this version [2]
[18:09:53] impla: british people love peas idk
[18:10:05] noodles: guysssss listen to the born to die album
[18:10:12] flava: im casually craving baked beans now
[18:10:19] insanelyinshape: I think these 3 albums work really well (from an album standpoint) bc of how they're structured
[18:10:21] noodles: well i guess it still does have sentimental value for me since it was the first album i got on vinyl as a kid
[18:10:21] ignitephoenix: peas given baby's first veggie to me and like adults who only eat peas and carrots for veggies I want to judge
[18:10:27] impla: i had a jacket potato yesterday

[20:08:32] ignitephoenix: another random video i found
[20:08:32] BleepBloopMusicFan: If we ever get that far
[20:08:37] insanelyinshape: I believe the actress never showered after filming that scene if I remember the story properly, only bathed
[20:08:40] noodles: @BleepBloopMusicFan what have u guys seen so far
[20:08:45] tea_kay: 3ds flipnote you will always be famous
[20:08:46] noodles: and what yr is the AFI top 100 from
[20:08:54] BleepBloopMusicFan: We've only gotten through the first five lol
[20:09:06] NervousLemon: This should have been day 3
[20:09:12] noodles: my most vivid memory of flipnote is my ex making me a flipnote to ask me out a while bacc
[20:09:13] impla: i want to watch more classic films as well
[20:09:32] BleepBloopMusicFan: Ben Hurr, Toy Story, Yankee Doodle Dandy, Blade Runner, Do The Right Thing, and The Last Picture Show
[20:09:37] BleepBloopMusicFan: So the first six actually
[20:09:39] impla: i was doing a randomiser from 1001 movies to watch before you die and one of the first ones it gave me was satantango
[20:09:42] noodles: oooooooh
[20:09:48] noodles: Do The Right Thing is so good
[20:09:49] impla: that shit is like 8 hours 😭
[20:10:02] noodles: I think I was bored by The Last Picture Show
[20:10:18] BleepBloopMusicFan: The Last Picture Show being my favorite so far
[20:10:20] noodles: I've yet to finish Ben Hurr but I often put that in a similar category as like, Lawrence of Arabia in my head
[20:10:37] BleepBloopMusicFan: Like I thought it was so compellingly bleak
[20:10:43] noodles: yea that one was bleak fs
[20:10:57] insanelyinshape: I think that's a fair comparison tbh
[20:11:02] noodles: @impla i watched satantango. it is not worf unless u rly rly like slow cinema
[20:11:02] BleepBloopMusicFan: Ben Hurr is over three hours long so not quite what impla ran into but it was a hell of a way to start
[20:11:19] noodles: i hardly remember it other than the opening and then i think i was checked out for like 5 hrs trying to watch
[20:11:37] impla: yeah i skipped when there was like 30 minutes of literally nothing happening
[20:11:51] BleepBloopMusicFan: The one I'm most excited for is maybe 12 Angry Men
[20:11:51] noodles: i'm not opposed to long movies. one of my fave movies is drive my car which is a perfect 3 hr runtime.
[20:11:58] BleepBloopMusicFan: We love a good dialogue based movie
[20:11:59] noodles: but it's hard to make that long of a movie that makes the best use of its runtime
