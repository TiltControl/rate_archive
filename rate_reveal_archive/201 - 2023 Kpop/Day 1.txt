[16:17:48] ricki: ag cook is doing what he can to salvage this song ig
[16:17:51] bigbigbee: and SNTY is definitely a 10
[16:17:54] impla: this is worse than i remember
[16:18:02] MK_dex: this is the A.G. cook remix impla
[16:18:05] ricki: we need jungkook to go back to his blunt bob lesbian cut
[16:18:06] gucci6629: this remix is kinda eating i'm ngl
[16:18:12] bigbigbee: you know this collab wasn't great cause no one tried to do yaoi of it
[16:18:16] gucci6629: i'm on my jung kook.
[16:18:18] ricki: ou
[16:18:21] vayyiqra: a **** ****
[16:18:21] MK_dex: also I hear some of y'all asking where the good music is the next interlude EATS I promise
[16:18:23] kerriekipje: oh this is why its out on day 1
[16:18:28] ricki: ag cook couldnt do anything with this part
[16:18:31] impla: bee you're so unhinged when it comes to kpop :'(
[16:18:38] MeijiDoom: @bigbigbee I was talking with some other people and it's totally possible JK has a song out on each of the three days
[16:18:38] gucci6629: the thinkpieces on twitter over jack's verse
[16:18:46] MeijiDoom: Pretty unique thing for a single artist in one year
[16:18:58] bigbigbee: @impla I'm so sorry I lost my decorum :sob:
[16:19:03] MK_dex: a song each day you say?

[16:19:07] kawaii_mokona: @MeijiDoom big agree, other people have a point
[16:19:09] MK_dex: bbb you're fine the background is literally the boyz - reveal
[16:19:09] MeijiDoom: Yeah
[16:19:17] bigbigbee: I just was on the allkpop forums in 2011 and that sleeper part of my brain gets reawakened during kpop reveals
[16:19:19] gucci6629: y'all can't make me dislike this song sorry it slays
[16:19:31] impla: jack harlowe GO AWAY
[16:19:37] MK_dex: for the next interlude I wasn't biased btw
[16:19:39] MeijiDoom: I really don't think it's that bad. It's just pretty generic, Timberlake sounding
[16:19:43] MK_dex: I could've went with * but they had enough rep in this rate
[16:19:46] MK_dex: so instead we have...
[16:19:47] MK_dex: MOTHERS
[16:19:49] MeijiDoom: and for some reason, people can really dislike generic intensely
[16:19:50] MK_dex: what's 3 Ds

[16:21:21] gucci6629: queen shit
[16:21:50] MK_dex: if it wasn't for the boyz bonus rate I would've picked D.D.D for the interlude
[16:21:54] MK_dex: but this song is too good
[16:22:08] SkylarV: the boyz would have been better
[16:22:14] ricki: this wins the ddd-off

[17:13:02] bran: there are so many worse songs left
[17:13:11] MeijiDoom: not to mention, it's so clearly altered lyrics for something that would be better
[17:13:14] SkylarV: not that many
[17:13:27] pbklol: i thought they were saying 90s this whole time. what the fuck does nineteens kitsch mean
[17:13:30] ricki: KOREAN NINETEENS KITSCH
[17:13:33] bigbigbee: They're roughly 19
[17:13:36] ricki: KITSCH KITSCH KITSCH KITSCH KITSCH
[17:13:37] Nagisoid: oh it's not 90s
[17:13:40] WesternWind: Spill ricki
[17:13:42] MeijiDoom: it's almost assuredly supposed to be 90s bitch
[17:13:45] ricki: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
[17:13:46] MeijiDoom: but you can't say that on korean tv
[17:13:52] MK_dex: this verse is so bad
[17:13:58] impla: well yes
[17:14:01] ricki: also not a single one of them were born in the 90s
[17:14:03] pbklol: yolo say no
[17:14:03] MeijiDoom: so of course, 19s kitsch, as if anyone's unironically used kitsch in like 20 years
[17:14:24] ricki: i think if they were repeating 90s bitch it would be corny
[17:14:30] pbklol: well
[17:14:31] pbklol: it is
[17:14:31] ricki: take that millenial ass shit to mamamoo

[17:14:45] bigbigbee: I thought it was a celebration of youth and fun
[17:14:48] bran: they could never make me hate u
[17:14:51] impla: i just accepted it
[17:14:52] bigbigbee: 19 being the old age of adulthood in Korea

[17:15:33] gucci6629: JENNIE.
[17:15:34] vayyiqra: BP have so much dogshit but then they drop heaters like this sometimes there is no scientific explanation
[17:15:37] kerriekipje: i was into kpop and deliberately skipped out on listening to this bc i was a bitter 2ne1 stan
[17:15:44] gucci6629: tea
[17:15:45] bigbigbee: i love that kerrie
[17:15:47] MeijiDoom: It's the tolerable version of the HYLT/Dx4/KTL trio
[17:15:49] ricki: blackpink with a dual concept (slayful song [boobayah] and horrid musical terrorism [whistle]) wow
[17:15:52] gucci6629: they don't make ggs like 2ne1 anymore it's sad...
[17:15:54] bigbigbee: I skipped it because I was a 2NE1 hater and transferred that onto them LOL
[17:15:57] kerriekipje: like
[17:15:57] bigbigbee: but now I like 2NE1
[17:15:59] MeijiDoom: even though the post-chorus is pretty cringey
[17:16:08] bran: ntm on whistle...
[17:16:10] MeijiDoom: verse made me like lisa as a rapper for a time though
[17:16:11] kerriekipje: they won me over with playing with fire tho
[17:16:13] bigbigbee: i was taylor swift in that one gif
[17:16:15] kerriekipje: and then they lost me with kill this love
[17:16:18] gucci6629: plssss
[17:16:25] jirachi: @bigbigbee are you a sone by any chance
[17:16:30] MeijiDoom: Also, probably the only song where I actually like Jisoo's tone
[17:16:31] Nagisoid: this is so trashpop
[17:16:32] jirachi: were you
[17:16:35] vayyiqra: so true nagi

[17:16:41] kerriekipje: this literally just being a 2ne1 song sjnfkmd,sfh
[17:16:42] bigbigbee: I WAS but i also had a brief fun year where I didn't like them either @jirachi
[17:16:53] jirachi: ouuuu
[17:16:54] bigbigbee: AIIYL is their most 2NE1 song and also their best song!
[17:16:57] bigbigbee: Playing With Fire also great tho

[17:17:30] bigbigbee: they lost me with The Boys though, I didn't like it
[17:17:31] bigbigbee: at the time
[17:17:37] gucci6629: omg...blasphemy
[17:17:37] ricki: listening to this helps me understand how and why blackpink became the biggest girl group

[17:39:40] MeijiDoom: background instrumental kinda going hard though
[17:39:40] kawaii_mokona: guilty pleasure bop
[17:39:47] MeijiDoom: sounds like a video game cinematic intro
[17:39:48] SkylarV: actively worse
[17:40:09] impla: 2  more songs?
[17:40:11] vayyiqra: this rules
[17:40:14] MK_dex: I'M ATHLETIC GIRL.

[17:40:23] MeijiDoom: ok these lyrics are atrocious
[17:40:28] kawaii_mokona: they really are
[17:40:29] MeijiDoom: but sonically, more interesting than rose blossom
[17:40:37] TakeOnMeByA-ha: why are they in the blackpink generic studio
[17:41:09] MeijiDoom: do the writers realize they could just give the singers full korean verses and like 95% chance, it'll just sound better?
[17:41:14] kawaii_mokona: The way Sitala left and Hwiseo is arguably the new center
[17:41:16] MK_dex: I'M ATHLETIC GIRL.
[17:41:19] MeijiDoom: I'm never sure what the random english interjections are meant to appeal to
[17:41:29] vayyiqra: i-fans who know english
[17:41:33] gucci6629: ^
[17:41:46] ricki: i sing the english parts of songs [2]

[17:42:14] TakeOnMeByA-ha: i think more kpop groups should just sing in full korean if international fans wanna sing along just learn korean. skill issue.
[17:42:15] MK_dex: I'M ATHLETIC GIRL.
[17:42:18] ricki: that said, i do kii when i listen to songs in spanish that throw random english phrases.... like oh... that's what koreans hear?
[17:42:22] bigbigbee: i would arguably argue that the english INTERJECTIONS in kpop are designed to appeal to the korean public
[17:42:24] vayyiqra: kurps right t ho

[17:45:13] MeijiDoom: @kerriekipje RHCP music you say
[17:45:16] kawaii_mokona: They wrote half a song and then decided to copy it
[17:45:21] pbklol: blinding lights with 0 sauce
[17:45:23] impla: this is the most 6 song ive ever heard
[17:45:23] ricki: i kinda want kpop stans to never use the word retro ever again
[17:45:44] kawaii_mokona: they don't know how to differentiate between the genres
[17:45:44] MeijiDoom: also the instrumental is just so monotonous
[17:45:56] ricki: like retro HOW because there's like 10 different trends that get thrown under "retro"
[17:45:56] kawaii_mokona: it's chasing that feeling
[17:46:01] MeijiDoom: i dont think the drums change at all for the entire song
[17:46:01] kawaii_mokona: and never finds it
[17:46:06] kerriekipje: this def sounds like if u asked an ai to generate a weeknd song
[17:46:09] vayyiqra: every synthwave-ish song is now blinding lights
[17:46:09] kawaii_mokona: so it makes sense
[17:46:10] MK_dex: a few of these final day 1 eliminations were day 2 for a lot of the rate so I'm kind of surprised by the final results
[17:46:12] Nagisoid: tbh kpop fans just call anything synthwave/nu disco retro nowadays
[17:46:13] bigbigbee: Wonder Girls started the retro thing with Nobody
[17:46:18] bigbigbee: T-ara perfected it with Roly Poly
[17:46:19] MK_dex: this, rose blossom, teddy bear, baddie, etc.
[17:46:19] MeijiDoom: 80s synth in the style of blinding lights is the main thing
[17:46:27] vayyiqra: wonder girls also did several kinds of retro ^^^
[17:46:32] kerriekipje: wait i know what this reminds me of this sounds like ava max
[17:46:34] kawaii_mokona: Take Me Home just does synthwave fun
