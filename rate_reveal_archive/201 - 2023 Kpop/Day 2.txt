[17:41:25] bran: attitude should've been the title
[17:41:26] bogo: the interludes are not hints

[17:44:47] bogo: i don't remember this song
[17:44:55] starlit: this was very mid
[17:44:56] bran: oh i forgot this is still in
[17:44:57] kerriekipje: this was the middest song of all the rate so this makes sense
[17:44:58] DraculaWeekend: sad
[17:44:58] kinghan: oh this one was pretty idk
[17:44:59] MeijiDoom: This song is Taeyeon trying to make NewJeans music
[17:45:00] bogo: i don't even remember what score i gave this :sob:
[17:45:05] pbklol: this is robbed
[17:45:06] MeijiDoom: it goes nowhere, does nothing
[17:45:09] Nagisoid: this was cute
[17:45:13] pbklol: it also does not sound like newjeans at all so
[17:45:14] impla: at least pbk has my back for once
[17:45:18] bran: this doesn't sound like newjeans at all??
[17:45:19] enric0ps: meiras
[17:45:26] kinghan: i don't see the newjeans comparison [2]
[17:45:34] MeijiDoom: I'm talking about structure and melodic contour
[17:45:35] vayyiqra: what newjeans song
[17:45:37] pbklol: this sounds like someone with a credit score made it
[17:45:39] MK_dex: what NJ song [2]
[17:45:45] MK_dex: like barely maybe hurt but like
[17:45:45] MK_dex: sdlkfjdlskjflskdjks
[17:45:47] Nagisoid: yeah this doesn't sound like any newjeans song
[17:45:47] MeijiDoom: there's like 0 evolution of the song and the melody is straight up boring
[17:45:48] vayyiqra: a bit
[17:45:54] Nagisoid: maybe the interlude in the get up mini idk
[17:45:58] MeijiDoom: i can barely tell where the verse transitions into the chorus
[17:46:09] vayyiqra: i think this is just saying you don't like newjeans
[17:46:10] impla: minimalist queen okkk
[17:46:18] MeijiDoom: I like Attention and Hype Boy
[17:46:21] vayyiqra: oh good
[17:46:24] MeijiDoom: just not anything they've come out with recently
[17:46:26] bran: how this score higher than shooting star...
[17:46:28] pbklol: i dont like newjeans but they have very notable choruses
[17:46:34] Nagisoid: rum pum pum
[17:46:37] kerriekipje: cuz this is better than shooting star
[17:46:37] bogo: i kinda underscored this tbh
[17:46:37] DraculaWeekend: i like this song but i agree it doesnt really go anywhere
[17:46:40] vayyiqra: f(x) mentioned
[17:46:47] bogo: it's a chill bop tbh
[17:46:50] kinghan: i liked the minimal feel to this one idk
[17:46:52] starlit: super shy going to double newjeans count at what cost
[17:46:58] starlit: newjeans win count
[17:47:03] bran: well yes
[17:47:07] bogo: not if pbk can help it
[17:47:13] MK_dex: korea living for this was very on-brand I fear
[17:47:26] MK_dex: fun fact: this replaced lip gloss in the rate
[17:47:30] starlit: (i say this as someone who loves Super Shy but does not find anything interesting in Ditto at all it is not my type of music why did you let it win a rate)
[17:47:32] bran: they'll eat up anything taeyeon releases
[17:47:33] bogo: wtf
[17:47:33] MK_dex: aka lip gloss was cut for this
[17:47:37] MK_dex: anyway
[17:47:39] bogo: if i knew that i would've tanked
[17:47:40] MK_dex: better yawn song next
[17:47:55] Zypker124: I thought the MV was paused at first
[17:48:02] MeijiDoom: already more interesting lol
[17:48:09] vayyiqra: what the hell was that opening image
[17:48:10] pbklol: can we play invu i miss her
[17:48:12] bran: 2
[17:48:25] MK_dex: this is a dem jointz prod.
[17:48:28] bogo: so basically what i've learned from 2023 kpop discourse is that korea has very low key taste
[17:48:31] vayyiqra: (i say this as someone who loves Super Shy but does not find anything interesting in Ditto at all it is not my type of music why did you let it win a rate) [2]
[17:48:43] impla: kinda the queen of go girl give us nothing
[17:48:43] bogo: ohhhhh yes i like this
[17:48:45] bran: because ditto is one of the best kpop songs ever...
[17:48:48] vayyiqra: is it
[17:49:03] MeijiDoom: I like Ditto a lot more than Super Shy
[17:49:11] Zypker124: Korea is riding the chill song trend now yeah
[17:49:12] MeijiDoom: Half of Super Shy's enjoyment for me is the choreo
[17:49:19] MK_dex: ditto clears super shy
[17:49:19] kinghan: this video is so mismatched to the song it's amusing
[17:49:20] lovemaze: supernova save us
[17:49:24] vayyiqra: 2
[17:49:29] MK_dex: hold on to that thought
[17:49:40] vayyiqra: this is a good ditty tho
[17:49:48] kinghan: rtt
[17:49:52] impla: this year and last year the most highly liked newjeans song has been the least interesting to me i fear
[17:49:55] vayyiqra: :cupcake:
[17:50:00] pbklol: the bunny era newjeans is ok (mostly :mario:) but the powerpuff ep extremely unpleasant
[17:50:01] impla: all bops tho
[17:50:06] impla: oh!
[17:50:08] MeijiDoom: Is this the sequel/prequel to Top or Cliff?
[17:50:26] kerriekipje: oh

[17:52:42] starlit: i've never heard this song before but like i'm attracted to the beat wtf
[17:52:43] kinghan: this is a bop and if i'm not misremembering i thought it was dragon ball themed or something
[17:52:44] Nagisoid: no it just sounds like anime music
[17:52:56] MK_dex: songogong = sun wu kong in chinese = monkey king/journey of the west for any of y'all who have heard of that
[17:52:57] bran: does it?
[17:52:57] MeijiDoom: yeah, the theme about this is sun wukong/goku
[17:53:04] Zypker124: @MeijiDoom No it's just DC so they'll always be associated with anime lols
[17:53:07] MK_dex: yes also dragon ball-themed
[17:53:07] bran: nothing about this reminds me of anime
[17:53:10] vayyiqra: i was !? at the journey to the west lore myself
[17:53:13] MK_dex: it's more in the lyrics
[17:53:15] Nagisoid: oh i meant bonvoyage lol

[17:53:23] Zypker124: God of Music was so much better, shame that song semi-flopped
[17:53:28] MurkyGalaxies: I'm glad for my own heart rate that I didn't see the baiting that just happened seeing from the reactions in the chat
[17:53:30] MeijiDoom: yeah the lyrics talk about straight up anime elements like "ending song"
[17:53:30] kinghan: this video is so dudes rock
[17:53:32] starlit: speaking of anime music does anyone else find the Ive pokemon ost to be better than all of their post-After Like singles

[18:04:10] Nagisoid: it won
[18:04:13] starlit: [this track made starlit's day!}
[18:04:13] Nagisoid: of all the loona solos
[18:04:14] Zypker124: Well this song at least won the bonus rate of popheads's 1st K-Pop rate
[18:04:20] vayyiqra: good
[18:04:34] Zypker124: Glad we gave Heart Attack the W over this though
[18:04:34] starlit: i will be stopping because uhhhh.... i don't trust bbc to try suing the girls for a third time
[18:04:47] Nagisoid: the girls just won another lawsuit against them lol
[18:04:52] MeijiDoom: like she has no say in this obviously but to me, it comes across like someone trying to sing more mature than they actually are
[18:04:55] kerriekipje: idk i just cant get into this song for whatever reason
[18:04:58] starlit: i gotta get this outta my search history aaaaaaaaaa
[18:05:03] WesternWind: 50 50 cries in the corner
[18:05:12] Zypker124: @MeijiDoom That's just all of K-Pop
[18:05:18] WesternWind: They still haven’t announced the new 50-50 lineup
[18:05:39] starlit: i also just remembered that i accidentaly clicked a link for Germany's national football team NFTs so time to nuke that part of my history as well
[18:05:41] MeijiDoom: @Zypker124 also glad Heart Attack ended up winning
[18:05:55] Nagisoid: i think most 50 50 fans are boycotting the comeback anyway
[18:05:59] Nagisoid: mess
[18:06:06] MurkyGalaxies: +1 happy Heart Attack won
[18:06:09] starlit: wait oprah it's not there, this is

[18:07:19] starlit: okay the German football NFTs have been removed
[18:07:19] Zypker124: Seven should make Top 7 (at least)
[18:07:28] Nagisoid: y'all are asking for the wrong songs to go out
[18:07:31] bran: seven will get a score of 7
[18:07:41] Zypker124: @Nagisoid So true it's time for Sugarcoat and Rover actually

[18:26:09] Zypker124: This song has one of the lowest controversy scores of any song on kpoprates so a 0 is kinda surprising

[18:31:00] vayyiqra: it's kind of funny
[18:31:12] MeijiDoom: End of the MV actually gets weirdly dark

[18:31:46] Zypker124: Snowball fights are horribly overrated to begin with tbh
[18:31:54] vayyiqra: ye

[19:26:32] Zypker124: It'll be fun for the hosts of 2024 K-Pop to try and figure out how Girl's Night can get in that rate (since it kinda flopped)
[19:26:49] LilacDaffodils: except bonito generation was good
[19:26:49] SkylarV: girls night winner

[19:28:17] vayyiqra: it is intentional
[19:28:21] Zypker124: This was the most iconic numbered sense K-Pop song until NCT U debut's came out
[19:28:21] vayyiqra: dystopian vibes

[19:29:03] MK_dex: well can they sing like this
[19:29:11] MeijiDoom: kinda true
[19:29:25] MeijiDoom: they're kind of afraid to give girl groups any song that's remotely sensual anymore. I guess other than Viviz
[19:29:29] MeijiDoom: and Kiss of Life kind of
[19:29:42] MK_dex: maybe if belle/lily/monday/ningning were in a supergroup

[19:35:34] bogo: @MeijiDoom surejan
[19:35:36] beeozan: left right is better than half the songs left lowkey

[19:35:39] Nagisoid: future songeniality
[19:35:44] kerriekipje: i forgot xg is still in
[19:35:54] SkylarV: newjeans triple out would be perfect
[19:35:56] DraculaWeekend: left right is objectively just a great pop song
[19:36:00] Zypker124: I doubt this is making the 2024 rate tbh
[19:36:06] kinghan: this lil momoko-esque flute aa
[19:36:07] Nagisoid: it probably is simply bc it's newjeans
[19:36:09] vayyiqra: how will you know if someone doesn't like newjeans in a kpop rate: don't worry they'll tell you
[19:36:24] beeozan: the flute is so out of mystical composer [2]
[19:36:30] kerriekipje: i dont like newjeans
[19:36:31] vayyiqra: beeo is so real for getting it
[19:36:37] Zypker124: @Nagisoid But they also release like 10 singles a year and this was definitely one of their less popular ones
[19:36:45] MeijiDoom: They're slowly turning into the next blackpink in terms of being a lightning rod of hate
[19:36:53] Zypker124: We
[19:36:56] Nagisoid: i think they're going in the dungeon after the japanese release
[19:36:58] lovemaze: oh mhj
[19:36:59] pbklol: if only thatd reflect in their rate performance
[19:37:01] Jayslay: oh godielle
[19:37:02] Zypker124: *We'll have to see how Supernatural and Right Now do
[19:37:02] Nagisoid: due to the hybe drama
[19:37:09] MeijiDoom: Honestly, melody ain't bad
[19:37:09] Nagisoid: so i doubt we'll have many songs to pick from
[19:37:24] MK_dex: VIVIZ would eat up this song
[19:37:30] MeijiDoom: it's still vibe music but it's solid
[19:37:38] Nagisoid: newjeans heard yukika retired and came to the rescue
[19:37:43] pbklol: this is very much naptime music but i dont hate it
[19:37:43] vayyiqra: imthankful
[19:37:55] bogo: still don't know how mhj managed to win that case
[19:38:02] Nagisoid: she did not fully
[19:38:06] Nagisoid: but it's very complicated
[19:38:11] Zypker124: The fact that this song isn't bubblegum pop automatically makes it 0-worthy
[19:38:37] beeozan: does it
[19:38:41] Jayslay: nope lol
[19:38:41] vayyiqra: does it
[19:38:43] Zypker124: Yes
[19:38:43] MeijiDoom: False advertising
[19:38:49] MeijiDoom: I think that's grounds for a lawsuit
[19:38:50] bogo: there are no 0 worthy newjeans songs
[19:38:51] Zypker124: Check the facts go check that
[19:38:51] SkylarV: it does

[19:40:38] Zypker124: (Might age poorly for 2024)
[19:40:43] bogo: idt aespa has ever been 2024 :sob:

[19:40:55] bogo: help i meant top 10
[19:41:00] Zypker124: @MK_dex This year is a confirmation
[19:41:15] pbklol: aespa has a rep for tanking on popheads
[19:41:18] MK_dex: I was replying to zypker
[19:41:22] pbklol: if anything this is overperforming for them
[19:41:26] bogo: it was deserved for a long time
[19:41:27] vayyiqra: i remember when next level and savage were beloved and uncontroversial on popheads
[19:41:37] SkylarV: overperforming [2]
[19:41:43] pbklol: next level was a supreme grower (it took like 4 years)
[19:41:44] MK_dex: I don't think next level was ever uncontroversial
[19:41:44] DraculaWeekend: Drama is better than both of those
[19:41:50] MK_dex: neither was savage actually
[19:41:54] Zypker124: Also I wasn't saying that like it was a new fact, I was just saying thank god it was the case
[19:41:57] vayyiqra: @MK_dex that's the joke
[19:41:58] pbklol: next level a 10 i didnt get it for a while
[19:42:00] bogo: both songs were always bad
[19:42:00] pbklol: this just sucks tho
[19:42:06] lovemaze: drama better than spicy

[19:42:32] bogo: ive once again grossly overperforming
[19:42:38] Zypker124: Everyone is talking at least 30 degrees to the right of everyone else

[19:48:18] Zypker124: Fighting left before Day 3 to win songeniality
[19:48:18] Nagisoid: vote this for songeniality so ateez doesn't win
[19:48:20] SkylarV: worse songs still in!
[19:48:22] pbklol: so true
[19:48:27] MeijiDoom: Freaking cupid still around lol
[19:48:28] DraculaWeekend: songeniality fr
[19:48:40] impla: cupid so innocent
[19:48:56] lovemaze: we need cupid out now
[19:49:07] pbklol: this song rules
[19:49:08] MeijiDoom: I mean, I'd be down for Queencard, Spicy or Maniac to go but I assume they'll stay because they're "serving"
[19:49:09] DraculaWeekend: Cuoid and fast forward wtf
[19:49:21] Nagisoid: fast forward so close to day 3 yass
[19:49:22] Zypker124: All the 3-song artists were kind enough to have one of their songs leave Day 1 but NewJeans didn't get the memo
[19:49:28] Jayslay: cupid and fast forward some of the few good songs in the rate
[19:49:43] DraculaWeekend: no
[19:49:46] bogo: xg last elim of day 2 please
[19:49:56] bogo: or queencard cause it would be really fucking funny
[19:50:00] MeijiDoom: This is really the evidence that boy songs can't win though. This is like the polar opposite of Stray Kids and they're still going out at 25
[19:50:00] impla: i would say nct out but the men have had it hard enough
[19:50:05] pbklol: queencard top 10
[19:50:06] WesternWind: Rip fighting

[19:50:23] Jayslay: we forget in bloom is in.. like its winning
[19:50:25] pbklol: wait htis is a woman??
[19:50:26] Jayslay: its just the songs fault 2
[19:50:33] WesternWind: Oh I know pbk
[19:50:34] bogo: THIS LITERALLY HAS A WOMAN ON IT AND IT STILL TANKED
[19:50:35] Nagisoid: :sob:
[19:50:39] vayyiqra: unnecessurrrry
[19:50:54] MeijiDoom: menow is like the knock off of the knock off of good fromis_9 songs
[19:50:56] pbklol: the way the end of day 2 isnt even tanking
[19:50:57] MeijiDoom: and yet it's making Day 3
[19:51:09] vayyiqra: good !
[19:51:15] Zypker124: So what I'm hearing is that we need to put a male feature on all the female songs to level the playing field
[19:51:15] kinghan: i kind of like this more now than i did during the rate
[19:51:15] kinghan: sorry bss
