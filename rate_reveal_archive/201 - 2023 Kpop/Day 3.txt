[19:10:48] MeijiDoom: I didn't realize a bad trumpet sample is enough to beat a well made song
[19:10:53] DraculaWeekend: this should have been top 10
[19:10:55] Nagisoid: the lyrics...........
[19:11:00] euphiemyra: so are XG J-pop
[19:11:06] Jayslay: no
[19:11:10] MeijiDoom: well they sing in english
[19:11:10] Hypnotica: oh brother
[19:11:11] MeijiDoom: so not really
[19:11:12] milkywayinradius: XG properly using an annoying voice like harvey
[19:11:14] pbklol: theyre japanese people making kpop imo
[19:11:14] Nagisoid: oh neptune
[19:11:27] Jayslay: i consider them kpop idc theyre promoting in korea so
[19:11:28] pbklol: jpop dont rly sound like this
[19:11:29] Jayslay: and under a kr label
[19:11:33] Nagisoid: yeah they have a kpop, not jpop sound
[19:11:35] kawaii_mokona: yall hating on english, meanwhile queencard still there
[19:11:39] MeijiDoom: for real
[19:11:43] pbklol: queencard amaze
[19:11:44] Zypker124: The never-ending debate lol
[19:11:49] vayyiqra: queencard barely counts as english !
[19:11:54] Nagisoid: look so cool
[19:12:20] MeijiDoom: a song that actually uses their rappers and singers well. and they don't make top 20
[19:12:23] euphiemyra: queencard transcends language
[19:12:28] vayyiqra: yes !
[19:12:41] euphiemyra: and I was kidding around about XG but ty for explaining genuinely
[19:12:46] ricki: my verdict is that if xg arent' kpop, they are close enough to the industry that it's fine to just include them in conversations about kpop either way
[19:12:51] euphiemyra: this is my yearly education in K-pop
[19:12:55] Hypnotica: when aliens come to earth we should play them queencard to show we are peaceful
[19:13:02] ignitephoenix: i can't tell if people ironically like queen card or not
[19:13:05] Hypnotica: tea ricki
[19:13:13] pbklol: queencard is a great song idc
[19:13:16] vayyiqra: it began as a meme but now i just unironically like it
[19:13:17] Nagisoid: queencard slays
[19:13:21] Hypnotica: queencard unironically amazer
[19:13:32] MeijiDoom: i'm just surprised it's lasted this long. I know it has its shooters but you would think the haters would have dragged it into elimination by now
[19:13:32] ricki: i was never ironic with my love for queencard
[19:13:34] ricki: like it's just fun
[19:13:37] pbklol: real
[19:13:40] bran: they perform at korean shows and they were at kcon too
[19:13:49] pbklol: i think a song can be funny without being ironic
[19:13:51] Zypker124: Will Super Lady or Wife make Day 3 as well is the real question
[19:13:55] Nagisoid: they won't
[19:13:57] ricki: no
[19:13:57] DraculaWeekend: no
