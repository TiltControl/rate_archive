[00:29:41] TiltControls: @flava wait isn't she?
[00:29:42] cheatviathan: Finger Eleven's two hits were some of their weaker songs tbh. Stream the Burnout 3 classic "Stay in Shadow" for some good angst.
[00:30:03] flava: oh i saw cancon i thought you were referring to KT
[00:30:07] SteelStepladder: And as for the next decade we should cover... with a whopping 50% of the vote it went to the 90's!!!
