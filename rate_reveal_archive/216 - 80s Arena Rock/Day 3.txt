[20:07:56] impla: the way this isnt even top 5 on born in the usa.. ok maybe im exaggerating
[20:08:24] countryrockdiva89: Unpopular opinion: 57 Channels and Nothin' On from 1992's Human Touch is a HUGE favorite of mine by Bruce.
[20:08:31] wathombe: i watched the origin of the traveling wilburys feature with my dad friday night before i flew back. so good.
[20:08:37] seanderlust: oooooh good picks
[20:08:38] wathombe: speaking of petty and collabs
[20:08:44] bigbigbee: Born To Run would be a good charity rate pick since we're more likely to rate Born in the USA in an album rate

[20:46:59] wathombe: exactly noncha
[20:47:04] TiltControls: some of these placements could probably swap around truthfully but i was just glad popheads let so many of these bangers hit 8+
