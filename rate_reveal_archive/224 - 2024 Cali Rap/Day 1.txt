[19:49:11] jacksboredtoday: i do think the two real diss songs in this are better than like 80% of drake material this decade (and her loss is the only thing keeping it from being an even higher number)

[18:43:10] king: this verse is actually so disgusting.....
[18:43:17] king: let me go delete my nokia scrobbles
[18:43:53] king: drake knew we'd get tired of hearing him so he called in guests for the track at least
[18:43:55] seanderlust: this verse is not even one where it's fun to make fun of
[18:43:58] TakeOnMeByA-ha: the upvoter switched to a downvote :sicko:
[18:44:11] goorry12: the upvoter was bee
[18:44:54] seanderlust: this song is the best argument that drake has ghostwriters, which is not a big deal if he does but it's clear this was written by drake
[18:45:19] seanderlust: if i was a rapper and had a ghostwriter that sent me this song i would venmo request my money back
[18:45:22] bigbigbee: this is very cringe, which is not this song's biggest fault
[18:45:38] king: song so bad it made ai tupac the 2nd worst
[18:45:39] crimsonroset: stop talking!!!
[18:45:47] Roxie: wow we really let this play in full huh
[18:45:51] crimsonroset: this is like when nicki just started ranting at the end of big foot
[18:45:56] seanderlust: WFDJIOHGVFAJKBLSDGLHSDNF
[18:45:57] stealthamo: the entire song is just drake going "i'm not owned. please stop saying that i'm owned."
[18:46:08] goorry12: this managed to be the worst diss track in 2024 in a year where big foot dropped
[18:46:15] seanderlust: lil wayne was really the only one of the YM big three that didn't entirely crash out in 2024 huh

[20:01:12] seanderlust: that is what this song makes me feel
[20:01:16] wathombe: makes it the 5th highest ever
[20:01:18] bigbigbee: no, tell me more about the fight you witnessed in real life
[20:01:23] Jules: god this is so fucking isnane
[20:01:26] wathombe: and the highest bonus by far
[20:01:27] goorry12: im what the culture feeling
[20:01:45] seanderlust: there was a guy that got into a fight with someone in my HS cafeteria
[20:01:56] bigbigbee: i did witness a fight in real life but it was two middle school boys so both of them sucked at it
[20:02:05] bigbigbee: it was funny though
[20:02:05] seanderlust: and he was the instigator, so kind of legitimately asked for it
[20:02:15] Vexastrae: oh so like drake
[20:02:22] seanderlust: but at a certain point it got really embarassing
[20:02:23] Vexastrae: diva
[20:02:26] Jules: This was such a serve for haters
[20:02:30] seanderlust: it was overkill
[20:02:30] pbklol: she aint no diva

[20:02:34] Roxie: i remember in 10th grade the morning of my AP world exam a brawl broke out in the cafe and it was so crazy
[20:02:39] Roxie: it was like 7:28am
[20:02:44] seanderlust: .dfwmnkjhbdkjrf
[20:02:49] Jules: Haters didn't even need the support but kendrick was here for us
[20:02:50] seanderlust: why does the time make it that much better
[20:02:52] goorry12: did the dude who made the video even looked at genius when making the video
[20:02:59] BleepBloopMusicFan: Bruh there's so many insane lines in this
[20:03:08] Roxie: thistbh
[20:03:09] Catalyst: a fight at 7:28 am is just diabolical

[20:03:36] jacksboredtoday: the Joel Osteen line :skull:
[20:03:43] Catalyst: that was deep
[20:03:47] seanderlust: mentally, i'm back in the high school cafeteria, staring at my mashed potatoes, afraid to look directly at the fight
[20:03:48] Vexastrae: this crodie verse is hilarious
