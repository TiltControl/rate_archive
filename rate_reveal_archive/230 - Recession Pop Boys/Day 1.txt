[19:00:07] pietro: sorry this is totally unrelated but was someone supposed to tell me that fantano made a video with the swiftologist or was I supposed to figure that out myself
[19:00:40] goorry12: i found out about it this morning

[19:01:07] ignitephoenix: like what kind of crossover

[19:01:19] wathombe: kind of crazy there's no official video for this
[19:01:59] ignitephoenix: i don't think zach cares about making music videos
[19:02:07] wathombe: oh, that makes sense
[19:02:20] wathombe: they should make one with just kacey then
[19:02:28] pietro: did Swiftologist shade fantano before this or something and this is like them working it out on the remix?
[19:02:51] Soalai: He's mentioned disagreeing with his reviews and such, but no real beef AFAIK
[19:03:07] Soalai: It seems like Fontana reached out for this particular vid

[20:16:25] stealthamo: jason derulo was one of the only good parts of the movie
[20:16:41] frajer: makes sense he basically is a cat who fucks
[20:16:41] stealthamo: he was the only one who understood the assignment of being as overbearingly horny as possible
[20:16:47] Roxie: :sob:
[20:16:53] jacksboredtoday: like this is uncomfortably horny but that's literally just understanding the source material
[20:17:03] Roxie: one day ill be forced to see cats
[20:17:10] ignitephoenix: jason truly does understand horny so this checks out
[20:17:31] jacksboredtoday: rebel wilson very solidly the worst part of cats

[19:55:18] fava: my man was just very honest that he was gonna break some hearts, nothing misogynistic about that
[19:55:29] Roxie: he was communicating his feelings [2]
[19:55:42] pietro: @Roxie hey that's not true because a lot of these songs still get played at younger ge z parties
[19:55:45] jacksboredtoday: its a courteous warning so you don't get blindsided if you go forward with the relationship
[19:55:50] Catalyst: We need that one Rainbow rate YESTERDAY
[19:56:16] fava: rainbow vs that whitney album vs all for you vs that kylie album with spinning around the legendiana you are
[19:56:17] pietro: granted I don't really go to parties but people went wild for some of these songs at my senior prom
[19:56:26] jacksboredtoday: i will nag akane again to resend rainbow/all for you/light years i wanna say music was the 4th?
[19:56:38] jacksboredtoday: oh yeah whitney was the 4th my love is your love SO iconic
[19:56:45] Catalyst: I feel like Music would get dragged
[19:56:52] jacksboredtoday: we kinda need to let its not right but its okay be her third 10+ average winner

[19:57:43] uiscebeathaoir: i love all four albums and artists in that rainbow rate a lot but i fear it's not the most cohesive
[19:57:44] jacksboredtoday: like to be so slay that a song as perfect as your disco needs you wouldn't snag my 11
[19:57:50] pietro: whats the theme for that
[19:58:06] frajer: late period divas or something
[19:58:08] uiscebeathaoir: its two latge 90's hip hop r&amp;b albums versus two early 2000's dance/electropop albums
[19:58:09] jacksboredtoday: something like turn of the millennium comebacks was the name iirc
[19:58:11] Catalyst: Turn of millennium pop I think
[19:58:19] uiscebeathaoir: like there's a clear divide down the middle
[19:58:41] uiscebeathaoir: I think either pairing would be perfection but as a four idk
[19:58:43] fava: this is the most 2000s sequence in the history of the world
[19:59:07] Catalyst: We need more pop stars fighting

[20:22:11] Catalyst: Sigh
[20:22:14] BleepBloopMusicFan: Nooo I kinda wanted to see if they randomly included Brockhampton
[20:22:17] pietro: rate villain defeated
[20:22:19] impla: pls
[20:22:19] TiltControls: aw
[20:22:19] fava: the wanted kinda ended 1D
[20:22:28] impla: this bop actually
[20:22:41] BleepBloopMusicFan: This actual poetry
[20:22:41] jacksboredtoday: and i do also wanna say: songeniality coming but y'all let two songs tie for the honor
[20:22:43] BleepBloopMusicFan: Like
[20:22:45] tea_kay: im pretty sure in terms of chart points this is bigger than any 1D song in the US
[20:22:51] Roxie: i think so much about the wanted 1d twitter fights
[20:22:52] ImADudeDuh: let tk break the tie
[20:22:56] ImADudeDuh: it is tk
[20:23:03] apatel27: of course its set in ibiza
[20:23:13] ImADudeDuh: I specifically remember this beating what makes you beautiful in the year-end
[20:23:25] impla: honestly deserved
[20:23:27] akanewasright: is songeniality closed :skull:
[20:23:34] Roxie: doing this rate i realized i think i have more nostalgia for chasing the sun than this
[20:23:40] jacksboredtoday: i already reported it to my cohost so
[20:23:46] pietro: this song is like the bridge between recession pop and stomp clap hey
[20:23:49] akanewasright: damn
[20:23:52] BleepBloopMusicFan: They look like such douchebags, but like that's somehow part of the appeal.
[20:23:53] pietro: does that make any sense
[20:24:00] akanewasright: ~~I didnt see it in the reddit thread or chat so~~
[20:24:20] impla: the way i know most of their names bc of their appearances in celebrity versions of quiz shows
[20:24:27] Soalai: Ack OK songeniality
[20:25:04] Roxie: it was linked at the start of the day akane
[20:25:05] pietro: congratulations Dynamite

[20:25:50] tea_kay: i am rooting for Down
[20:25:52] BleepBloopMusicFan: Did anyone else vote Eenie Meenie for songeniality?
[20:25:53] BleepBloopMusicFan: :sob:
[20:25:54] impla: usher is taking it fear
[20:26:02] fava: 1/6/11
[20:26:08] TiltControls: they're all so good but if I had to choose an order I'd do Dynamite &gt; Down &gt; DJ
[20:26:13] TiltControls: But i'd be happy with any
[20:26:17] BleepBloopMusicFan: Not Flava with the actually perfect spread
[20:26:18] NervousLemon: DJ &gt; Dynamite &gt; Down
[20:26:24] apatel27: 10/10/10
[20:26:29] fava: god intended it this way
[20:26:30] apatel27: would prefer a dynamite or down win
[20:26:41] uiscebeathaoir: the way mine's also 1/6/11 i think
[20:26:47] akanewasright: usher win a lil overdue but all great winners imo
[20:26:50] Roxie: each one kinda feel like the correct rate winner for this kinda rate
[20:26:52] NervousLemon: 8.8 / 10 / 11
[20:26:53] BleepBloopMusicFan: Ideal outcome would be Down for me
[20:27:01] fava: i feel like usher randomly got a 0 or 2 and then taio takes it
[20:27:05] BleepBloopMusicFan: But I think that's probably next up
[20:27:07] fava: which would be fucked up i cant lie
[20:27:11] ImADudeDuh: 10 10 11
[20:27:18] wathombe: 7 8 8.5 left for me

[20:27:36] akanewasright: grammy nominated video btw
[20:27:38] jacksboredtoday: this is kinda video of the decade a bit
[20:27:42] akanewasright: like
[20:27:56] BleepBloopMusicFan: I just think a song with the lyric "Down like the economy" is the spiritually correct outcome.
[20:28:16] wathombe: i've never seen the video, actually (though i've always loved the song)
[20:28:27] akanewasright: my baby!

[20:31:23] jacksboredtoday: though there were also a lot of requests for Luda and Pitbull to get guest verse calls again

[20:38:40] Roxie: they are all 11 coded but i feel like the 11 spread this rate means that people either 11ed their poor meow meow or the song thats in second got all the 11s
[20:38:44] akanewasright: if dynamite has no 11s just add one for my dad its one of like 10 pop songs from the 2010s he latched onto
[20:38:48] stealthamo: i only have a single 10 left among the final 3

[20:55:00] Roxie: honestly i kinda love the amount of solo 11s this rate had

[20:56:08] NervousLemon: SO BABY TONIGHT
