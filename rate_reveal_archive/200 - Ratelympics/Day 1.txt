[15:42:40] jirachi: odyssey gets so boring
[15:42:41] Nagisoid: i haven't played odyssey i fear
[15:42:42] baconshoes: super mario galaxy and sonic adventure innocent
[15:42:43] Hypnotica: its got quite a lot of flaws i wont get into here!
[15:42:48] Nagisoid: the last nintendo system i had was a 3ds shakey
[15:42:50] pbklol: ive replayed odyssey like 20 times
[15:42:53] baconshoes: i meant super mario odyssey but yeah
[15:42:55] pbklol: thats my game
[15:42:58] Hypnotica: its a nice enough 1 time playthrough
[15:43:02] TiltControls: odyssey great game but if we're ranking 3d marios it might be at the bottom for me
[15:43:10] hikk: odyssey not better than galaxies but better than 64 and sunshine oop oop
[15:43:11] pbklol: galaxy 2 the worst 3d mario and its not close
[15:43:12] BleepBloopMusicFan: I like it more than Galaxy tbh
[15:43:12] TiltControls: but that's just cause of the field
[15:43:15] pbklol: they made the same game but worse
[15:43:15] Hypnotica: but it falls apart trying to complete it... which is bad for a collectathon imo
[15:43:17] Nagisoid: 64 really shows its age i fear
[15:43:17] Vexastrae: objectively well made but its a bit standard for me i fear
[15:43:18] Hypnotica: pbk im
[15:43:21] Hypnotica: that is an awful take
[15:43:26] Nagisoid: the only 3d mario i really like is galaxy
[15:43:29] jirachi: galaxy 1 &gt; 2 &gt; sunshine &gt; 64 &gt; odyssey

[15:44:19] Hypnotica: in what world
