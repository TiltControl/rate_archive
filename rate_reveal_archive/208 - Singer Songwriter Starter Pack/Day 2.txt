[21:52:28] CarlieScion: yes
[21:52:39] handmadeh3aven: oh that's
[21:52:41] pbklol: i read the summary for this movie a few months ago bc apparently there was beef between the author and the director bc they changed the ending
[21:52:51] handmadeh3aven: i haven't read or watched it
[21:53:26] CarlieScion: the movie ends with the cancer-sister asking the organ-sister to refuse donations bc she wants to die
[21:53:49] pbklol: doesnt the book end w them both dying
[21:53:56] CarlieScion: no
[21:54:11] CarlieScion: in the book the organ!sister ends up saying yes to the donation but dies in a car crash
[21:54:17] CarlieScion: and thus cancer!sister gets the organ
[21:54:25] pbklol: oh yeah
[21:54:36] Hypnotica: the movie ending FAR better

[21:56:22] pbklol: when the interlude is sabrina carpenter a second time

[22:18:34] Roxie: there was this band that opened for aly &amp; aj two years ago that had such horrid mixing that wasnt their fault but it caused my ears to start ringing so bad i had to leave when aly and aj came onstage
[22:18:46] Roxie: i had gotten the ticket for free 3 hours before so it wasnt all bad but it sucked
[22:18:53] Roxie: and so i bought a vinyl cause i felt bad and left

[20:48:10] goorry12: An equal song
[20:48:14] goorry12: 2 queens
[20:48:16] Jules: this being a literally horrible song
[20:48:20] Jules: like one of the worst on ttpd
[20:48:21] pbklol: bzzt incorrect
[20:48:34] WesternWind: Exactly goory
[20:48:34] bogo: this would have potential with a completely different chorus
[20:48:55] ricki: i like it but i also dont feel any offense when people dont
[20:48:57] ricki: like with most of ttpd
[20:48:57] pbklol: im gonna start talking abt stuff other ppl play the way ppl talk when anyone plays taylor
[20:48:58] WesternWind: Surprised she used Aston Martin
[20:49:12] WesternWind: Pls
[20:49:14] ricki: clcok it pbk
[20:49:15] ricki: ill join you
[20:49:16] bogo: and also it needs more dynamic production like literally all of this album
[20:49:24] goorry12: I think the magbay album fits the best with brat but i don't think we have an idea for a lineup outside of that
[20:49:24] WesternWind: but also 📸
[20:49:34] pbklol: like im sry the pregame is for vibing out dislike songs in silence

[20:51:37] pbklol: magbay has more monthly listeners than all 4 artists in cyberrock by over a million
[20:51:40] pbklol: i truly just do not see it
[20:51:55] bogo: well they did just put out an album
[20:52:15] Jules: Many things have been said in the past two minutes while I was gone
[20:52:33] pbklol: this is true but porter also has a mega hit backing him up and he still only has 2M
[20:52:39] goorry12: Also i feel like if we put magbay in cyberrock the only songs that will put a fight is cheerleader
[20:52:53] bogo: ugh fiiiiine
[20:52:55] pbklol: and cheerleader is not good
[20:53:00] Jules: but let me just say I truly think the pregame is for getting your hating game going so you can go into the reveal with an anger
[20:53:03] pbklol: sorry djlgasdgjj its fine im bullying
[20:53:20] bogo: can we cheat and rate eusexua first cycle of 2025 with brat and magbay
[20:53:24] Jules: And that cyberrock feels based on vibes and nobody caring for the underscores
[20:53:29] Jules: like im sorry
[20:53:36] pbklol: i care!!
[20:54:07] goorry12: Underscores fits so well in the lineup, i don't care that it's flopping hard
[20:54:14] pbklol: yeule is the true khia to me like what songs of theirs would even do well
[20:54:21] bogo: yeah i feel like most people's scores for underscores would be 10s/11s for girls like us and old money bitch and like 5s/6s for the rest of the album
[20:54:33] pbklol: we need girls like us rate winner
[20:54:47] Jules: tbh I just think the rate can do with like a public fave
[20:54:54] Jules: like chappell was for slumber party pop
[20:54:57] bogo: dazies is coming to sweep
[20:55:10] goorry12: Who
[20:55:18] pbklol: chappell honestly wasnt that much bigger than remi or hemlocke when slumber party got picked honestly
