[19:00:08] ricki: ill be honest,,, it's been so long that the BNA category nominated artists that have beena round for a minute but just blew up recently that i think that if you dont realize it's just a "best breakthrough artist" award, that's on you
[19:00:21] wathombe: victoria and samara want words, @tea_kay
