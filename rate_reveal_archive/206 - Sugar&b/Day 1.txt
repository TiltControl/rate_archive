[20:50:22] Roxie: this horrible wall these horrible outfits but the best song ever
[20:50:24] creme: perries corset in this video haunts me genuinely

[20:50:33] WesternWind: 2
[20:50:34] Roxie: why did they do that to her
[20:50:35] Hypnotica: well actually yeah the 1D answers were probably all not pointless :skull:

[21:13:28] BleepBloopMusicFan: Ngl the only really strong opening track in this rate for me was Smoke
[21:13:52] pbklol: im gonna go out on a limb and say smoke is next
[21:13:56] pbklol: oh thats unfortunate timing
[21:13:57] BleepBloopMusicFan: Now
[21:14:05] akanewasright: i like moment as an opener but not as much as like a *song*
[21:14:15] BleepBloopMusicFan: Yeah
[21:14:18] akanewasright: like i like it, but mostly bc its great at setting the atmosphere for the album
[21:14:19] creme: next elim is kinda unfortunate
