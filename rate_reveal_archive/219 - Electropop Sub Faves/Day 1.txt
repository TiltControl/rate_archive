[18:20:01] goorry12: there is like 0% chance that charli loses remix rate
[18:20:03] jirachi: yas
[18:20:22] Dachiii: The trick was that you have to click the "queue a song" button instead of the queue tracker that's next to the upvote/downvote button
[18:20:23] starlit: although atp i'd have to imagine self titled and Sucker are close to being rerateable
[18:20:33] freecuddlesanyone: remix rate is just a charli setup kinda
[18:20:46] starlit: self titled might be next year i'm assuming it's 5 years until a possible rerate
[18:21:31] starlit: but i think True Romance and Sucker could arguably be rerated if an idea came up; that being said, i think it's more likely she wins here or in that remix album rate idea
