[20:22:07] Hypnotica: :sob:
[20:22:10] ricki: i gave it a 10 because i genuinely think it's a good song but a moody slow electronic ballad making top (whatever we're at rn) can only happen with some help
[20:22:16] ricki: the help is everyone loving sophie and being moved
[20:22:22] BleepBloopMusicFan: I honestly prefer the remix a lot
[20:22:31] Dachiii: Which is the one about Sophie
[20:22:34] BleepBloopMusicFan: It has the same emotional impact but a more fun sound
[20:22:36] hikk: see i'm not like y'all i'm bold and unafraid of tomatoes being thrown at me (i gave it like a 7)
