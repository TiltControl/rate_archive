[22:27:31] vayyiqra: oh..
[22:27:35] bran: a song of all time
[22:27:36] kappyko: imagine if we were just lying about the order of the top ten the whole time
[22:27:39] ricki: TURN IT UP
[22:27:46] DraculaWeekend: this is a bop but not a rate winner
[22:27:48] Roxie: this song ever
[22:27:56] kappyko: anyways i cant be mad even though i think my ideal winner was kingdom come because 1. it's a b-side 2. it's amazing and unexpected
[22:27:56] ricki: @DraculaWeekend that is factually wrong
[22:28:00] ricki: HAH :tongue:
[22:28:04] cheatviathan: Definitely in the top 1% of songs in existence. Make of that what you will.
[22:28:05] DraculaWeekend: :(
[22:28:18] BiPolarBear17: kingdom come the immaculate winner you would've been
[22:28:20] noodles: it woulda been quite a shift if yukika won, but alas :')
[22:28:24] kappyko: i'm not gonna pretend this isn't my most played song of all time btw
[22:28:31] kappyko: otherwise my 11 would have been john doe
[22:28:32] Vexastrae: best song evar
[22:28:32] noodles: gay!
[22:28:36] noodles: (me too)
[22:28:37] Vexastrae: xd
[22:28:50] ricki: if it werent for this... well i think my 11 would have been sweet crazy love
[22:28:57] ricki: but shadow and i feel you kept calling me to 11 them
