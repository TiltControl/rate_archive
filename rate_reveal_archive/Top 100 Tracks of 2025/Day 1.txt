[16:19:30] SteelStepladder: Hiya!
[16:19:33] wathombe: so in 2012, ms. wathombe and i had just moved to the burbs, and we decided to take the train into Little Tokyo to our favorite restaurant for our anniversary. on the way home, the train was indefinitely delayed due to a [redacted] on the tracks.
[16:19:45] Stryxen: the most upvoted song in this room being Style from the 2014 top 100
[16:19:49] Stryxen: we were all so happy that day
[16:20:06] bigbigbee: ^
[16:20:23] wathombe: we opted to take the bus instead (traffic was also borked due to the [redacted]), which was packed, and there was a woman drunk of her ass on the bus with headphones on singing this song at the top of her lungs the entire two-hour ride.
[16:20:41] wathombe: we still laugh about that to this day
[16:20:47] Poydoo: :sob:
[16:20:49] fava: mike jones is not a real name you cant convince me it is

[22:18:23] seanderlust: Feeling Good by the Pussycat Dolls is the obvious winner though so at least there's that
[22:18:37] wathombe: btw there was SO much top 100 of 2005 promo going on at a karaoke night i went to last month; one of the KJs is apparently the exact right age and basically sang nothing but FOB and Panic! (including "I Write Sins")

[22:20:36] Stryxen: it better
[22:20:36] wolves: thats my one guess
[22:20:36] stealthamo: my initial thought for this song will always be the o.c., just because of how ridiculous that scene is
[22:20:38] ricki: hung up, we belong together, lose control top 3
